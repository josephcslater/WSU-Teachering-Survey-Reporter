10,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 11,"to further help us understand the course material, he would do in class example problems similar to our homework problems.  The professor was respectful and supplied a better teaching style towards the end of the semester. Going through examples in class helped a lot towards the end of the semester. However, teaching concepts through examples on a slide show I did not find helpful. During the class, the professor would click through the slides too fast and cause students to not have enough time to understand concepts. Having more explanation of problem processes would have been helpful too.  kind of clear  Class time seemed very rushed.  Difficult to understand at times, seemed to jump around alot and leave examples unfinished, confused students who were trying to understand how to be able to replicate the methods in homework and testing.  Instructor didn't give time to work problems out or takes notes. Example problems were already worked out so it was hard to follow along. Shouldn't read straight from powerpoint.  Great teacher, made topics very easy to understand, wish he could teach my upper level engineering classes  He is a good professor who knows the material very well. He is a little nervous when he lectures so it is hard to understand or hear him at some points, but other than that I enjoyed his class.  Nikolai was not very responsive with questions during class time, even when he asked if there were any questions. Every one of the lectures was powerpoint that was read word for word from the slides. The examples gone over in class were always entry level material into the topic, never helping with the difficult questions that would appear on homework and exams.  There were a lot of days that it was very hard to understand the material and whenever we work through problems in class, he speeds through them and it is hard to follow.  He is clear for the most part. I think he tries really hard to try and get us to understand the material but I think he has a hard time teaching it to the students. I think he handles questions pretty well for the most part and respects the individuals.  Examples problems were walked through during almost every lecture. A few more minutes could have been used for the ""quizzes"" during lecture.  excellent professor would take again takes things slow and makes sure you understand them. The class is well defined and there is no excuse for anything. Well Done!  K  He was overall a decent professor.  He could provide better explanation on the different topics that we learn. Also, provide better office hours that work with the students schedules.  Teaching dynamics off of pre-made PowerPoint slides made this class unbearable. Problems were almost never worked out on the board and could not really understand him very well. Tests were easy enough to do well, but the material was not taught well at all.  clear explanation and handling question very good.  He provided lots of examples, but some of the PowerPoint examples he went through too quickly to follow.  Examples were very clear but were often much simpler than the homework.  The examples were helpful, but I feel like some of the conceptual ones didn't help very much. More basic, specific problems would have been more useful  Did more lecturing than practical learning with doing problems, a lot of variable work problems that skipped many steps and were easy to get lost in.  He was okay but he could've been better. I do not think PowerPoint presentations are the most effective way of teaching Dynamics, and that's what a lot of this course consisted of. He definitely knew what he was talking about but sometimes he did not know how to explain it very effectively.  I think you're a very knowledgeable professor but the setup of the class and the lectures were not effective and not enough time was spent doing problems and understanding the material. Too much time was spent on the theoretical background and setup of equations or problems. I'm not the only one but most of the kids learn best when we see problems worked out and if equations are used that we don't understand or a concept we haven't seen before we're more inclined to ask questions about it.  I felt like the majority of the time he would ramble about stuff that was not important or did not pertain to the class. It was very hard to stay awake and keep focused in that class. He answered questions to the best of his ability being able to answer any question asked.  Teacher provided good examples in class. Sometimes the theory and process behind the examples were unclear.  Very clear explanations, but required participation and critical thinking  Nikolai is very knowledgeable and help my understanding greatly.  Excellent examples, always wanted students to learn.  Gave clear understanding examples for each problem and thoroughly explained them.  He was good in lecture.",2017 Spring
11,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 12,"yes, in class example problems, quiz questions, and power point notes were used to help us understand the course material.  The instructor supplied a basis of understanding of this subject. However, when it came to exams, I found myself teaching myself the processes. If more explanation was given in how the problems were carried out, I feel that the class would have helped with my understanding more. The classes felt rushed though and he seemed to skip over explanations.  yes  Yes. Brought in mechanisms for inperson examples, applied material to real life examples, and was helpful during office hours.  No, what I gained from this class I mostly taught myself, because in class examples were not from relevant course materials, and could not be validated or the answers checked. most frustrating  Not much if any  he had very informative power points and explains them very well  brought models in to display certain topics  Up until this point I have done well in the class, but my understanding in the subject has been entirely based on myself reading through the book and working through the examples. This is how you must learn most of the material in most classes, but it is nice when a professor seems excited about the subject and is willing to help clarify difficult material, which Nikolai is not.  Very little. All of the power points he had were not made by him and occasionally he wouldn't know what it was trying to do. He also would already have problems worked out that he would go over in class and instead of walking through a problem he would just copy what he already did. Whenever he would ask if there are questions, he rarely looked up to see if anyone actually had their hand raised. Which about 75% of the time there was.  He tried to. He brought items in like K'NEX to demonstrate the things we were learning.  Yes. With some of the examples, the instructor would being in hands-on gears and pulleys to help visualize what we were analyzing in class.  K  No, not really. Majority of the topics I learned I taught myself from the book, or depended on friends.  No, Math cannot be taught from pre-made PowerPoint slides. Examples should be done on the board.  yes, he aid my understanding of this subject  Yes, he was available to answer questions when I had them.  Yes, he was willing to explain problems to make sure we understood them.  The general course structure and examples in class helped  yes  He did help a little. He provided us with some examples, but the examples that he went over in class were much easier than the homework problems. Therefore, I had to teach myself a lot of the more complicated material.  Yes, the concept questions and quizzes helped a lot.  Not really, I had to teach myself everything throughout the semester  Yes.  Examples. Review Exams. Review of lectures.  Yes, provided multiple examples to aid in understanding the material  He was very helpful when i had quesions.  Yes. Gave good examples. Available for help outside of class.  Yes, with his lecture",2017 Spring
12,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 13,"i have no additional comments.  Explanations of solving problems through established processes would be helpful. Slowing down the class a little would be beneficial too. Students don't have enough time to read the slides.  none  The lectures and textbook material weren't always a sufficient amount of information to understand homework.  when going over examples he goes too fast and I cant always write everything down  I think Nikolai is a really nice guy and tries really hard but is just not good at conveying his message.  K  He's one of the better professor that teaches statics, dynamics. Overall, it's a easy class but not the best to learn the material.  nothing  I would have liked it if we got our homework back before taking exams so I know if I have been doing the problems correctly before the exam.  When he started doing practice problems in class, that was a good idea that somewhat kept my attention  Good instructor!  I liked the practice exams",2017 Spring
13,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 14,"i have no additional comments.  None.  Please at least act like you care about the students who paid to be in your class, makes us angry and spiteful when we are stuck with professors like you who couldnt care less if we learn by teaching ourselves or not. If you wont start to care, please have the decency of not teaching.  J  Only complain is the PowerPoint slides. Just seems like lazy teaching to me. Need to engage more with the students.  nothing  Practice problems in class were a good idea  Good instructor!  He was a good instructor",2017 Spring

38,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Examples provided were not applicable to either exams or real-life. Spent way too much time on theoretical happenings and did not touch on actual engineering examples.  Dr. Sucosky was up front about the difficulty of the class. However, he explained the materials well and quickly responded to any questions that students had. He gave plenty of examples and was clear on what was expected out of students.  Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor and one of the most intelligent people I have had the privilege to listen to. Does a great job at giving notes and material to the class that really contributes to the class learning.  Materials supplied via the website where very helpful.  His in class examples and explanations were clear. The homework however is greatly outside the realm of possibilities for students to be able to complete.  I liked how he gave handouts with notes on them, so that we can fill in the blanks; it was easier to follow along and write the notes, while still paying attention to what he was saying. Class time was spent wisely. He taught the course very well, considering it is a hard subject.  Some people have stated they feel as if he comes of a bit arrogant. I can not say I do not see what they are saying but I do not believe that it is intentional.  Very helpful professor. One of the best I've had so far at Wright State. Homework and notes were clearly laid out. Willing to answer any questions and helpful during office hours as well.  I did not like the way the homework was set up. I felt like my homework had to be perfect or my grade would suffer dramatically.  Philippe gave handouts as examples, which really helped the learning of the material. The handouts further helped explain the information, and the tests were based off them. He respected everyone equally.  He is a very good instructor, easy to understand, and explains the material well.  Thank you  Lectures were put together excellently. This is a very difficult course but the material provided made everything much easier. Being able to use resources such as our notes, handouts, and practice exams on the exams makes it easier to understand and show my obtained knowledge.  Very clear in explanations of coursework. Class was very well organized and seldom strayed off topic. He engaged the class well with guided notes and interactive simulations. He was very straightforward to the class about student expectations, responsibilities, and potential outcomes. Every piece of information that was necessary to excel on the tests and homework was provided to students in class or on his course website. He is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the subject and did his best to appeal to the level of knowledge of the students when answering questions and explaining difficult concepts. There were no surprises throughout the class because of how well it was organized and I feel that as a whole, students would be much more successful if all classes were structured like Sucosky's. I definitely learned a lot about the fundamentals of fluid mechanics throughout the semester.  Dr. Sucosky is among the top 5% of the best professors I have had the pleasure of learning from. He is highly organized in his presintation of information and able to answer complex questions with understandable answers. Thank you for the time spent with us.  the instructor has a strict system that works on making the students learning the material.  Dr. Sucosky was excellent in covering new topics and going over examples.  Overall handled questions well.  Not good, class time just keep  writing and reading it's not writing class  The problem I had was that he gave homework that he said not to study for the exam because they wouldn't be similar enough, but my study consists of doing homework. I don't have time to do homework that will be useless, then also study what is expected.  I appreciate his approach to the material.  Very organized professor, everything is very clear. If you have any questions, go up to his office hours and he will gladly help you. His tests are exactly what he says they will be and his review sessions are extremely helpful.",2017 Spring
39,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 12,"Instructor did a poor job of conveying useful information. Expectations of students were unclear in expectations for exams. Did not explain how any of the information we learned was applicable to any real-life scenarios.  Yes, he did. Made sure he went through every step in his example problems and note taking to make sure the students had clear idea on what to do, even with the extremely difficult material that is studied in fluid dynamics.  Again, he was a clear teacher. But homework is impossible to complete.  Yes, he gave real-world examples of things we were learning about. For example, one day he showed us how the velocity of air flows through an f1-formula car. I thought that was very interesting and it greatly sparked my interest in the subject.  He focused far too much on thorough and far to little on application. more example work and less how we get there would be extremely helpful.  Yes. Homework and notes were extremely helpful and could be used on tests. Practice exams were given for each exam as well as a review session was held. Very helpful overall  He provided very helpful handouts.  He did help aid in my understanding. Sometimes the information being wrote out was a little much, but overall the notes were helpful.  Yes  Yes, awesome  As I said above, the class was well structured and all material necessary for learning the topic was provided in the class and on his website. The book was mainly used for reinforcement and more in depth ""next level"" learning development. The instructor most definitely aided in my understanding of the subject because the students expectations and outcomes were clearly outlined in his class syllabus and everyday lecture. There were no surprises and I think many professors could learn a thing or two about how to structure a class from Sucosky. Intelligent, straightforward, and honest.  yes, he made sure I learned all the material by taking notes and using handouts.  Any questions I had, Dr. Sucosky was able to answer.  Yes. Answered all my questions in class.  No  I think he could have spent more time on examples. We spent days on proving the equation, then twenty minutes on an example of how to use it. When it came to the exam, the example was there, but in situations I hadn't seen or anticipated because I didn't know to anticipate them. After the first exam, we got examples of what to expect, the only problem was only one out of every three was something I had seen and could figure out how to solve properly.  He did, as everything was extremely clear and organized.  He did go over handouts and notes, but he did not give very many concrete examples. It was hard with the homework being so different from the things that were done in class to learn the material. Test questions were different than the homework and were very challenging.",2017 Spring
40,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 13,"Below average instructor.  Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor. I have no complaints about him, as he is a smart and intelligent man with a gift in teaching. My only issue was he did not respond to an email about one of my finals (potential grading issue), but it wasn't a huge deal.  Lower the difficulty of the homework.  Overall, he is a great professor. Taught the class very well and his exams were fair.  I was extremely interested in this class it was in fact probably the class I wanted to take most out of all required classes in my degree. But this class has become nothing more than a chore. We learned so little about how to actually solve for dynamic fluid problems and so much on base theories most of which we will not utilize.  Thanks  Awesome style of teaching  No additional comments.  Nothing  He was available for consultation yes, and he said people who came to his office often passed with higher grades. I would have liked it if he spent more time teaching what he expected us to know. I work, so I can't go to office hours all the time, I go to class to learn what I need to know.... only that it feels like he teaches everything EXCEPT what we are expected to know.  He is a very cool professor who clearly knows what he is talking about. If you cannot make it to his office hours, he will work with you in order to get you what you need. Overall a very good experience in the class.",2017 Spring
41,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 14,"Looked down on students. Assumed that if you didn't understand material immediately, you never would understand it.  Dr. Sucosky is a great professor. The material in this course is naturally difficult, but if one does as Dr. Sucosky instructs the course becomes a lot more manageable.  Thank you for a great semester!  Lower the difficulty of the homework.  One thing that I did not like was how he gave much harder problems on the homeworks than he did on the exams. I would have liked it better if he gave the same amount of difficulty on the homeworks as the exams. Alot of the homeworks i had a very hard time trying to solve them. If the homework was easier, it would have given us more practice problems similar to what is on the exams.  It is very helpful that the homework is worth 25% of the grade but It is so difficult compared the book/exam problems. If the homework represented problems that we would more likely see on an exam it would have been more beneficial.  Great teaching  He is a great teacher and very strict.

I felt Dr. Yang did a decent job teaching this course. I was aware going into the course it was his first time teaching the course, and at times it was apparent.

94,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"Clear with examples in class.  I did not follow along in class very much and when I did, it was tough and dry material. I preferred to just read the book to do my homework and study. I did not take any notes during class. I did ask Dr. Bae questions sometimes and he was always available to answer.  Great instructor! Many examples and clear explanation of material.  Dr. Bae is a great instructor. He works very hard to understand and answer the student's questions. He is always available to answer questions through email and office hours. He is very professional and respectful in his teaching and organized with the subject at hand.  The teacher is very knowledgable in the subject he is talking about and teaching. He does a lot of examples that are easy to understand for the most part. Sometimes he gets going fairly quickly and it is hard to keep up with him and follow what is happening.  Answered questions well. Writing on the board can sometimes be a tad small and hard to read.  Very good  Hard to follow along with what he is explaining sometimes, not real clear in explanations.  Sometimes seemed to get confused when someone asked a question or clarification but he did very well in explaining when he understood what was being asked.  Would like more working out of problems in class and less theory explanation  Dr. Bae did a very good job teaching this material.  I always enjoy his classes.  He does a lot of examples and really takes the time to help us learn the material.  Very good examples and explanations to in class problems that helped me understand the material.  Dr. Bae knows and taught the subject of Vibration of Mechanics very well.  Consequently, Dr. Bae instructing ethics has not been ""up to par"" (fair); to illustrate this,  Dr. Bae has penalized students for grievances he wasn't clear on (he never declared he would penalize), however, he did not penalize students for grievances he was clear on (he did say he would penalize on syllabus).  This type of teaching (inconsistencies) makes it unfair for all students that are under his instructing.  I think Dr. Bae has the potential of becoming a great teacher, but his bad ethical practices is one great hindrance to him and this great institution: I have had other master level students complain about his bad ethics.  This is constructive criticism and nothing personal.  As a matter of fact there has been time when Dr. Bae has shown good ethics with his students; consequently, this is very rare occurrence with Dr. Bae: hence he has potential of becoming a great professor. Thanks GAA  He could write a little bigger on the board. Depending on where you sit, it is difficult to see what is written.  Teaching was fairly well done. Sometimes had trouble figuring out what was being taught in class, and how it was different from previously learned material  Lots of examples which were helpful  I believe that Dr. Bae showed us many examples of everything that he expected of us. He was clear and precise on everything.  I felt like matlab was useless in this class. It is required to be able to do it on the homework which is useful but then can not be used on the exam.  The written notes on Pilot were helpful when reviewing and doing homework.  Numerous examples were covered in class for each topic.  The matlab code is helpful and helps students understand the solving procedure.  Examples were good and the instruction sound.  However the presentation was difficult.  PDF notes were projected onto the white board - not a screen, so there was a glare.  Half of the lights were on, so the dim lighting made the projection harder to read and the white-board handwriting difficult to read.  All handwriting was difficult to read.  The PDF notes were too small to read from the middle of the room. Office hours were good though, and the professor was patient in his explanations.  Lectures were useful. Definitely helped for exams. Exams had questions that were prepared so that they tested knowledge of the subject without any major tricks.  While there is a small difficulty understanding some words from time to time, Dr. Bae is very good about making sure that the students understand the material and the content he is trying to relay. The examples always help in understanding the theory and formulas. He is very open to questions, and does a very good job answering them satisfactorily. He does a great job with providing conceptual examples to understand the problems.  he is one of the best in ME  Examples are good, but instructor is sometimes hard to understand.  Explained topics well despite his accent and treated students well.  The examples in class made it clear on how to use the principles being taught, and what each variable was explained in depth. The class can clearly be a difficult class to teach, and Dr. Bae did a great job.  The only negative opinion I have of the class was trying to keep notes. As I was writing notes I had a hard time keeping up with the notes he would write in class and the notes that were projected on the board. It made it difficult to keep up with the writing and pay attention to the lesson.  I felt that to much of the class this semester revolved around reading straight from the notes on the projector. I've had Dr. Bae Previously and he was an excellent professor. Felt as though he wasn't as confident on this material.  Dr. Ha-Rok Bae was always good at answer questions of students in a clear and straight forward manner. Unless the answer was about to come up in the next portion of the lecture, then he would have the student wait to see if the question was answered after the lecture covered the material.  Most classes were spent doing examples which really helps in the understanding of the material. Most professors only focus on content with no examples making the class difficult to understand. This is not one of those classes  Dr. Bae is one of the better professor's at the university. Funny guy bringing some levity to the dry material.  Needs to spend more time on examples and not just going over the notes that are given. Just make students read before class and then do problems.  Gives good examples. I have enjoyed the chapter 4 lectures, but I thought CH 1-3 were boring. That's more of an issue with content than teaching style though.  Dr. Bae is one of my favorite professors at WSU, everything was fine.  Very Clear. My third time taking him in a class, and I Love his classes.  The professor's teaching is good. The explanation and examples are not up to the standard of exam conducted  From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding. He answers each and every questions or doubts.  From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding.

95,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"Yes reviewing multiple examples helped  Yes, I saw him in his office for help on the homework and he helped me to make sense of the material.  Dr. Bae aided in my understanding by answering my questions through email and after class.  The instructor did aid in my understanding of the subject through the examples he did in class. Homework that was assigned was also a good way to learn the various subjects we were talking about.  Yes he did  Not at all, almost everything I learnt during the class was self taught. Dr. Bae has a teaching style that is hard to follow and at most times doesn't make sense.  In some regards yes, it was sometimes hard to figure out what exactly we were solving for in a problem or what certain variables meant.  Very much so  Dr. Bae does a great job of taking the time to explain the material to us.  The only criticism I would give is that the notes could be hard to follow in class and I wasn't always sure what material was important to record, and what material should not be recorded.  The class was very fast paced, so this made it difficult to follow as Dr. Bae would switch between the notes and examples and it could get confusing.  Yes Dr Bae gave real world examples that I could relate to which made the material easier.  Dr. Bae has the potential of aiding, but he tends to discourage students from asking questions; to illustrate, he compares other students ability to figure out a problem quicker than that student that couldn't (office hours): which can disable a student from asking for aid from Dr. Bae.  Besides that, he taught the subject very well.  Yes. He would stay after class to help answer some question we had or would ask us to come to his office hours.  Yes, was able to visually show how an object would move by using Matlab. Which also helped to see how changing the parameters affected the system.  Yes, I learned alot  Yes, Dr, Bae was much more clear than the book for this course and made sure that we understood everything before moving on.  Dr. Bae simplified each solving method into a list of simple steps to break down problems. He also went through matlab code to show how these steps are used and how they work together.  Yes. He answered conceptual questions to the best of his ability.  Yes, Dr. Bae was always very open to questions and helpful in answering them in or out of class.  yes does a great job  I asked for clarification on a topic and he cleared up the confusion.  Dr. Bae did a great job explaining, answering questions, and knowing when the class was overwhelmingly confused. He would stop periodically to ask the class if there were questions and would take time to make sure the questions were answered.  Yes, some examples were helpful  Yes, I had a question about mode shape responses and he was able to meet with me directly after class to clear up my confusion.  Yes. As stated above the examples really help to build an understanding of the material and how to apply it.  Yes, he likes to use colorful MATLAB plots to demonstrate a vibration analysis. Again, helps create more interest in the subject.  Yes. good professor.  Good person.  Yes, he gives good lectures and the homeworks were extensive.  yes  Yes he did. He provided numerous examples, and stimulated thinking  Yes, Professor helps in getting the clarity of the subject and specific topics. Dr. Bae clarified my doubt related objects response to resonance conditions and the possibility to create virtual machine which can convert excess resonance energy to useful form.

96,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,"I thought the class was taught well.  No further comment  Poor teaching style.  Dr. Bae did a great job when showing how to solve the ""Vibration of Mechanics"" problems using Mat Lab: according to what I have learn previously in Mat Lab.  While being able to view the PDF on pilot greatly helped, I had trouble following some of the material when the PDF was used in class.  Dr. Bae is an excellent professor.  nope  N/a  It would seem that the lab and the lecture are not even related. The labs are months ahead in the material and really only provide as an exercise in MATLAB than anything to do with vibration analysis. Painful 4 weeks.  No.  The homeworks were often very long and time consuming, I think it could serve for those to be cut down and targeted closer to the types of problems on exams. 5-6 problems per homework would have been better than 10-12 problems  One of the best engineering professors here at Wright State  Everything was good except the time given to solve problems. The time was insufficient to perform to my full extent.  Mechanical vibration is very challenging subject but, Dr. Bae helped me in understanding the subject by answering my doubts and query.

97,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"I thought this class wasn't too bad.  I know it's the hardest in the major and I thought the intuition a gained from this class will be useful.  The ability to research more on my own and do a deeper analysis if I am required isn't out of the question either.  Thanks Dr. Bae  I would suggest providing some solutions to the homework assignments before the homework is due. This helps in learning if the students get stuck so they can see how the problem is properly solved rather than doing it wrong the first time and thinking it is right.  Overall the class was taught fairly well. The examples were good and the homework helped aid in the understanding of these examples. The labs were alright but they it was hard sometime to understand and follow along with what the lab was looking for.  None  When student's would find mistakes in the notes he posted online in Pilot, he didn't make note of the changes so he could correct the notes at a later date. It's unknown if he ever went back and re-uploaded corrected notes. Anyone who missed that class or stepped out of the room for those few minutes when the correction was brought up would never know, and could possibly have now incorrect formulas or methods on crib sheets or homework  Dr. Bae did a great job and I enjoy his classes!  All the info I have provided has been only the truth and nothing personal (not trying get anyone in trouble); I would hope this will generate a healthy dialogue for Dr. Bae.

108,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"The labs were not explained very well. Most of the information in the lab manual was not well explained or collected in a readable manner.  Lab time was spent horribly, most of the labs we stood for the whole class period and never had to do a thing. Then we would collect data that the TA did for us and leave without any explanation on how to use the matlab functions that were required to get your results.  Labs were long but related to class so that helped make them easier  The labs were often repetitive and given with such instruction that put the focus on understanding matlab and not about understanding what was going on.  Labs were taken from when Dr. Slater took it, so the TA wasn't always familiar with the material. He was helpful with what he did know, but many things he did not know.  Class was actually handled by a TA.  Explanations of labs were straightforward, demonstrations helpful.  Explained topics well, answered questions with clarity, and treated student very respectfully.  Sazzad did the best that he could with what he had to work with.

When arriving at the lab we were given a packet which was difficult to relate to what was going on in the lab. If I had an opportunity to look over it before coming I would have benefited.

110,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,I think if the lab manuals were easier to read and the lab was explained a little better it would be easier to understand what was happening.

111,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,I think there needs to be more hands on portions to the lab.

122,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"The TA for this lab did a good job at explaining the labs but there could've been a better way to present the material in a more organized fashion.  The labs were poorly written and the questions were extremely difficult to answer with the given data collected in the lab.  Not always because the data was flawed, although it was occasionally, but mostly because the lab did not teach us how to appropriately analyze the data and the lab was way ahead of the material that we learned in class.  So it made it absurd and not very useful.  The lab was a little less well put together in my opinion. I still learned from it, and it was nice to see the content from the class actually put into practice, but I learned more from the class itself.  Dr. Bae is good the TA of the lab though is a complete moron. Does not really seem to know any of importance except what is explicitly shown in the rubric.  The labs were too compressed and didn't match with the subject matter being taught in lecture.  Class was handled by TA. The first lab was not properly explained, but subsequent ones were much better.",2017 Spring
123,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"The TA did not explain a lot of the details within the lab that were crucial to solving for the solutions in the lab.  The T.A. was very nice, but he wasn't always very helpful because even he didn't always agree with what was written in the lab.  Yes, Dr. Bae as well as the teaching assistant did a good job answering questions and presenting the material in a straightforward way.  The labs were difficult to get through, especially the first one. Maybe looking at lowering the difficulty somewhat.  The TA helped somewhat",2017 Spring

Labs were a bit hard to follow  Bae didn't conduct the lab, a TA did who was terrible at explaining the lab, answering questions, or encouraging thinking that expanded further from the lab conducted. Generally like the labs were hitting something with a hammer and praying for the best in results from the computer, other than that not much was explained in any clarity.  Labs did not line up with lectures also did not beinifit to learning just made understanding harder it took time away from homework and studying just adding difficulty with no gain  The lab was explained all the way through using the lab manual and the TA was very helpful when obtaining the experimental data.",2017 Spring

I kind of enjoyed seeing the results of the labs.  I think this could be a very fun lab. I think the theory parts for lab were a bit of overkill in some respects.  For a couple we weren't at that point in the lecture.  I actually skipped the theory part and saved myself the headache.  I honestly felt it was wasteful of my time.

150,ME 4210L,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"The labs were not that challenging: we didn't do the labs we only watched and somewhat participated.  However, the lab reports were challenging.  Most importantly, the lab reports were much farther ahead then the class homework assignments, which made it harder to apply what we learned in class to the labs; unfortunately, this made the lab reports unnecessarily more confusing on interpreting the info we obtained.  The prelab lesson was not clear. We jumped from page to page and it was hard to comprehend all of the material. The matlab was extremely hard to do by yourself. I do not like to ask to many questions and found it difficult to figure out. When the lab was being conducted the instructor did a very good job. He knew how to use to use the program and how to explain what the information was we were looking for.  It's fine that you wanted to challenge us in this course, but you didn't quite nail giving us all the tools we needed.  The main issue was a lack of explanation of the functions that we were required to use or what they did.  Now granted, they probably where explained in each lab, but a single typed up chart to explain what the inputs are (I.e. units and where the program got them) and what the outputs are (units) in a single typed up sheet with the words ""DO NOT LOSE"" might be a better option than the piece meal version.",2017 Spring

192,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"Clarity of explanations - The instructor repeats the explanation that is provided in the recommended textbook. I don't understand the point of coming to the class if I have to read and hear the same lines. Examples - Same as above. The instructor didn't take efforts to solve examples outside of the textbook. More emphasis was given on completion of the course syllabus rather than the student's understanding.  Personally, I would prefer that less lecture time is spent on the derivations of various equations. Although derivations are helpful for understanding the assumptions involved in various methods, examples of how the equations are used are much more effective at helping to cement the method in my mind. I'm not saying to focus exclusively on examples. It would just be nice to shift the balance a bit. I would also have appreciated it if Dr. Bae used some examples which didn't come directly from the text. That way, more than one example would be available to help clarify the use of the different methods. Finally, it would be more manageable if the homework assignments were split into smaller assignments due more frequently.  The professor needs to do more examples that aren't straight from the book. After seeing only one example, it was very difficult to do the homework and do well on the tests.  Good  Because the book is not easy to read and understand, for me the examples are important to understand the class. But the example is not enough, it makes me hard to catch up the class. Handout material also could not help me a lot.  But this is the first time Dr. Bae teach this course, so it is could be understood for his difficulty.  excellent method for teaching and also answer all of the students questions during the class.  Everything was well organised.  Instructor was clear with his teaching and examples . Answered the question to the point with valid explanation. Instructor respect the individual and allow student to speak and ask question during lecture hours.  -Instructor provided good explanation of all topics of this course along with many examples. He also used to asks question during class that allows us to think on that topic. He also used to respect each individuals. He used to clear the doubts of each individual till that students get clear understanding.  Dr. Bae is an overall good professor and this course went as well as it probably could have being his first time teaching it.  One improvement that could be made adding more examples (beyond what is included in the textbook) and having a solution to the homework available before the homework is assigned so he can more easily help students on homework if they have trouble.  One minor thing, when doing equations on the board, please write your ""w"" and ""omega"" symbols differently.  It was difficult to tell sometimes when he was talking about displacement (w) or natural frequency (omega).  Also, always be sure to use different symbols for different quantities, for example towards the beginning of the class there was a mix up between ""H"" for the hamiltonian and the ""H"" matrix. I would also like to see more numerical methods taught in this course rather than just the theory since this is ""computational"" methods for structural dynamics.  Other than those minor things, job well done for the first time teaching the course.  1) During my Graduation, Dr. Bae is one of best professor and always very helpful. 2) He explaining example very well during the class so that we can easily solve the homework problem even in exam problem too. 3) Dr. Bae is awesome. He explain everything very well and I learned a lot from him. If I get a chance, I would like to be a future student under him. And suggest other student also to be a part of it. 4) He is very energetic during class and always positive. He is very respectful and cares about the whole class. 5) He gave us excellent knowledge about different kind of software like MATLAB, Mathematica.  The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students. I like the way he took personal care of the problems arose from the individual students.  Good",2017 Spring
193,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared for class. Im sure he will get better when he gets more experience teaching the course.  Yes  He really tried to make sure all students understand the class, but it is hard to know comprehend all knowledge in class.  yes definitely. at the starting off the class he took a per-requisite test for this subject. and he also provide all the materials for study. its really good that he took that test because we can have some basic of this subject clear.  Yes.  yes instructor was helpful in understanding this subject. Any doubt asked was cleared with an example which help in understanding the subject and also did relative examples in class to help understanding the structure.  -Yes instructor aided in understanding this subject well. He used to clear my doubts during class time or even after class in office hours. He used to give different examples so that I can understand the topic well.  Yes  As I said earlier that I like the way he teaching the subject by explaining everything very well.  And understanding of example during the class helps in exam and homework problem. I was challenged in this course but Dr. Bae made easy to understand this subject.  Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept.  Yes, Classes have been interesting.",2017 Spring
194,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,"To be honest, I don't understand the point of appointing an instructor if all he does is re-write whatever is given in the textbook with no additional information. It would have saved the students a lot of money and time if they were directly told to read the textbook and appear for an exam.  Nothing else  Please, please add more example to help students understand the knowledge. If possible, teach some knowledge about the software you used in class. If possible, change the book, it is not friendly to students (like me).  No further comments. Instructor was fluent with his teaching and examples.  -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor.  This class is very important and has many application in my focused area in future or in job.  Great teaching in all subject that I had took under him. He has excellent knowledge about software.  Everything is good",2017 Spring
195,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"Examples - More examples from outside the recommended textbook will go a long way in helping the student's learning.  This is the first time to Dr. Bae teach this class? This is a really hard course, hope he can help more students to understand the techniques used in this class.  -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor.  At the last, Dr. Bae is very very very good professor.  I would like to take the subjects in future under this instructor.  This is not regarding the Professor. Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly.

Dr. Gockel did many example problems during class, which was helpful in practice.  She was very thorough with answering any questions we had to ensure we understood the answer. She respected all individuals equally.  Dr. Gockel did a good job using examples, answering questions, and explaining the material effectively for the students to learn.  Dr. Gockel was a fantastic professor and  was very clear in every thing she expected from her students.  Sometimes explanations were vague and confusing, but she did well handling questions from the class and did her best to guide students to understand the topic more clearly. First year teaching the course and it was noticeable  Very clear real world explanations.  The examples in class were very useful to reflect on while doing the homework. Since there are a TON of equations, it was nice to have some examples that used them. The homework was actually useful to do, unlike many of the other courses I have taken at Wright State. The exams were similar to the homework problems, which seems to be an oddity in the engineering classes. She handled any questions I had, and answered anyone's questions in class.  In class she was fine.  She provided both theory and real-world examples.  She would go a little too fast at times, and wouldn't thoroughly explain every step to every problem sometimes.

Assigning a major project with half the allotted time listed in the syllabus was a total foul.  Halfway through the class she gave us a break which I strongly believe helped keep us engaged during lecture. Knowing we had a 5-10 minute break also helped the class time go quicker and not drag.  Only issues I really had was taking too long of a break during the class. She usually would give a 5 minute break halfway through. I would rather just have pressed through and finished early. Also, she wrote slightly too small for certain parts of the room to see. Other than that, no problems.  Nice woman, good teacher. I'd take her again for other courses.  She could sometimes be a little vague, and I feel as though she was a little bit unorganized when it came to a comprehensive list of what we've learned.

220,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 11,"Professor Gockel is a highly motivated individual, who is organized in her teaching methods. While lecturing she breaks down the information into chunks that follow the syllabus to a point. When it comes to answering questions she is respectful of students, not simply saying ""no"", ""incorrect"" or ""not even close"" she tries to understand where the students question is coming from. Giving an opportunity to explain why the question was brought up initially, and how to solve for the students question. She not only teaches the subject at hand but as well as critical thinking skills.  Joy was easily one of the best professors I've had at wright state. She provided several examples throughout the class and made sure to allow time for students to ask questions. Everything in the class seemed fair and she treated everyone with respect during the duration of the course. I really wish I had the opportunity to have her as a professor again.  Overall, instructor was good. However exams were slightly ambiguous and more challenging than previous examples.  Dr. Gockel is a very good professor, she is very good with the subject and was quick to reply to  questions the students had.  She does a lot of examples and answers a lot of questions to further our understanding.  She also gives pop quizzes every once in a while to keep us sharp.  The final project is a great way for us to apply what we've learned.  Very clear. Told you what she wanted you to know. Exams were a little over the top though.  She was a very good teacher, always answered any questions right away clearly and always respected her class.  The instructor was average with regards to this.  Lectures were straight to the point and notes given were extremely helpful for homework as well as exams. Everything was explained in a clear and concise manner.  Dr. Gockel was very good at explaining things in a clear and concise manner. She also handled questions from the class well and also was able to inject a lot of real world information into the lectures.  She is easily the best instructor I had this semester when is comes to teaching the courses material. I learn more in her one week review of mechanics of materials course than I learned the in the whole previous Mechanic of materials course.  yes  Spent class understanding equations needed to solve problems  Clear examples, responded to questions clearly, concisely, and helpfully, and was always respectful.  Ava;iable during office hours, kind and was good at helping answer questions  Professor Gockel always treated the class and the questions of the student with great respect and provided us with organized material that she tried to make as clear as possible.  Very good at explaining things and handling questions.  Very clear. Easy to understand. Willing to slow things down so people actually understand.  The teacher has a well made system in teaching this course. I enjoyed this class very much from the way she taught it. she used class time very well and did example problems to make sure the students know what they are doing.  No additional comments.  Her teachung style was very easy to listen to and understand. The examples she did were applicable and dine in an orderly and simple way. She made it easy to speak up in class and provided overall a good learning environment.  The professor was very clear in her explanation of the material. She frequently asked questions to keep the students engaged and to see how well we were following along.",2017 Spring
221,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"For Mechanical Design, Professor Gockel was always open to new ideas and questions relative to better understanding lecture. For whatever questions that were asked she would lead you in the right direction but allow you to arrive at the conclusion. By doing this it makes learning the material easier and more effective.  Yes, Joy was available during and outside of office hours to provide extra help. I had needed to meet her one day and she was respectful and helpful in making sure we understood the topic before we left her office.  Instructor was very good at explaining concepts.  She's cool brah.  The material that she taught in the class was helpful for me to succeed in her class. she good helpful explanations.  Not overly.  Most of this class was self taught. Of the lecture time, we spent maybe 10% going over what we truly needed. The rest of the time was spent going through long mathematical proofs on how we derived the formulas for our calculations in the first place. The class should be about application.  If we want to know were our approaches come from, we should simply take the initiative to find that portion on our own. We are tested over our ability to apply these formulas to situations.  As such, our time should be spent learning how to apply, not how we obtained the approach in the first place. I can safely say little of class time was beneficial to learning how to do anything in the real world.  Very willing to answer any questions that arose in class. All homework was related to material that was just covered in class and was comparable to questions that were given all the exams. Had flexible office hours if students needed extra help.  Absolutely. The lectures were very organized and easy to follow even when the content was difficult.  yes  Dr. Gockel provided lots of theory in class and spent time making sure the equations were explained in class  Yes. She provided good examples hat were neither too simple to be connected to assignments, nor too hard to understand.  Yes. Her weekly quizzes helped me know how I was doing with the conceptual portion of this class and assisted in me in making sure that I knew how to attack most problems when considering my approach.  Yes  Yes  yes, she used example problems to teach the material.  No additional comments.  She was very helpful in my understanding if this subject. I don't know if there is a specific example, but just they way she teaches makes thing easier to grasp than someone else might.",2017 Spring
222,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"The tests are absolutely inexcusably too long. Never before have I been in a class where I was unable to finish a test due to simple time, rather than clarity of material. At no point did I stall or was I held up in any way on the test material, yet I was unable to finish in time. We had a 55 minute test, including time to hand out, and there were 11 parts, not counting the graduate problem.  Even if the tests were able to be instantaneously handed out, this is only 5 minutes per part. During our final class day Dr. Gockle actually stated ""it is my goal to create a test that 25% are done with 30 minutes remaining. By the end to have 50% to 75% to be finished"".  By stating this, it means she aims for 25%-50% of the class to be incapable of finishing her test in the allotted time. This is completely irreprehensible. Some have stated that is actually the school’s goal.  If this is true, and I hope it is not, it is still irreprehensible as we are paying costumers not people being done a favor. We pay to be educated on the material.  As such, the goal should be to help us learn the material.  And with learning as the main focus, on a fair test, anyone who did not  make truly poor decisions regarding learning the material should have no problem finishing the test and achieve an average grade, that being a C.  It seems as though her goal is to be certain that some of us fail, rather than learn.  And with an intentional lack of adequate time, she is not judging our knowledge at all, but rather how quickly we can guess.  Best ME professor in College of Engineering  Often times, I felt we spent class time deriving/ learning too many equations but not solving problems. While I was in class, it made sense but trying problems on my own were often times difficult and I had little to no examples to reference.  Exams were setup to take the entire class period assuming no mistakes were made, they felt a little long  No further comments  Tests were unfair for the 55 minute time block. Material was fair just to much of it  Professor Gockel seems like a very nice and respectful person that is very enthusiastic about her job. I have learned  a ton thanks to her teaching.  No additional comments.  Just that when I say she made it easy to learn that doesn't mean the material was necessarily easy. It was pretty hard, but she gave the right tools to be able to figure out the work.",2017 Spring
223,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 14,"Wonderful professor, cannot wait to take Mechanical Design 2! :)  She is a very good instructor  Best teacher I've had this semester and maybe ever at Wright State. Wish I had a chance to take her again.  Everything in her class was reasonable. The only issue I had was the two mid-terms were too long for the given time frame.  The material on the exams was very fair, my only complaint was that it was a lot of material to cover in only a 55 minute exam time frame.  No further comments  A very good professor. I would definitely take another class taught by her again.  I enjoyed the class interaction that the instructor demonstrated, such as continuously asking questions of the class.  You are an excellent teacher keep up the good work.  No additional comments.  I really enjoyed this class.",2017 Spring

234,ME 2210,Sheng Li,Question 11,"Very clear on what was needed to be known for exams. Always provided examples. He made me feel confident going into exams.  Gave clear explanations and answered questions well.  Good professor with lots of examples. Only downfall is he writes out rhw whole problem word for word on the board and it can get quite long and drawn out.  He would explain and give good examples. Ask question to try to make us think.  Thorough and efficient in his teaching style. Gave us lots of example problems in class and very concise review sessions before exams so that we knew what to expect. He didn't mess around or try to trip us up, the class structure was very well defined and straight forward.  Examples were helpful in clarifying needed points or special cases. Questions were adeptly answered.  teaching was kind of dry, very monotone, did do examples in the lecture which was nice, could do something to make the class more interesting.  Teaching was clear and easy to understand.  Provided a good number of example problems we went through in class which was very helpful.  All around great teacher and a good guy.  The instructor went through many examples during class time and made sure that the class understood them. He also made sure the students know that if they understood the in class problems then they would do well on the exam.  very good instructor  As Sheng Li lectures he writes down nearly everything on the white board. (This is very useful!) At the beginning of class he explains the general principles and equations and next he demonstrates how to use those equations & principles to solve problems by applying them to several examples. His examples are chosen to show how these equations and principles can be used in different real world situations. He tries to make solving these examples an interact process by asking us what the next step might be. After all he is teaching problem solving. He would always ask if we had questions and always answered them to the best of his ability.  As for respect for individuals and their differences, I assume he met that criteria since the topic never crossed my mind until this survey mention it. This was never an issue in this class.",2017 Spring
235,ME 2210,Sheng Li,Question 12,"Yes. The examples that were provided through out class gave a clear outline of what was needed for the exams.  Yes  Yes if asked a question he would do his best to try and explain.  Yes. He would give good examples and explain very well.  Yes, explained things in relatable ways with plenty of examples as I said above.  ehh. not really.  The number and clarity of examples helped my understanding of Dynamics.  yes  He went over pretty much everything he had listed in the Syllabus, explaining each topic completely and demonstrating the all the equations and formulas each topic generated. I was very satisfied with his lectures. His whiteboard notes were legible enough, pertinent, and comprehensive. If  a student took very good notes they would only need to refer to the text book occasionally for help.  It is hard to single out specific examples: his teaching style was consistent lecture to lecture. In each lecture he would define and explain the topic matter and then demonstrate how the newly introduces principles could be used for problem solving by utilizing a variety of examples that would utilize those principles various ways to arrive at a solution. He kept things simple and straightforward.",2017 Spring

Really good at answering questions.  Thank you for all of your help  I love how this class was taught. I like leaving a class with a notebook FULL of relative information and examples. Dr. Li utilized the white board and made every effort to give us all of the course note. It motivated me to come to class because I wanted to learn more about the subject. Very linear pace as far as the project was concerned. If you took good notes, payed attention, and went to each class and consulted in office hours, it was a good project that is understandable.  Dr Li always gave examples related to real life applications and comparisons on how the theories of the subject were applied to the industry and what the industry expects from new graduates  He is a very motivative teacher, never degrades his students. Explains things very patiently which is one of the most important things I like.  The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students. I like the way he took personal care of the problems arose from the individual students.  Amazing faculty to have , Crystal clear explanation  Professor taught us  with good practical insight.",2017 Spring

Dr. Li had plenty of questions asked to him during this semester and he answered each one and tried to make it applicable to the class.  yes. when ever we had doubts in class he gave specific examples considering real life applications  Yes  Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept.  Her showed us the lab and that helped me a lot to understand the practical application of the theory  Yes, With the project he helped me a lot in finishing it early.",2017 Spring
250,ME 4190,Sheng Li,Question 13,"Great professor, highly recommend  I liked the teaching style. So much learned about bearings and lubrication. For something that is overlooked most of the time, this was an excellent introduction to the process.  Everything is good  It's all good",2017 Spring
251,ME 4190,Sheng Li,Question 14,"I liked how prepared Dr. Li was for the class. The notes say it all. Very detailed and helpful. Labeled well too. Anyone can make power points, but I was glad to see that I was not bored in class because the notes and pace forced me to pay attention and learn the material.  The course was practical with projects which helped in learning unlike written exams where you don't really learn anything.  Overall a good experience  This is not regarding the Professor. Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly. This will benefit every one who is interest but kind of feel tough to grasp the teachings.",2017 Spring
252,ME 4180,Akm Mian,Question 1,"Dr. Mian does a pretty good job overall. Needs to review his notes to better lay out what points are crucial.  Excellent  Pretty low. You can tell he is a a knowledgeable person but he just cant seem to convey it in a meaningful way, and often gets lost in the details. Most lectures feel like they are winged and have little practical knowledge for the purpose of an undergraduate course.  Dr. Mian was effective.  A bit hard to understand at times but overall is complete and does give all of the information.  He's a nice guy, but his ability to convey a subject in class leaves a little to be desired. He's very knowledgeable though.  Considering that this is a new course and Dr. Mian has only taught it once before this semester, he struggled in deciding which topics he wanted to focus on. It seemed as if he was 'winging' it the whole semester. With that said, I would rate it overall performance a 6/10.  Good  best instructor i have seen ever  great  Great  Dr. Mian was a very good instructor for this course and was helpful.  He is a great professor and we learned a lot in 3D-printing, which the future of the industry. He's knowledgeable on the subject.  He is very supportive with student. And he always available for answering emails.  HE IS DOING VERY WELL HE TRIED ALL THE BEST  Very effective  Okay. Could of been organized a little better. Return rate of grades was bad. Homework was straight forward and reflected what he put on the exams.  Dr. Mian has good intentions. I think class time was used reasonably well. For an Additive Manufacturing class, I would have thought we would spend more time in the lab talking about the machines and settings used on those.  very good  Taught material well, but scheduling assignments and dates not good. Not enough time to prepare last 2 weeks which for graduate students is 50% of your grade.  Very effective by describing the material behind the course as well as showing numerous examples. The instructor was very good teaching and helping the students.  Very knowledgeable.  Lectures were clear and understandable.  Good  not bad  yes  Good  good",2017 Summer
253,ME 4180,Akm Mian,Question 2,"It seems no. I am not sure he, his grader, and the students were ever on the same page as to what was expected as far as answers.  Yes  Yes.  Expectations seems to be not well defined.  yes  Basically kept to the syllabus.  Not quite. Him and his T.A. has different grading criteria's when it came to homeworks. Dr. Mian instructed us to do homeworks a particular way, but the grader wanted a different, more in-depth, approach during which he took off many points off homeworks. When the class informed Dr. Mian about the situation, he did nothing to change the outcomes and did not take initiative to correct the situation. Rather, he told us to go to the T.A. individually and talk to him, which from personal experience, was no help. On his exams, the questions were very open ended. For the project presentations, he gave me outlines for which to follow and he was very harsh on some groups because they didn't talk about things that Dr. Mian wanted them to talk about, even though Dr. Mian gave us no guidance or restrictions.  Good  yes  Awesome  Yes, he worked very closely to the expectations described in the course syllabus.  Yes  YES, SURE  Yes  Yes  Yes.  yes  Yes, he graded and evaluated my work based on the solutions he gave out in class in order to help us reach our goal of understanding.  Yes.

He would not post notes online because he wanted more people to come to class. But then would not give a good lecture.  Dr. Mian used many examples from current research in addition to videos.  by taking us to labs to see the equipment  Decently.  4/10  Good  funny and nice slides  He always made sure everyone understood the current subject before he moved on which was always helpful.  He actually did the best in trying to deliver the idea of addtive manufacturing  HIS WAY TO DELIVER THE TOPIC VERY ORGANIZED  Would provide more explanation if examples were unclear  Yes  Answering questions in class to the best of his ability. If he didn't have an answer he would look it up outside of class and come back the next day with an answer.  very good  Talked about manufacturing industries and applications that is relatable.  Asked if we ever needed help or to ask questions at any time.  We discussed future education plans during office hours.  Showing some related videos  not bad  pretty well  very interested  yes",2017 Summer
256,ME 4180,Akm Mian,Question 5,"Communicates well, typically answers questions the best he can and responds pretty quickly to emails.  Very good  Average, which is not great.  Generally, Dr. Mian communicated well. However, criteria for homework and exams seemed a bit undefined.  reasonably well.  He would email the class, but with the new outlook changes it was difficult. Some emails people wouldn't get. Fix outlook.  6/10  Good  he is awesome  The instructor communicated well both in and out of the classroom through both Pilot and email.  He was always available through email and office hours and sometimes he is available in his office without his office hours time.  VERY QUICK AND UNDERSTAND  Very effective through email and in person  Answered emails most of the time. Office hours were offered.  Frequently by email . And open door policy  excellent  No well.

A little disorganized  He would sometimes go on tangents. But they'd be relief tangents.  No, but that could be because it is a new course that has only been taught once before this semester.  Good  yes  The course content and lectures were a little unorganized at times but overall he did a good job at staying organized.  Yes  YES, VERY WELL  Yes  Final 50% of our grade in the class was scheduled for the final week of the class. Class content was organized. The delivery of the content throughout the long term of the class was poor.  Yes, for the most part. Some of the material was a little dated.

No  asdf  I would have appreciated a more practical approach to the course instead of going so far into the theory.  none  Dudes nice.  No  no  f  No.  No  I JUST WANT TO THANK Dr. Mian  he is the best one in University his style of dealing it is of good and respect  No  Maybe to give grad students more time with the assignments. Think about it, we had 50% of our grade spread out over the 11 week term which included 2 exams and homework. The project that was assigned wasn't given a good description of what was to be expected. In addition, the literature review paper is a lot of work for 10% of the course grade and a limited amount of time to do it. These reviews are for thesis students that take 30 weeks to complete it, not 5. Plus there is a take home final, which with past experience I know will take more time than an in class final. So the last 50% of the course grade is determined in a matter of 3 days. Some people work well under pressure, others don't. Try to spread out the grades and assignments so students that want to put their best foot forward on the paper have the opportunity to do so.  no  Great class very helpful.  No.  No  nope",2017 Summer
260,ME 3350,Jose Camberos,Question 1,"Very good professor, has a practical lecture which is very engaging.  very detailed in teaching and understanding.  Good professor and great with lecture style of explaining content and then providing examples to follow.  Really excited about teaching. Very passionate about the subject.  Very helpful  Professor Camberos is an excellent instructor for fluid dynamics, and any subject related to thermo-fluids.  ok  meh  Neutral  good  Effective- took extra time to discuss in depth issues as they presented themselves.  Responsive, logical and consistent in stating expectations from students.  he's very helpful and try's to do everything for the student.  Taught at a high level.  Jose was an incredible instructor. Along with fluid dynamics, I gained a deeper knowledge in thermodynamics, calculus and differential equations. He displayed his breadth of knowledge by describing the material clearly and relating it to previous knowledge. He made the class enjoyable and interactive. I was looking forward to going to his lectures. Above all else, he was fair, kind and understood the expectations of an undergraduate class.  The instructor was very effective in his teaching method and style overall.  Mr. Camberos was an effective teacher at times. Sometimes the book and section material hindered his effectiveness but that can happen.  Dr. Camberos was a fantastic instructor, even though I am not personally a fan of his teaching style. He is very clearly invested in being a teacher, as someone who very rarely takes a break from instructing. I personally would like more examples as opposed to conceptual, however I do understand he generally teaches graduate level, so it makes sense he would focus a lot on concepts.",2017 Summer

He connected with the students more than other professors I have had in the past.  yes  Professor Camberos is hands down awesome, he is in my top 5 favorite professors. What I liked the most about Camberos teaching style is he also discussed the history side of fluid dynamics which I feel is equal important as the material.  yes  Consistently identified class strengths and weakness- it was obvious that he was reviewing the homework/exams with an eye toward progressing student comprehension.  he give's us many example in class and in hw.  Yes  Yes. He understood undergraduates and wanted us to understand the topics as best we could. He explained fluid dynamics in the most practical and approachable way.  Yes, the instructor did demonstrate an interest in my learning.  He encouraged students to ask questions not only about the content, but also about real world scenarios in which this content applied.",2017 Summer
264,ME 3350,Jose Camberos,Question 5,easy to communicate with  very well  Very well  Very effective. He used email and said we could text him and let him know when we needed an email answered promptly.  very well  Communication with the professor was not an issue at all.  well  Good  well  Very good- took the time to explain without outright giving answers.  Willing to compare student processes and answers with the correct methods and solutions.  he's provided every where.  He communicated very effectively  inside class.

He followed the slides and had preplanned example problems.  yes  The lectures were 100%!  yes  Yes  yes  Well organized- the book had some shortcomings which he specifically worked to overcome in lecture.  yes  Somewhat  Yes, some of the best lectures I ever had.  Yes, the course content and lectures were well organized.  The course content and lectures were organized but didn't flow well for a multitude of reasons. One reason was that the book had omitted sections which made solving example problems difficult. Another reason was that the lecture power points were not his own work. He had borrowed them from a fellow professor that usually teaches this class and his teaching style didn't flow with the power point at times.  They were very well structured and he tried his best to hold to the schedule laid out at the beginning of the semester.",2017 Summer

I would be willing to take another course from Professor Camberos in the future.

Lectures were helpful in providing required knowledge though it would have been helpful to have more in class examples to demonstrate how to complete the homework  I consider Dr. Menart the best professor in the Mechanical Engineering program.

273,ME 7350,James Menart,Question 6,"yes until the last day, that was messy  Yes. To the best standard.  yes  Yes.  Granted this was the first time the course has been taught in probably at least 7 years, there were a few bumps along the way but the is to be expected for any class in this situation.  If any errors were made, Dr. Menart was sure to go back and correct them to ensure students had accurate information.  I think more time on the RHT may be beneficial (for example how we essentially used the Navier-Stokes equation throughout the entire semester of convective heat and mass transfer).  Other than that, coming up with more unique symbols for variables may be a good thing.  It was discussed that there are a large number of variables and sometimes symbols get repeated, even in the textbook.  For example, F is used for blackbody fractions and view factor both,  E was used for emissive power and a different term in the scattering and absorption coefficients for the RHT.  There are multiple other cases.  While you can eventually tell what the symbol means from the equation/context, I think its easier for students who are just learning the material if they have unique values.  Other than that this was a good course.  Good  yes  Yes it was well organized.  yes  Well organized  yes",2017 Summer

Helpful and good  The instructor did a good job going through examples of topics.  very good  He was very topic based, and was overall a great teacher. He made sure everybody was on task, and doing their work for the day whether that was doing that day's assignments or working on projects.  Very good at explaining new skills and helping us to adapt to old ones in good ways.  great enthusiasm with students very descriptive  and brings a lot of energy to class. Best instructor I've had thus far.  He was very helpful, although sometimes fast, he always gave time for those who didn't understand to catch up. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and explains it well with examples.  He was a good instructor, he explained things well. Maybe at times a little to fast, but would help you get back where you needed to be.  good  Very effective, fantastic at conveying information  He was very thorough. He explained the techniques well and went over them multiple times to ensure the students' understanding, Some of the drawings we received as reference didn't always have needed dimensions, but we were able to figure them out.

283,ME 1040,Craig Baudendistel,Question 8,"Amazing teacher, hope to have for future courses.  I would recommend this class under Dr. Baudendistel to anyone who has an interest in the material. Fantastic instructor!  Loads a lot of work on at a time.  no  My only suggestion is to be less lenient on the students. As a student who always submits quality work on time and completely, it's irritating to see other students get leeway when they aren't careful about their work or submissions. You defined due dates and the required material very clearly and you shouldn't give out passes because students refuse to read thoroughly. Additionally, if they weren't sure what you wanted, they should contact you. Also, the practical portion of the first exam was way more work than could have reasonably been completed. I find it ridiculous and a little insulting that one of the UTA graders said they completed it in 40 minutes. Maybe make it more clear that you uploaded previous exam material for student to study. Thanks for a great semester!  Give him an award !  he was an amazing teacher and was a lot of fun to have  Just a really great professor and very easy to learn from and to understand all the topics he was teaching.  No  Overall, he was a smart, neat, and nice guy who taught us relevant information for our majors.  No  very professional enjoyed the class  none.  no  Excellent Instructor, that I went out of my way to get for the Spring 2018 semester  Dr. B is an exceptional professor. He was very kind and understanding when many of the students were struggling to learn Solidworks at the start of the semester. Although he does not know everything about Solidworks, he took great lengths to learn more about the program to pass more techniques on to us. Overall, great professor, very involved, and I will definitely recommend him to anyone considering taking his class.  He assigns ridiculous amounts of work, and students to do have the skills to complete it.",2017 Fall
284,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 1,"The instructor is very effective at teaching this class.  The material was taught well and was effectively taught. The class taught some really good applications for use within the field.  He was good at explaining things, but the class time was very short and the lecture type discussions we had were done while everyone was standing and not many notes were able to be taken. Other than the limited class time, the instructor did a good job at answering and responding to questions, and was prompt about refilling supplies as they were depleted.  Very effective and engaging when explaining lab methods and safety  Dr. Young is an excellent instructor, covering what needs to be done clearly and concisely, and explaining in depth why the students are taking the actions they need to take.  He is a great teacher who understands what he is doing. His ability to explain engineering concepts is quite impressive.  Very good. Explained what was necessary for the labs.  Very good at teaching the material and providing good insight into the theory, (helped a lot with ME2700!!).  He is a great professor and does a great job explaining what needs to be done.

285,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 2,"Yes, although the class seems like it is the ""red headed stepchild"" of the materials path, and it has not been updated or changed much in a very long time so the labs are a little out-dated or different from what is asked of you.  Well, currently there are no grades whatsoever for any of the work we have completed, so I'm not sure how well the work has been evaluated.  Yes, the syllabus was accurate in explaining the expectations.  yes, grading followed the syllabus  Unable to answer as of yet. We haven't received grades back yet, but I feel confident that he will do so.  Yes  Yes.  Yes  Yes  Yes",2017 Fall
286,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 3,"Yes.  For the most part. He gave us a lot of time in class to work on the labs in class, and anytime that he did use for class was for very good teachings on how to use the machines and or complete the labs.  The class was started on time most of the time, and very rarely used the entire class time.  no, but this was due to the lab nature of the class so it was still very effective; we could use extra class time for lab work  Class time was somewhat amorphous, due to being a rather free-form lab class on our own schedules. If he needed to cover topics with us, he would take the time in the scheduled time slot to speak with the class. Otherwise, the time was ours to work as we needed to in the lab.  Yes  Not always. We often got time to work on our labs. Typical class time was about an hour.  Yes  Yes, he made use of all the time  Yes",2017 Fall

He made sure we knew what we were doing and answered all of our questions well.  consistently asking if we had questions about labs, giving thorough explanations, was very available through email or in his office  Dr. Young would would explain the what and why of the labs, and was more than willing to answer questions. He would occasionally ask how things were going if we ran into each other in the lab during the week.  He demonstrated passion and humor to the class and was always happy to help for the sake of our learning.  He would help whenever he could and often offered advice as how to accomplish a certain aspect of the lab.  Showing us the results of the lab and what we could expect.  Good incentive/motivation for doing the labs as best as possible.  he was very interested in what we needed help with and was always there to answer questions. He always gave clear and concise instructions.  Yes",2017 Fall
288,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 5,"The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom.  Very well! He responded to emails fairly quickly and when he was in office he would respond to any questions.  In the classroom the communication was very good. Out of class, his communication was not as fast as it was in the classroom, but that is to be expected.  very effective communication both through email and in class  Classroom communication was clear, concise, and efficient. Outside of class didn't need to happen that much, but a mass email got what he needed to say across just fine.  Very well  Very well in the classroom. Email would take him some time to respond back. But when he did, the answers were very helpful.  Good both in and out.  He did a very good job explaining what he wanted from us and what he expected the final outcome to be. He was always willing to answer questions and responds promptly to emails.  Very Well",2017 Fall
289,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 6,"The course outline and ""lectures"" were fine, but not exactly what is in the syllabus or in the labs.  I believe this is due to the class never having enough time to actually do all of the labs, so they usually omit one, which leads to confusion when this professor decides to do the last two at the same time.  Somewhat, some times he was scattered throughout, but it wasn't always.  Not really, but they were not hard to follow either. The classes were more of a on-the-go environment, talking about things and issues as they came about.  for the most part; however the first two labs seemed to take way too long and the last two were rushed. The first lab understandably took longer because there were more new things to learn, but we did not need as much time for the second lab as we were given and it ended up rushing the last two labs quite a bit.  Organization was rather freeform, as the course is mostly student-driven in that the instructor gives the project requirements, explains how you might fulfill them, and then turns the students loose to actually do the work. Whenever there was something that needed to be lectured, though, Dr. Young knew what needed to be said.  There was no lecture, but rather an open lab.  Yes.  Yes  yes  Yes",2017 Fall
290,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 7,"Yes/  Yes.  Yes, in my experiences he was  yes  Dr Young was hard to get a hold of in person, as he had his own work he was doing most of the time. He was quick to respond to emails, though, with one time in which he responded to an email within an hour and a half on a Sunday night in the middle of the Thanksgiving Break.  Yes  Yes.  Yes  yes, he was usually in his office and was always willing and happy to help us if problems arose.  yes",2017 Fall
291,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 8,"While I understand that experience doing all 4 labs as well as doing the ""fun"" lab, #4, to assign both at the same time with only two weeks left in class, or two class periods total, as well as the large reports that are due with them, seemed very rushed.  Neither lab got the attention it probably deserved and the results of both could have been more in depth if they were done separately. Doing an additional lab, which requires a lot of polishing and mounting and microscopy is not ""fun"" when you also have another huge project due at the same time.  Dr. Young was an excellent instructor and I enjoyed the course very much.  I really enjoyed the class, however it was a lot of outside work and consumed a lot of my time during the week in order to keep up with all the work. I think that for a 1 credit hour class, it was a little too much work, and think it wouldn't be a bad idea to increase the amount of hours the class was worth. Also, the labs weren't very well spread out as we have both two lab reports as well as a lab due for this class for finals week alone. Otherwise, the class was very enjoyable.  Overall this was an extremely helpful class as far as reinforcing learning concepts from ME2700 and learning new lab techniques to put on a resume. However, the end of the semester was very stressful since grades for the first two labs were still not available for review up til the last week of the lecture, and 60% of the total grade was due during finals week. It would be very helpful to get the first lab report back, graded and with comments, before the second lab writeup is due so that we could know how well we were doing with our lab report writing. It would also be helpful for the pacing to be a little more even.  An excellent professor, and a pleasure to work with. I hope that we might be able to work together once again in the future.  He is an awesome teacher who does an amazing job. We all had a great semester with him.  The professor is great, this is a great class, but it's not worth one credit hour. The amount of work we have to do outside of class is not worth the one credit hour. It should be, at minimum, two credit hours as we are to do so much of the labs outside of class.  no",2017 Fall
292,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 1,"Very effective  For his first time teaching this course in a while, I would say it went well.  This professor did well in trying to explain material and using up the entire class period. However, most of the classes seemed to involve derivations instead of how to apply the concepts to real world problems or example problems. Therefore, a lot of his classes seemed more confusing than helpful. Furthermore, he did not seem prepared for lectures sometimes, that were shown by making math errors consistently throughout the semester. Overall, he is a good instructor and willing to help.  well  Dr. Young is a very good instructor. He presents the theory in a way that students will understand, and provides example problems to reinforce the theory. The only complaint is how scatter-brained his lectures can get.  Not very effective. Always messed up on examples and spent too much time fixing them in class.  Mildly effective  10/10  excellent  Very effective instructor! Teaches clearly and thoroughly.  Dr. Young was a good professor but he has some flaws that affect his effectiveness in the classroom. I will go into more details about these flaws in other sections of this evaluation.  Decent instructor overall, covers a good balance between theory and examples of the information.  Overall, he gave a good explanation of the subject and worked to answer any questions students had. He even would remember to talk about it the next class if he didn't know the answer that class.  good  Henry Young is somewhat effective. The reason I say somewhat is because he get the theory and the example problems on the board wrong so things just get even more confusing. I give him the benefit of the doubt since he has not taught this class for a while. He truly does care about his students though.  Half the time he was pretty effective and the other half he even seemed confused by what he was saying  Dr. Young's teaching style meshed with how I learn best, so in that sense he was an effective instructor. The balance of theory and example problems was good enough for me.  Not very effective  Professor has a good heart and bless it, he tries.  He tries to do examples and things in class to get his point across.  The problem is, he is SO unorganized.  He loses his place, makes many errors in front of the class, has to stand there for many minutes at a time trying to regroup himself and figure out where he is.   But hey, he hasn't given up and he usually tries to clear up his mistakes.  Fair grader.  Very good professor, we all enjoyed the class.  Works out problems that you would actually see on exams in class.  The instructor is very effective at teaching mechanics of materials, and shows a large interest in the subject as well as teaching it.  The instructor presented the content clearly, defined and explained the theory well and gave ample relevant examples. However there were some occasions where the lectures moved too slowly. Overall quite effective.  Very scatter-brained.  He was very effective in the class.  He was a pretty good professor overall. Probably 3.5/5, would not mind taking again.  Although a bit unorganized at times, he explains things very well and the train of thought can be very easy to follow.  I enjoyed Dr. Young's teaching. He always taught with energy and I think that it made the material more enjoyable. He did make mistakes in his math sometimes but he always worked to correct them.  Somewhat effective. He gave good examples in class and was always willing to answer questions, but he frequently seemed unprepared for the lecture. A few times it seemed like he'd never looked at the notes for that day.  The teacher really cares about the students and them comprehending the material. With that being said, the teacher sometimes gets off track in his own work and makes many mistakes while doing problems on the board, he does catch and fix them and gives you great feedback on what he expects from you as a student in his class  Dr. Young was fairly effective. The lectures were sometimes confusing because he said he hadn't taught the class in a while. At one point we spent two lectures on one problem because he wasn't sure of his notes. I'm not saying it was terrible at all, but a lot of us were confused frequently.  Dr. Young was very effective in class; he explained everything thoroughly throughout the semester. He often made mistakes during lecture, but these errors had little to no effect on my understanding of the course material, and he was able to correct himself most of the time.  Dr. Young was fairly effective. I thought he spent too much time working through the theory and derivation of equations making it less effective.  He is a decent professor, pretty laid back  Clear in his speech. Can be scrambled or appear jumbled when solving a problem.  Dr. Young is a very effective instructor. He explains things very well and helps anyone who has questions.  Very effective  great  Pretty effective  Good teacher willing to help students out even when he makes mistakes.  At the beginning of the class, he seemed well put together and organized. He got to the point and taught well. At the end of the semester; however, he was very disorganized, and his lessons are filled with mistakes and errors. This results in standardized equations being copied down incorrectly by students.  Was not very effective for this course. I have heard he is better at other courses.  Sometimes a bit messy, but always tries his best to make everything clear and understandable for every student.",2017 Fall
293,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 2,"Yes  Do not spring a project on students that is not explicitly mentioned in the syllabus. I know it falls under in class activities, but with the other workload from classes, adding something like that at the end of the semester without mentioning it prior is not appropriate. It was a good activity, but I think it should have been mentioned more in depth earlier on. Students have a lot of other work.  Yes, the professor graded us by all of the standards listed in the syllabus. He gave us deadlines and dates for all of the projects, exams and homework.  yes  Yes  yes.  Somewhat. A group project was given for the last two weeks of class, without being told in advance. There was a unused 10% of the grade in the syllabus listed as ""in-class activities and quizzes"" which we were never given. This 10% was used for the surprise group project. This project was also in assigned groups, making it very hard to coordinate with group members during the busiest time of the semester when insufficient class time was given to complete this project. Of the two project choices, the content of one was being taught until the second to last class, leaving the students with insufficient knowledge of the subject for in class group work time.  10/10  yes  Yes.  Yes, he was straightforward in his expectations in his syllabus and he graded based on that.  Yes, very fair and honest instructor. More professors should follow his example.  Yes he did.  yes  Yes he did.  Yes for the most part, however he did say at the beginning of the semester he would give out about 5 pop quizzes throughout the semester and never ended up doing so. Instead he decided to have us do a group project within the last few weeks of the semester. I would’ve rather he been upfront about what we would be graded on so I could’ve planned accordingly.  Yes, work was evaluated as expected.  Yes  yes.  yes  Yes.  Yes, the instructor does a very good job of evaluating  your work based on the expectations he lays out.  Yes, instructor closely followed syllabus with small alterations based to keep pace with the semester.  Yes, mostly. The in-class activity was thrown in right at the end of the semester.  yes  I don't have a huge problem with his grading. Exam problems seemed to be graded a little too harshly, but the curves and easy homework points helped make up for it.  Grading criteria was clear throughout the class.  Yes  yes  yes  Yes.  For the most part; however, at the beginning of the semester, we were told that we would be graded on our attendance by having random pop quizzes. He never gave us a single quiz in class. To make up for this, he decided to give us an in-class group design project which would take place of the attendance grade. He did not tell us about this project until mid-November. We were supposed to get 30 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays to work on this assignment, but almost every time we would only be given about 10-15 minutes. Along with this, he did not teach us the material that was needed for this project until about a week and a half before it was due. This gave us only two (partial) class periods to actually work on the project. As a result, most of this last minute ""in-class"" project had to be done outside of class.  Yes, Dr. Young followed the course syllabus exactly.  Yes he did  Yes, fair evaluator.  Yes.  Yes  yes  Yes  Yes  Yes, the only complaint I have is the lack of explanation of the grades on the midterms. On several problems the only explanation was because he took off that many points for everyone.  Yes - there were no surprises. Dr. Young was very clear with his course expectations.  Exams were rough and graded inconsistently in my opinion.  Although the Syllabus is short, you always know what the next lesson will be about.",2017 Fall
294,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 3,"Yes  Yes.  The professor always started class on time and used the entire class period. At some points he would go five minutes over, which caused conflict with the class following us. However, he consistently utilized the who period for lecture or class activities.  yes  Yes  always on time and always used every minute of class.  Yes  10/10  yes  Yes  Yes. We actually needed more time to learn all the material, but Mr. Young was able to teach everything needed in the time allotted.  Class always started on time and we would use the entire class period. Sometimes we would run over a few minutes so that we could finish a problem that we were working on.  Yes.  Class always started on time and ended on time.  yes  Yes, we always started on time and there were a couple of times we left a little early but nothing to worry about.  Yes  Yes.  Yes  yes.  yes  Always from start to end.  Yes, the instructor is very punctual.  Yes.  yes  yes  yep  Instructor was always on timed and partitioned classes well.

Yes, he would most times use more than the allotted time in class  Yes  Yes.  Yes almost every class  yes  Yes  Yes  He used the whole class period, but often didn't finish the lesson. He would have to go over and fix the problems from the prior day.  Yes  Yes  Yes, only once or twice a few minutes late.",2017 Fall
295,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 4,"Dr. Young is very cordial and receptive to questions. He is fair and takes feedback to heart. He even changed the date of a midterm for our class because we voiced that we had several in the same week as his.  He answered questions readily, and encouraged thinking.  The instructor demonstrated interest by frequently asking if we had questions about the material. He would stop class to answer any questions and help people in understanding the material covered.  yes  Dr. Young made sure every student understood the theory/example being discussed, and made sure to provide each question asked a suitable answer.  Was very open to questions and concerned about our understanding.  Made sure the class understood the content by asking questions, explaining pieces of the lecture again, etc.  10/10 Related real world applications to what we were learning  did good job  Yes, Mr. Young shows a genuine enthusiasm for Materials Engineering and teaching it.  He was very interested in this topic and it reflected in his teaching. He also related everything to real world scenarios so that we would have a better understanding of the topic.  Yes  How he taught the class showed that he had an interest in the class. He was always passionate about the subject and his students.  yes  He would research a question that someone asked in class if he did not know it and made sure that he would answer that students question correctly the next class day.  Questions were answered thoroughly. More time was spent on topics considered difficult. Topics the class struggled with were gone over in greater detail, including exam debriefs.  He answered all questions  yes.  yes  Would always stop teaching to help someone with a question, very helpful.  Yes, the instructor is very passionate about the subject and its impact on your future, and also the learning of his students.  Yes. Instructor check numerous times to make sure class was following and answer all questions.  he did not  yes  Always attempted to answer all our questions, looked up information that he didn't know for later. Seemed to care well enough.  Henry always kept a good connection with the students in and out of class.  Dr. Young was always available to talk when he was in his office, even if it wasn't during office hours. That alone made him one of the best teachers I've ever had.  He was very willing and interested in answering questions regardless of the complexity. He was very effective at explaining concepts as well.  was always available, answered every question asked  He made sure that if we had a question, he'd have an answer by the end of lecture or by the next lecture.  He made sure everyone understood the material by answering the many questions that were asked in class to the best of his ability.  Dr. Young would allow adequate time for questions throughout lecture and would stop lecture if a question came up that needed further explanation.  He demonstrated good interest  Was very enthusiastic when answering questions and if he was unable to answer at first, he went back and figured out the problem and made sure we had an answer.  He was excited to teach us and he was excited when he saw that we were learning. Showed that he actually cared about the education of his students.  Actively answering questions and trying to engage the class  coming prepared to class everyday  Very passionate teaching  He gave examples related to the course textbook and briefly explained the concept before explaining how to solve the problem.  Dr. Young was always willing to answer questions, and encouraged them.  Interested in our learning, but lectures were more theoretical than concrete and exams were concrete  I could always ask him if I had a question. (In the lesson and afterwards as well)",2017 Fall
296,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 5,"Very effectively.  Very effectively.  The teacher responded back to any email that I sent within a day's time. He was helpful in answering questions after class too. However, the one time that I attempted to go to his office hours, he was not in his room.  well  Dr. Young was very clear in his expectations both in and out of the classroom.  Very effectively.  Well  10/10  effective and good enough  He always answers any questions in and out of class  Very well.  Communication outside of the classroom was great. He was always available in his office and through email. However, in the class, communication was a little off. He would be asked a question and sometimes he would answer it fine and other times he would try to answer a question and would end up confusing us more in the end.  Well.  Communication was always good in and out of class.  good  He communicated well in and outside of class.  He seemed lost a lot of the time and tended to get fairly flustered if there was a question asked. He also said that a certain kind of problem was going to be asked on our exam which was never asked so that might’ve thrown a bunch of people off if they were studying that specific problem for a large chunk of time.  Effective communication all around.  Very well  he is always willing to help. Communicates well in and out of class.  very good  NA.  The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom.  Quite.  Fine. Was late uploading documents that were promised in class.  Very well. He would send emails regarding homework or class.  Generally, I understood the points that he was trying to get across to the class.  well.

297,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 6,"Yes  Not all the time, but again, for the first time teaching it in a few years, I think kinks always need to be worked out.  The class and content were decently organized. The instructor had material to go over but sometimes the professor seemed unorganized. For some classes he would make many mathematical mistakes that would carry over many class periods and cause confusion. Overall, the professor could improve a little on his organization of his material and what he is teaching. With this he would save class time and confuse students less.  lecture could have been slightly more organized  The course content was very well organized. The lectures were well organized.  Very well organized  Somewhat. Wasn't very prepared for class. Often times didn't understand own lecture notes or would incorrectly copy information from notes to board. Wasted time and made lectures confusing.  8/10 Sometimes lectures were a little all over the place or had a few continuity errors. Other than that the lectures were good  yes  No  Yes, but really more time is needed to go over the material better.  Here is where his flaws are. I do not feel like the lecture was well organized. There were some lectures where he was very scatterbrained and we would spend an entire class working one problem and not even finish it because he would constantly make mistakes. I would not be so upset about the mistakes if it wasn't for the fact that he had the solutions in his hand and still made a lot of mistakes. Some of the mistakes he wouldn't catch until he was at the end of the problem and his calculations wouldn't be matching up. There was one week we spent all 3 days of class going over one problem because he would continually make mistakes. I really wish he would have uploaded his lectures on pilot so that maybe we could have followed along with his and possibly catch his mistakes as he makes them.  Somewhat, others were more or less so. The more prepared he came the better the class was.  Yes, everything was well organized.  yes  For the most part. I did not care that it took two classes just to solve one problem. I would have also liked to see a little less theory and more examples. The class was about 65% theory and 35% problems.  Course content was well organized on pilot. Lectures felt haphazard a lot of the time and not practiced.  The course was well organized throughout the semester. On a day-to-day basis, some lectures seemed underprepared for (maybe 1/5) which could lead to some confusion on my end.  Not very organized  no.  yes  Somewhat, the lectures can vary in organization.  Yes, with the exception of the ""final project"" which was only revealed in the last few weeks of class and seemed very rushed.  Course contact was well organized. The instructors notes may not have. There were a few difficulties and mishaps with working from notes. This was at times distracting and potentially confusing.  not really - seemed to jump around a lot. Wish there was more examples rather than so much theory worked out in class.  yes  He seems a little scatterbrained sometimes. Sometimes struggled to follow his examples from his notes. In this regard, he could have been more prepared for lectures.  very well.  Yes  While the content was organized, the lectures frequently felt all over the place or incredibly confusing. Sometimes, it seemed he hadn't looked at the lecture notes before.  yes  Lectures were at times unorganized and left us confused, but I'd say 85% of the time they were organized.  For the most part. He was a little scatterbrained at times, but overall he did a good job staying on track.  Yes, they were well organized for the most part. Sometimes, Dr. Young would get lost in the solutions or take up three class periods to explain on point when I could read it or find the equation in the book and have a solid understanding of the concept within 30 minutes versus 2h40m.  Yes, and no. Some days it would be organized and other days he would have no idea what was going on  could stand more organization.  Yes.  Yes  yes  Mainly  The content was explained well.  The lectures were explained well but if it were more organized it could have been more understandable.  No they were not.  I found providing multiple ways to solve problems spanning over several days to be a bit confusing - but that's partially due to the short class time.  I also believe that providing the equation first, then describing the theory behind it may be clearer. I personally write every thing down during each lecture- but it may have been more helpful for me to know I have the necessary equation down in my notes, then 'soak in' the theory behind it.  Lectures were very unorganized for this course. Would spend several classes on derivations of equations provided in the book and not enough example problems worked through.  it was ok.",2017 Fall
298,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 7,"Yes  Yes, he was, even for questions that did not pertain to his class.  The only time that I tried to visit the professor in his office hours, he was not in his room.

299,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 8,"No. Maybe. No time.  Overall, he is a good professor, but he could work on organization of the class and what will be covered on the exams. There were many questions on expectations for exams, therefore, it would be more helpful if he covered more examples and informed the class what topics to review.  no  No  Good teacher. Okay class. Lectures always felt rushed and there weren't a variety of examples problems. Usually only had time for one of each type of problem.  Doctor Young is overall a really good professor. He does a really good job of explaining the material and knows his stuff. The homework and exams can be difficult but reasonable. I would take this professor again for other classes as well, given the chance to. Good Job Doctor Young!  No  Perhaps with more time and without a student who continually interrupts the class. But these are things against the class and not the instructor.  Please post lecture material on pilot. It would have helped out greatly I believe.  Good instructor overall.  He was a really good professor, but he can lose his train of thought easy. If a student asks a question, sometimes it felt like he got completely lost in class. He would rebound in a couple minutes, but it just make class a little disconnected.  good  Prof Young should write a little bigger on the board and stick to black marker. Also it might be beneficial to run through lectures ahead of time so they are more polished and prepared.  I enjoyed this course, its content and the instructor.  I enjoyed the class and the professor made that huge difference. I think the one major thing challenging Dr. Young is time. This is not a 50 min class kind of course. He is so thorough that we could only do one question each class. If class is only going to be 50 min. long, Dr. Young cannot completely convey the entire subject.  Good professor, I recommend.  The instructor teaches the class very well, but i do not think this class should be taught in 3 separate 55 minute lectures a week, because that is barely enough time to cover one concept or one problem, and on multiple occasions was not enough time to even finish a problem.  Well run class, enjoyable, good teaching skills.  The class project was started at a good time but the half classes at a time seemed less convenient then setting a class per week aside for the project. Also I was not aware there was a project till it started.  no  nope  Use the digital pen instead of board, it would simplify things  I hope I can take another class with Dr. Young!  I'd say for our final project, it may need to be changed to content that we have learned up until the date of assignment. We had a week left of in-class time to work and had just learned the material we needed to solve the project.  No  Work more problems. Don't dwell so much on the theory, when Dr. Young could just provide the equation and then walk through how to apply the equation within a problem. I think that'd helped students far more than the theory does. If the students need more explanation, then refer them to the book. Otherwise, Dr. Young was a good instructor and I enjoyed the class and have a better understanding of the structures around me.  Questions on exams were way too tricky to the point where individuals with Master degrees in engineering got them incorrect.  No  no  Good professor  No  I know this is probably more department related topic, but this class should last much longer than 55 minutes. It's very hard to grasp a concept when examples have to be split over several days due to the time constraint. I think a 2+ hour class would be beneficial to many.  I feel as though he may have been over burdened by needing to teach this course due to budget cuts. But there also wasn't much structure to his lectures which was a detriment to myself. He curved exams rather fairly when he knew he made the exams too difficult for the time allotted to take them.  Returning of homework can take a very long time.  He helped me a lot in the beginning to be able to participate in his class.",2017 Fall

Difficult tests and does't even teach the material just does problems over it. Really needs to change his teaching style.  The instructors enthusiasm really helps with learning something that otherwise is very dry  the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well  Pretty good.  Loved this course because of how fun he made it.  Good  Scott Thomas is a very good professor overall.  He was a little bit odd at times, but not in a bad way.

The way he teaches is phenomenal, and I can't wait to take more of his classes.  Dr Thomas did a great job conveying the content.

I wish Physics majors were required to take this class, I only took it as an elective to fill in my schedule to full time senior year.

Great professor I love that he relates what you are learning to the real world so you have a feel of how what you are learning is important.  No, Thank you  Nope.  None. Thank you so much for a GREAT semester!  No  no  His policy on homework is ""no later than when the dropbox is due"" and that's it, regardless of whatever excuse you may have. While this isn't uncommon in colleges, it has no place in this class. On a number of occasions I was unable to turn in homework due to some bizarre Matlab error on my computer; it would crash when I would try to publish my code as a .pdf, and because of this I would have nothing to turn into the Dropbox. Thomas would not hear what was wrong with my computer, and refused to acknowledge my work despite knowing full well that I had completed the assignment before the deadline.  no  I would like to thank him for a wonderful semester.  -  Dr. Thomas is an amazing instructor who is extremely passionate about what he does. While he is in some ways a ""hard"" teacher because he follows the syllabus exactly with 0 deviations, at least you always know what to expect. I very much enjoyed him as an instructor and would love to have him for other classes.  Scott did a great job. Very likeable.  Great guy, bad at teaching Matlab. Goes on even if the class isn't understanding the topic  4.9 out of 5 stars would definitely take him again.

Can tell that he wants the student to learn always excited to teach in class.  yes  Scott Thomas overall is a very effective teacher. He takes the time to care about his students and really helps you apply the subject to real world context.  Very effective  Very effective  Scott is a fantastic instructor.  I have had Dr. Thomas for 2 classes now and have learned so much.  Scott is always on time and makes class fun and enjoyable.  I think he gives plenty of resources that allow for anyone to succeed in this class. I enjoyed the lectures because he is a funny guy, but is also effective in his teaching.  very effective  I took him for a previous class and i still believe he is one of the best professors here at wright state university  He is very understanding and knows the material very well.  10/10 Great Professor  You will not find a more effect professor at this University, or maybe even the state of Ohio. Dr. Thomas is fantastic.  Overall, I had a good experience in Statics. I'm doing fairly well in the course (about a low A). I think you do a great job with answering questions in class, but I think you should focus your lectures more on the concepts of statics and I think you should spend some time linking the physics behind statics to the example problems from the lecture. Often times, when I would get to a big end of chapter problem I had issues linking that back to physics concepts. Also, I like your optimism in the classroom. It keeps me focused on an inherently boring topic. However, I did feel distracted by a lot of the joking in lecture. I mean it's fun and all, but let's keep a positive attitude and focus on the subject. I did enjoy this semester though!  Dr. Thomas was one of the best professors I have ever had. He was very good at teaching the material and worked hard to ensure all students understood the material.  Very effective.  Dr. Thomas is an absolutely fantastic professor! One of the best at Wright State. He is extremely effective. He makes sure all of his students know what is going on and is willing to help them in any way possible.  Dr. Thomas was really engaging and he made sure every one of his students understood,.  He was a very good teacher.  His teaching technique was very beneficial to me since I am a person who learns by example.

He is a very awesome professor. He told us on the very first day that one of his most important words for the class is ""Fair."" He makes sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. He cares about the students and makes class fun.  Great teacher, he is probably one of the best engineering professors in this school. He is an amazing professor who genuinely cares. I do believe on one of the exams he expected a little too much i felt there was not a lot of time and the majority of the class did not finish or turn in their exams but think this is not his fault since the class length got cut in half from his previous classes he is still adjusting. I learned a lot and enjoyed his class very much. The course was challenging but was manageable with how well Scott was able to teach the class.  This professor did a good job at teaching however his lectures were always a bit rushed and at times hard to follow.  instructor was great! very effective at teaching the material and kept class fun and entertaining  He is a great professor when it comes to teaching.

He is prepared to answer any question and is willing to do whatever is necessary to help a student with their understanding.  Very good, used lots of examples. Sometimes the examples ran together and became a little monotonous but I also have a short attention span.  Scott Thomas is an amazing professor who truly cares for his students.  Scott Thomas was incredibly effective as a teacher.  A lot of my best teachers were the ones that gave numerous examples, and he is no exception.  He used a lot of examples, encouraged class questions, participation, and even allowed us, when we were confused about a methodology, to talk it out to him and each other in class, and he would help us figure it out.  He also was a fun teacher to have and created a positive learning environment.  He is a very engaging instructor and made the classroom have a very friendly environment.  very effective",2017 Fall

With that being said, I believe most questions got answered in class. He made it a specific point to make sure everyone in the class was comfortable asking questions which really stood out to me.  Keeping a positive attitude and making us feel comfortable asking questions. A lot of times in the science and engineering courses, professors can cultivate an esoteric atmosphere, which is harmful to students. That is not evident here! I felt comfortable asking questions.  Dr. Thomas made the class fun! He peaked students learning by making the class interesting, and also communicated with the students in class.  Probed is to ask relevant questions and often brought up topics related to the subject that are relevant to our field.  Dr. Thomas cares about every single one of his students. He will not move on in class unless every single person is understanding what is going on. He also will pause during the process of explaining material and ask the students if anyone has questions or will make up his own questions he thinks will help us understand the material.  Every 5 minutes or so he would stop to answer questions and he takes time to answer every question asked by students.  I liked his class.  He treated every question and concern the same way, no matter how good of a question it may have been, and made sure that everyone was on the same page before he moved on to the next step or problem.  Dr. Thomas will routinely pause during the lecture and ask if anybody has any questions.  This helps to keep everybody on the same page during the lecture.  He made sure class was fair. He provided all the homework questions on separate handouts and gave solutions to every question on those handouts. He provided every previous exam he had given and the solutions.  He would respond to emails and questions quickly and to the best of his ability.  was very willing to spend extra time on individual students questions or to meet outside of class to answer them  He made it super easy and when I had questions he answred them really well for me to understand.

Scott is very open and will answer all questions to the best of his ability.  Very well.  very effective  He was very effective with communicating. whether it be questions or concerns about the class.  emails contained necessary knowledge  Very Well  Incredibly well, email response time was usually within the hour.  Fine. Not an issue.  Dr. Thomas emailed me back very quickly when I had a question, and offered to help me during office hours when ever I could attend.  Very well  Dr. Thomas is always available though email or stopping by his office hours.  He answered questions and had very flexible office hours.  He was a good responder.  His in class communication was very good, and I did not contact him out of class at all so I can not judge that. However, he did email us after each midterm as soon as he had finished grading the test to let us know the grades were in, which I thought was very helpful.  The instructor communicated effectively inside and outside the classroom.  He communicated very well throughout the semester both in and out of class.  He communicated well but as stated earlier, he seems to always be rushed which sometimes makes it difficult to understand material he teaches.  very effectively. answered emails promptly and was very helpful  Amazing in the class he was super great. The issue that I had is in his office hours, there were lots of people there and also he flies through what u needed help with. I felt like the office hours were useless.  Communication is often clear, and he is more than willing to clarify any confusions.  Expectations were always very clear.  Communicated via email for upcoming tests and reminded us of homework assignments the beginning of every class and reviewed where we were at according to syllabus.

313,ME 2120,Scott Thomas,Question 6,"yes  yup  The lectures were well organized and the content went in sequential order of the book.  very well organized  Yes  For the most part, sometimes he would not write the intermediate math steps which left me confused on occasion.  Yes, he always knew what he was teaching and it was also available on the syllabus.  yes  Yes they are always very organized  yes  Yes  Very, everything you could ever need is online.  Like I said before, I would try to incorporate the physics concepts into the example problems of the lecture more, or make them more evident. If that makes sense? Like every time we would cover a new ""concept"" it would take two seconds to lecture about it and then we would go do problems. THIS IS OKAY, BUT I feel like it would've been better if you highlighted the concepts more instead of burying ourselves in example problems (that's what the homework is for!  Yes, every class he walked into he had a plan for.  Yes, he knew what he doing each and every day.  The content and lectures are extremely organized. It feels like Dr. Thomas has every single thing we do planned out in advance, which maximizes our learning.  Yes.  Yes he was well organized.  Yes, he had a clear set of lesson plans that flowed well between each class, and the homework problems were all similar to the problems we did together in class.  Yes.  They were very organized.  He is very organized. He lectures over theory and then gives examples for each chapter.  yes  They were very organized, everything was perfectly planned. Didn’t had an issue with that. He made everything interesting to learn. The issue that I had was the exams are worth 90% of the overall grade.

315,ME 2120,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"I think his exams are too much of the grade....especially if there gonna be as hard as he makes them. I think maybe he should add a course project or something instead of exams being 90% of the grade  very well spoken teacher respects any and all questions no matter how dumb of a question. Best teacher hopefully able to take more classes with this professor in the future.  N/a  Second time around taking this class and I really like his teaching style.  No  Scott is a fantastic professor and a great person.  I have thoroughly enjoyed being in his class.  He was a great instructor for this course.  professor of the year award goes to him! Every year!  Great professor and one of the nicest guys on campus  I feel bad for the students who didn't have the opportunity to take Dr. Thomas this semester. I really do.  Overall, a good experience. If anything, I would say you need to push your students a little more. I know for example that I had a habit of just copying down the homework solutions from the website. I know it's not your job to make us take the initiative, but when all of the students taking this class are about in their second year of classes and taking 18 credit hours of hard math and core courses, this class can become less of a priority, WHICH SHOULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE ME CLASS. I know that's not your fault, but overall your students might get something more if there were more intermediate examinations, like in class quizzes or something to kind of force us to study. At any rate, thanks for teaching this semester!  Dr. Thomas was probably one of my favorite professors. He was fair, helpful, affective at teaching the material, and I would recommend/sign up for any other class he taught.  Dr. Thomas is my favorite professor on Wright State's campus. It warms my heart to know that some professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed. I will be taking classes with Dr. Thomas every time my schedule allows it.  Dr. Thomas has a good system of teaching and is a wonderful teacher.  He was a great teacher  Thank you for making Statics enjoyable, and I hope that I can take another class of yours before I graduate. -Lucas S.  He is a great professor.  We need more professors like this.  I think professor Thomas truly cares about his students learning and is a passionate professor.  Dr. Thomas is a great Professor  Overall the class is grade, but he need to make the grading much easier. He is killing me when it comes to grading. 90% are coming from the exams. Also he is a reallly hard grader as well.  It's been a pleasure. I hope that I'll be able to work with you again in the future.  Scott Thomas is a great professor.  will look for more classes he teaches in the future.  He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He will go out of his way to ensure the students who reach out to him have a full understanding of the content.  If you make the exams worth 20 points but only put two questions on it the chances of the class doing well will be slim. My problem would be that I would get one question right and the other wrong and it would dock me like 10-8 points and suddenly I have a D or F. Its a great class but for people who struggle with physic concepts, its demeaning when you get Ds on most of your exams. Extra credit is amazing but that doesn't reassure you as much. I rather have several little quizzes that are for extra credit but allow the professor to see where we stand in the class.  Overall, I think he taught his class very well and made the class fun.  no",2017 Fall

Could have used that time more effectively  Mr. Thomas was a very effective instructor. I learned so much from him during this class. Mr. Thomas made the material fun and engaging. He would constantly have students participate and encourage them to ask questions. He was very clear on every thing did, if students had any problem with a topic, he would further explain it and let students know where they could find it in the text.

In a class that stresses fairness, the idea that a student that didn't study can simply move the weight to the final really puts students who did study as a disadvantage. Not turning in the blue book skews the average and eliminates any potential for a curve.  It's also evident that difficulty of exam questions are based on the class's exam average. If the exam average is high on exam 1, students can predict there being a much-harder-than-normal problem on exam 2. It doesn't help that students not turning in a blue book can influence the next exam by skewing test averages. Not entirely fair, Dr. Thomas. Other than that, Dr. Thomas should teach a class about teaching, teach it in his style, and WSU needs to force all CECS professors to attend it.  Professor Thomas is good with utilizing class time efficiently. He ran through practice problems for most of the class time which I feel is very effective when trying to learn this type of material. The only critique would be that he sort of assumed that everyone was on the same level and covered the same material in Thermo 1 since he taught that as well. So it would’ve been nice if we could’ve reviewed the key concepts in the beginning more thoroughly.  Scott is a great professor and I enjoyed having this course with him. I hope he doesn't change. Probably my favorite teacher.  Dr. Thomas is a great professor and cares deeply for his students making sure they understand the material and have fun learning.  One of the best professors I have had throughout my college career, who actually cares about his students.  I very much enjoyed having him as an instructor and I cannot wait to have him again.  I enjoyed the class and material presented by Scott. He did a great job and kept the classroom involved with humor. I believe that the jokes that Scott told the class help the class pay attention in class.",2017 Fall

Dr. Mian is effective.  good  Was helpful and much improved from last time I had him gave lots of examples.  He is a nice guy.  Dr. Mian was very effective is conveying the information we needed. If there were any questions, he would try his best to provide an answer. Also has a great attitude.

His course and teaching style is easy to follow.  Great  Not very effective, he made a lot of mistakes during lecture which made the subject matter more confusing than it needed to be.  Good guy. He tries to make things clear and makes classes fun. He's not as organized as I wish he were, but he provides most notes online which is helpful. His exams are straightforward and he tailors examples to it. He understands that students have a hard time learning the material and he tries to give credit where he can to help.  He did ok but there was room for improvement. He needed to do problems from start to finish and make sure to have solutions and not get mixed up halfway through the problems. He always did what he thought was the ""hard part"" and let us do the rest on our own. Sometimes this was difficult if we didn't know how to finish the problem.",2017 Fall

He'd even go over sometimes which could be annoying but that showed he cared more about teaching the material than escaping the moment he could.  yes  yes  Yes  Yes.  yes  yes  Yes, we used the full class period. This probably shouldn't be a 3-day, 50 minute course as the material is comprehensive and it doesn't leave much time for example problems following a topic.

Good  Somewhat effectively.  Well.  He did not communicate super well. I talked to him in office hours about a group project and he said to email the details and he would take a look at it. I emailed him and never got a response. I then approached him in class and asked about it. He said he would take a look at it the next day.

I would have preferred a review session on the last day as opposed to guest speakers. The guest speakers were interesting and informative however, they would have been better placed earlier in the schedule so that the last lecture could have been a review.  No  d  I have no idea why I had to take this class. it seems completely useless although the same can be said for many of our required classes the methods used are out dated and this is suppose to prepare us for the reel world though it seems to be preparing us for the job market of 1950.  Excited to take vibrations with Dr. Mian  no  nope  he is the best one  One of the most caring professors I've had.

332,ME 4920,Akm Mian,Question 1,"Not effective  Well informed and available  Professor exhibits poor effectiveness. Offers no substance for the course and often times seems clueless.  He is a great professor.  good  Terrible. This is the fourth semester I've had Mian and the third class. He's an awful professor. Nice guy, I don't have anything against him personally. I've never received a bad grade from him or anything like that. He's just awful. He was often late for class. The first day of Capstone 1 he didn't show up claiming he thought the class started at 7:35pm rather than 7:35am. And this is the man in charge of my education. He was the most unorganized professor I've ever had to deal with, taking 5-10 minutes to set up for class, and keep in mind this was after he was late. Can't teach to save his life. Learned and retained very little information. I had him for Mechanics of Materials and because he didn't teach that very well my Mechanical Design 1 professor had to take time to teach us his material. Had him for System Dynamics and that was the biggest waste of time. The material is worth knowing but I didn't learn any of it thanks to him. Oh but I got a B in the class. He doesn't care if we learn, he just wants to give us the grade and go home.  yes  He did a good job of making sure everyone was on track with their projects.  His being there is pointless.  Reasonably effective  good  very kind professor, good communicated with the students  good  He is a good instructor, but he needs to work on telling the students when deadlines are and when presentations will actually happen. As students, we spent a lot of time in the dark on when things were due and when to pick up notebooks. The times he listed were not always correct and sometimes he forgot to say anything at all. Now that being said, he did acknowledge his mistakes when he made them and tried to correct the ones he could.  Gets off of track very easily.  Very good.  He is so effective  Very good  Dr. Mian was an effective professor throughout this course.  he always available to answer any of the student considerations.

He met with us to discuss project progress  Honestly, I feel like a lot of Capstone doesn't need to be taught in a classroom setting.

We missed or nearly missed a lot of deadlines because either it wasn't on the syllabus or he didn't tell us about them. And while we're on the subject of the syllabus, it might as well not exist.

339,ME 4920,Akm Mian,Question 8,"Dr. Mian is new to teaching capstone. Our class had no idea what was really expected of us and hopefully this has given him the experience needed for his next capstone course.  Dr. Mian is another professor in the ME department that should not be teaching. Every class I have had with him has been a waste of my time and money. As long as he remains teaching core classes, WSU ME students will be cheated out of education and money.  no  Start caring about our education. It will help a lot of students out if he actually taught the material versus whatever it is he does now. Get more organized, please. Again, I've never had any personal issues with Mian.

340,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 1,"The instructor was overall fairly effective, though some explanations could afford to be clearer.  He is a good professor.  explained information in good detail for both the hw and quiz's to be done in a simple matter  He did a good job at making the course content easy to understand, and he also answered questions.  This made the class easy for me.  It was alright.  Great professor - Subject could be taught with great efficiency if it was not a split level course.  Dr. Bae is a good teacher.  I feel like he conveys information very well.  Ha-Rok Bae is not the most effective professor I've had in my college career. Often the only usable notes I have are the example problems we do in class and even then, they are cryptic. Most of the knowledge I gained in the class came from the text and my own personal research.  Dr. Bae was very effective in teaching this class. He provided summary notes, that were very helpful, in addition to showing multiple ways to solve a problem. The only drawback was that the material is very repetitive which leads to some tuning out during lecture. I think some more classworks would have been able to prevent that.  Overall pretty effective. He does this annoying thing where he writes on the board on top of stuff he's already written, and it's very hard to follow. His writing is also not the greatest. If he turned on the lights by the chalkboard it would be easier to see too, but mainly I wish he'd erase the whiteboard.  Very effective instructor. Broke down the material to be extremely simple and understandable.  he is very good at teaching the material. he is very experienced and knowledgeable.  Ha Rok Bae was a very effective instructor.  Dr. Bae taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams.  He tries to explain things thoroughly, which is appreciated, and goes over examples.  He starts class without warning and gets upset that we haven't started listening even though no one realizes he's started. He does not offer his extra credit fairly - he only allowed 10 people extra credit which brings everyone else's extra credit average down. (But at least we get a chance at extra credit) He does not teach towards his exams and its hard to be prepared for his exams because the homework isn't similar to the exam and he keeps changing the structure of his exams so you can never get used to it. He has a very strict partial credit scale that does not allow for ANY mistakes.  Dr. Bae is lazy.  The instructor seemed to know the material very well. One issue was that he used a lot of MATLAB and WOLFRAMATICA in class to solve some of the problems. This was not terrible because we could use them for the homeworks, but they were not available on the exam. This made it difficult to know how to do some of the exam problems by hand because we learned them on software that we couldn't use for the exams.  Dr. Bae is very enthusiastic about the course material and about teaching it to others. He strives to make sure everyone understands the underlying basic principles and general procedures before diving into the theory and derivation of the complex topics covered. Dr. Bae's approachability helped me to grasp the concepts and ask him questions after class when I didn't quite understand something in the textbook or homework.  Not effective in the slightest. Had unreasonable expectations for graduate students compared to undergraduate students.  i  Very Poor  The classes were poorly organized. The lectures were spratic and it was next to impossible to follow his notes on the board. In addition he would have 3 sets of notes on the projector and then jump all around the board with hard to read comments. He would show the problems in matlab and mathmatica and then test us on how to do it by hand which we would not know how to do. He would often go over time and freeze the time on the board in an effort to make us think it was still 9:18. Overall very unimpressed with the class structure and lay out.  Terrible. Learning had to be done via youtube tutorials. Was not available during office hours. Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions.  Very effective with use of plenty of examples and teaching strategies.  Pretty good, I felt I learned a lot on finding the deflection, stress and reaction forces of structures.  Dr.Bae is one of the most effective instructors. He is a knowledgeable person and have an excellent teaching skill.  Finite element analysis is one of the core subject for mechanical designing.  Dr. Bae has taught this course very effectively.  Ease in understanding the subject and demonstrated the subject better. He has given a detailed explanation of each and every other topic and made it more specific by teaching several related examples.  Overall Dr Bae is good instructor but its hard to get excellent grades in his course, beacuse exams are harder compared to others.  Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly.  Effectiveness is normal. not good, not bad. we get only theoretical knowledge which is available in textbook also.  pros Very Professional in work ethic cons solves few problems, cannot understand matter completely, boring, lack of examples, tough paper and tough grader, lots of homework, information can be improved  sometimes it gets difficult to pay attention in class. It gets monotonous and boring, the professor has no trick to gather students attention or keep them involved.  One of the best professors who has taught me.

341,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 2,"Yes.  Yes.  yes  Yes  Yes  Yes,  Yes, generally, but I also think that his homework grading was a little bit harsh.  We often had to use the book to figure out how to complete the problems, and often from poorly worded questions on the book's part.  The book was not very good overall, so it was never any surprise when I didn't get a homework question correct.  Also, the feedback on the homework was usually very vague and unhelpful.  Yes, Ha-Rok Bae evluated the work we did based on the concepts and principals of FEA.  Yes he followed his syllabus closely in addition to providing a rubric for the project. He also went over what he looks for in his exams (albeit after the exam).  Yes  Yes.  Yes  yes  Yes  Yes.  He evaluated us based on his very flawed grading scale. The work was relevant to the subject, but did little to prepare us for the exam.  Yes.  Yes  I believe that he evaluated my work based upon the expectations described in the course syllabus. The grading was fair and he offered plenty of opportunities for extra credit (on the exams)  and bonus work (in class).  Instructor offered very little partial credit on exams. ""All or nothing"" grading style.  Very unclear on what is expected. Always felt he wanted to hide what was expected so students will do bad. Did not care as much of student learning as he did about his own work.  He did not give partial credit. Hes grading seemed quite inconsistent. As a grad student you might as well just take 20 points off at the beginning because the graduate problems were either tricks or never covered in class.  No. Grading was 10, 5, or 0.  Mistakes in part A took off points in parts B-G in a problem worth 50% of the grade. The graduate curve was calculated from undergrad grades that have 30+pts of extra credit.  Yes, course guidelines were followed correctly and understood at beginning of semester.  Yes  Yes  Yes, Dr. Bae organised the mid terms exams really well. He made sure he covered all the topics during the examination and used to evaluate the written work properly.  Yes  Yes  no  Yes, but tough in grading  Yes.

He started class exactly when the clock struck 8:00 pm. He would normally start writing on the white-boards and the class of 60+ people would begin to quiet down. Dr. Bae used the full class period (8:00pm - 9:20 pm) to teach the material.  Yes  Always starts on time, often times would just start teaching without any notice and very quietly. Many times held us over the end of class and was very unclear on when class ended  Started on time and often went over  No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters.  Yes, always.

Yes.  showed ways of solving problems in matlab or mathmattica to help show it can be down by both hand and computer  He did a great job at answered everyone's questions  Matlab.  Yes, frequently asked for input and proof of understanding  He was very good at taking the time to make sure we knew what was going on and generally understood the material.  Ha-Rok used real world examples based off of typical entry level positions in the engineering to explain to us how the concepts of FEA would be important in our field.  He showed us how to generate a matlab outline to speed up the homework process.  He was always willing to help when I would ask him questions after class or email him. He was even nice enough to look at a MATLAB code I'd done and check it for errors, which is tedious to do. I appreciated that.  Would provide extra material outside of the class for further study. Would always stop to make sure everyone understood the lecture.  he made sure i understood what the course talked about and how other courses contributed to it  Yes  Dr. Bae would have us work out examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material.  No  Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well.  Limited interest in student learning.  Class itself seemed very interesting, however he never truly explained the content or material  but rather showed a matlab code on how the problem was done. Students were not allowed to use matlab on exams so many classes were spent wasting time on matlab code.  No  No, was not available during posted office hours.  By relating problems solved in class to how the FEA software directly uses the math in real world.  Answered questions in class, used Matlab to work out problems and Mathematica for derivations.

Which makes everyone to focus on his lecture.  Dr. Bae has provided labs regularly for having a practical demonstration on this subject and also made us choose our own project and work on it for better understanding of the subject which had made me gain more interest in this subject.  Yes  Shows interest to share knowledge to us.  just asked the question that, is there any question. ? and nothing else  not very much  Not at all.

344,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 5,"Communication was usually effective, with occasional confusion.  Yes.  fair  Good  Alright.  communication was open and easy fast responses and flexibly availability  Yes, very much so.  Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hours and would answer questions to the best of his ability in class.  N/a  Very well.  Very effectively  he was very flexible with office hours and email.  ok  Dr. Bae used email and Pilot to communicate with us well.  The professor would hide away in his office when I try to contact him.  Good  Dr. Bae used Pilot News to assign homework problems. It would have been nice to have an inclass announcement during the day when he posted them. I learned to check Pilot just before class time so that I would not miss a posting. Dr. Bae communicated effectively inside the classroom. Unfortunately, I felt the class room was a bit large. His hand writting on the fourth white-board was sometimes hard to read when I was sitting on the side of the first whiteboard. Despite this challenge, Dr. Bae was always willing and able to tell us what he wrote down if we could not clearly see it from where we were sitting.  Not helpful during office hours. Often made mistakes during lecture.  very poorly. I did not do well on the first exam but after going over it i felt i did not receive much partial credit especially for a class that is very partial credit heavy in terms on content. Basically a sign mistake or an error in calculations gets only half credit and any mistake after that will get you no credit. Every problem was double and triple penalized for the same mistake many times.  When i tried to get help a couple times he was in his office, he would shut the lights off and even though I knocked on the door he did not answer. As I walked away, he turned his lights back on and even came out of his office to throw something away. When I walked back to his office because I clearly saw him walk back, his lights shut off again and he didn't answer when I knocked.  His office hours were after the class 930-1030 at night and it was difficult to find time outside of that for consolation. He was very unclear with his instructions (cribsheet size for example). He also was quite confusing trying to explain the course content. I believe he understood the material well but struggled communicating it with the class in a way they could understand.  Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. Notes were illegible, both in lecture and online.  Learning was done by looking at another teacher's notes, the book, or outside sources.  Very well through use of email and pilot.  Pretty good, homeworks were posted on Pilot, everything else was available through Pilot  Dr.Bae is professional and punctual. He always clarifies the doubts of any student in the class,he explains it to everyone. Outside the class he helps in understanding and how to approach certain problem students can’t solve. He is a great help.  Ease in understanding the subject, demonstrated each and every other topic . Clarified doubts even during the office hours and also during additional appointment hours.  Fairly good  In class communication is better as compared to out of class.  communication is moderate.  Not very approachable  Too technical and a bit difficult to understand.  Dr. Bae was pretty much effective in communicating the concepts both in and out of the classroom.",2017 Fall
345,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 6,"Course content was overall well organized, though technical issues occasionally occurred.  Yes.  yes  Yes  Could probably be a little more refined.  Content was organized but too in depth for undergrad. A lot of focus on the backgrounds and proofs of why more geared towards the grad level. This caused a lot of needed application time and examples needed to be sacrificed.  Generally the lectures seemed a bit scattered.  This is mostly due to the fact that Dr. Bae uses pre-written notes on a projector, which makes it hard to copy down and allows him to go back and reference earlier parts while adding new material.  In other words, he jumped around the notes a lot, which made it had to copy into our notebook.  Also, the use of MATLAB in order to solve the problems was typically unhelpful to my understanding.  I would have rather spent the time it took to write the scripts in class actually working through a problem by hand to completion, even if that means that some of the matrix addition had to be skipped due to time constraints.  This material is generally very systematic, which means that if we see the process a few times it should be satisfactory.  But writing a script just made it seem more convoluted.  The material in the lecture did not line up with the lab at all, which made it seem like we were taking two totally seperate classes.  Yes  Some content would have made more sense in a different order, the best example being the final lecture on software FEA techniques which would have been very helpful prior to completing the term project but was only given after the due date.  Yes except for the writing on top of other stuff on the board thing.  Yes  yes  the content and lectures were well organized  Yes.  Vaguely. He went off of his past notes, which were available online. That was very helpful. Honestly, if he put up his notes and examples THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAM, then I wouldn't have a problem with the class at all.  No.  It was a little bit difficult to follow sometimes when we jumped around in chapters but otherwise it was ok.  Yes. I felt the material was well organized. I was a little confused as to why the chapter organization started out as 1, 2, 16, 17, 18, but it was much clearer by the time I finished the class. I now know that the lecture was organized this way to make the theory in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 much easier to understand. The textbook is organized in such a way that allows instructors to adapt the material to fit their curriculum needs.  Course content seemed to be all over the place. Was not comprehensive.  Very unorganized. Often times didn't bring his notes and he would ask a student where class ended previously.  no  No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters.  Yes  Yes  Very well  Yes, Dr. Bae took his time and made us have a better understanding in every other topic taught.  Yes  Yes it is well organized.  yes  yes  Yes.  Yes.",2017 Fall
346,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 7,"I have no information on this topic.  Yes.  yes  I don't know.  I never had to go to his office hours.  Yes.  Yes  Yes.  Yes, Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hour appointments.  N/a  Yes, although office hours only being offered after class ended (9:30 PM) made utilizing them difficult.  Yes  Yes  yes  yes  Yes.  No. I would try to ask questions and he said he wouldn't help me.  Yes  Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well. He was also available during office hours or by appointment as needed.  No, instructor had limited office hours that were at unreasonable times.  very bad. This was explained earlier in the ""How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?"" I am doing bad in this class due to the lack of partial credit. I do not believe my grades on exams are a fair representation of my understanding of the material.  It is ridiculous to not give partial credit or put the learning of the student before own needs.  no  No, was not available during posted office hours.  Yes, office hours were directly after class  Yes  He is mostly available to students  Yes, Dr. Bae was available during in office hours and he also use to make time to be available during non office hours.  Yes  He is available at office hours and appointments.  they are available on line (emails). office hours were difficult to communicate.  yes  Yes.  Yes.",2017 Fall
347,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 8,"Usage of pilot could be more effective. The Course syllabus, lab schedule, and the only existing link to the project guidelines were posted in the news feed only.  Homework was posted in this news feed, but this news feed does not display on the pilot homepage, nor does it update the course calendar on pilot with due dates, making sorting out due dates a challenge occasionally.  The FEA project could have been a little different.  I think maybe we should have been given a part to analysis without the directions and then do the analysis ourselves to get the right answers. It took a long time to figure this out for the project since we were never really taught how to use the software, because the labs were just follow the instructions to get the right answers.  nope  Need more examples hand done like the exams will be. more so than the Mat Lab to save time. Proofs and theory can be read in the book and spending great time explain why it works is less helpful then showing how it works.  Dr. Bae is one of my favorite teachers at Wright State.  He's very nice and very intelligent.  He really seems to care about teaching students and he does a good job with tough material.  I would like to see more use of the text in class, that way we have some reference to come back to if we get confused while studying.  I am sad that he is not teaching vibrations next semester  Would have preferred if the notes on Pilot were more complete. I attended every class and took what I thought were adequate notes but techniques taught in class were not always the same as those in the textbook and the inability to go back and look at the material that we went over in class made some sections difficult. A more full set of online notes existed, they were shown in classes, but were not posted to Pilot. The lab syllabus was mentioned repeatedly, but there apparently was no lab syllabus. This was confusing.  He was funny!  no  Poor. Ineffective teacher. Please remove him.  I would recommend Dr. Bae for future classes.  Offer more partial credit on exams. Too harsh on graduate students compared to undergraduate.  Another unfortunate situation is due to the shortage of classes if anyone fails this class this semester they cannot retake it until fall of 2018. So if you are supposed to graduate in Spring 2018 your graduation will be delayed 2 semesters for 1 class in which no partial credit or explanation for mistakes or help was given. This is not fair to the student. Many people will be affected due to this. He is also very unclear on the crib sheet and what is expected on exams. Often times I felt like he was trying to hide what he wanted just so students will do bad.  The lab TA also could not communicate in clear English. A project worth 5% of the final grade was given with numerous grammatical errors.  The labs were not as effective as I felt they could have been. I felt they were focused more on following directions rather than actually learning how to use the software. Many times I didn't know why I was doing something, I just knew that things would work if I did. I felt a lot more things could have been learned, such as element type selection, were left on the table because we had instructions to follow. This made the final project not very effective because I didn't understand the software. I felt the final project would have been better served to be set up like a lab but without the step by step instructions. I think that was basically how it was set up anyway but I'm not really sure.  I though the examples worked in class should have focuses more on running through the problem from step up to end. I felt like quantity of examples work took precedent over quality of examples worked. Using MAtlab to demonstrate problems didn't really help me because I couldn't have Matlab on the exams. If distributed loads was going to be such a big part of the second exam, I think we should have covered it better than we did. I had a total of page of notes of the subject and half of that was the background on the topic and some stuff we did in Matlab with it. We never covered distributed loads in local coordinate systems not aligned with the global coordinate systems and it wasn't in the book. I felt like that was a topic that was important enough to cover more extensively anyway, regardless of its involvement on the exam. Speaking of the exams, one side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet. I was limited on the exams because I could not fit everything necessary to complete the exam on the crib sheet. I can remember some of the more extensive matrices or equations so I would rely on the crib to do that for me but since I couldn't fit everything on there I was between a rock and a hard place. I don't understand why we had to be so limited. I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final since there is more material to cover. It just seemed ridiculous.  (I forgot to put this on my Mechanical Vibrations review but what were you thinking adding a homework assignment and making it due during finals week. Really? I don't know why you couldn't have made it like this class were the last homework assignment was posted with the answers for our review to help us on the final and not for a grade. Seemed completely unnecessary in my opinion)  Dr.Bae gives a student friendly question with a very small twist. The only problem some students face during exam is they are unable complete all the answers in time even if they know how to solve the entire problems.  No.  For bonus questions in exams, he doesn't give half score even if answer is half correct.  We get more difficult exam paper as expected.  The exams question are too different than prof taught in lectures. I saw some questions that never faced in homeworks, classworks and in lectures. We never get any small kind of sample like such questions. exams were really hard and each question include many twists in it. Every question is tricky and something different that never imagined and experienced in practical and theorotical life.  I'm glad to have a professor like him.",2017 Fall
348,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 1,"He was average for the ME department. a lot of what you learn is taught through homework and examples so as long as you follow along then it should be fine  He is a good professor.  He did a good job at explaining the course content, and he answered questions.  This made the class easy for me.  Alright.  Very effective lectures.  Good balance of theory and examples.  i  Pretty effective. Seemed to get better the further we got into the course.  Dr. Bae was a very effective instructor.  I was able to understand exactly when he was trying to emphasize some critical concept for the course.  He was able to relate the real engineering applications to the theoretical knowledge that he was teaching us.  It was very beneficial to me since I had completed my undergrad ME degree many years ago and have some experience with the engineering applications outside the classroom.  I think he presented the complex concepts in an effective manner that was easy to understand.  Good instructer, but its hard to get good scores in his subject  Overall effectiveness is good.

This isn't really a negative comment towards Dr. Bae because he had to spend some extra in other sections but it would have been nice to cover.

355,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 8,"in class work is appreciated but some times students need more time to complete problems  I think the labs had nothing to do with the course. It was based on chapter 6 which was not covered in class and was considered an grad level section of the class.  The labs were the most useless things I have ever seen. Did absolutely nothing to enhance my knowledge of the subject. I know you said that the labs can't always line up with what is taught in class (at least I think you said that, it might have been said in FEA I'm not entirely sure) but they weren't even close. I had no idea what was going on in the labs. We wasted time trying to collect data when ultimately we would normally be sent the data to use for the reports. The lab time would have been better used explaining how to analyze the data. Of course, it sounds like you were pretty hands off the labs, and didn't really know what was going on with them. So I don't know if it was the TA that was the problem, or the lab set up or what it was, but they were a complete waste of time in my opinion. I wish we would have worked through more examples start to finish in class instead of rushing through different parts of them. It seemed that quantity was valued over quality at times just to get more examples on the board. I would have appreciated it if you would have slowed down some and fully worked all aspects of the problems out to serve as a road map.  One side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet and I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final (I didn't mention this on my FEA review but this statement applies there as well). There was a lot of material covered in class. I was limited on my performance on the second exam not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because I couldn't fit all the necessary equations on my crib sheet and couldn't remember what it was. The crib sheet serves as a reference so we can focus on how to use the formulas and not on what the formulas are. There was a lot of formulas for the second exam and I can only write so small to try to fit them all on my crib sheet. On the topic of the second exam, I understand that the conceptual things are important, but it seemed kinda overkill to make them 70% of the exam when most of class time is spent on application. The exams should reflect what we are doing in class. I understand that a few questions are alright to make sure that we understand the basis why we do things, but 70% of the exam broken up into 10% chucks which are basically hit or miss didn't seem like the best way to test that.  I appreciated his professionalism and depth of knowledge on the subject.  I look forward to signing up for other classes that he teaches.  No  We get more difficult exam paper as expected.  Concepts were not clear, too fast and exams were very tricky and twisting. each question is tricky.",2017 Fall
356,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"Not very effective at all. Constantly argued that he was right about every question until shown in the book he was wrong. Never helped students review or understand how to solve problems at the same level as the ones on his exams.  Amir spends his lectures completely reading definitions from the textbook with little example problems. He does not do a good job preparing you for future related courses at all.  Very good at explaining theory, but reads straight from the book for anything else. Lessons do not help with homework.  I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class. I learned more from the book. He just writes things straight from the book he doesn't add or make learning any material from the book easier.  Okay instructor  Yes, the instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. I am passing but, I have struggled in this course so far. In class we pretty much go through the chapter with very little examples which makes it hard when the homework is not conceptual questions only math problems which we hardly ever go over in class. The only reason that I am passing the class is because one of the three questions on exams is conceptual question which is weighted the most on exams. Need more examples in class and less conceptual notes.  not effective at all. I probably have to take it again due to his class structure and test structure. None of the examples  from our homework assignments nor what was discussed in class were on the exams  didnt learn a thing  Dr. Farajian was not an effective professor. For most of the semester, he was showing up late to class anywhere between 2-15 minutes late. Our first exam we had, he was 15 minutes late and kicked us out of the room right at 4:30 which was our end time. During lecture, he did mostly theory and barely any examples. Our test grades were not that great because we had little experience with working problems. It wasn't until after our second exam when he finally listened to us and started doing more examples in class. Although his examples were always a problem he would have us work out of the book with our tables and give extra credit to the first table to answer. Most of them he wouldn't even go over how to do after someone answered.  very poor, learned nothing from his lectures  bad  I didn't really understood him had to read the text book a lot to better understand the marital  Dr. Farajian has been the worst professor I have ever experienced. Class always started 5-10 minutes late everyday. His lectures consisted of scribbles of vaguely  summarized formulas from the textbook, and he also never worked through a single example problem during his lectures. The only problems that were discussed during class were worked through amongst our table ""groups"" with only a single answer stated by the professor. Dr. Farajian never once worked through solution to any problem for the duration of the course. these are just facts of what has happened. His demeanor was terrible. the professor came off as very arrogant and unapproachable.  Dr. Amir Farajian is a very nice and intelligent professor. He understands the topic he teaches. Over all his form of teaching was not effective for myself or the class. The questions he asked where usually hard to understand and then answer. The other struggle facing his students was a clear expectation with the projects and the exams. The final problem I had was the projects we had before each exam. These projects where a good source of points, however, he was not clear on his expectations and when the projects was complete and turned in, it appeared he didn't read them; just used turn-it-in to evaluate the project. I am under the impression that this class is not supposed to be taught well as a sort of ""weed out class"".  The instructor was ineffective in grading papers and getting them back.  Also, he rarely would respond to emails.  He was effective in his teaching.  I thought this teacher did a very poor job teaching the material.  When doing these course evaluation surveys I often go through them quite brief; However, Dr. Farajian's performance MUST be addressed in every manner and so I will do my best to fully explain my experience for every question.  For the overall effectiveness of this instructor: Dr. Amir Farajian has been the least effective instructor that I have had in my three years of college for engineering. I am not evaluating this decision based off of any personal emotion, but by comparison of other professors in my past experience. Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. Dr. Farajian did not have any plan laid out for the class and had no dates set for class assignments, quizzes, or even grade returns. His plan for lecture was to bring in a text book and go through/skip specific parts (he explained only as much material as the book did, rarely went into further detail). If questions were asked beyond the books material, the answer would be both scarce and questionable, almost hesitant. Almost all of the material handed into Dr. Farajian was never returned back to the students, which made it difficult to use for any further studying. As far as grades, students would not receive grades for an average of weeks. (Exams: 2 Weeks, HW: 2 Weeks, Quiz: 1 Week, Projects; 2.75 Weeks).  His class time is well spent, easy to understand.  After retaking this class with Dr. Farajian I don't believe I've learned anything new. In fact I feel as if I've lost knowledge from the previous spring semester. Lectures were dedicated to definitions instead of working through problems until 3/4s of the way through the semester when students went to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian to discuss concerns for the class. Only after that were examples done in class at a slightly increased frequency. I understand it's Dr. Farajians first time teaching this class, but I did not find the way class was conducted to be very effective at all.  Dr. Farajian does a good job explaining the theory behind thermodynamics.  He needs to be evaluated. He does not know how to teach at all.  He knew the material well. However class time was not spent effectively. He showed up late to class for the majority of the semester. We never finished all the material we were supposed to cover. He did not give back graded exams. Students had to come during the thirty minute office hours to look at their exams and then hand them back over to the professor before leaving. The professor always kept the exams, even though it would have been more beneficial for students to get their exams back and see the solutions. He was very ineffective.  He made sure that we knew the concepts. He also made us do projects that did not help us with our learning in any way.  less effective than reading the notes from the book a classmate took while drunk  Anything Amir said or taught in class was 90% of the time just a paraphrased version of what was said in the book. Going to class was often no more helpful than simply skimming the material on my own time.  no  Poor teacher, reads straight from the book and covers few examples.  Never covers how to use charts in thermo book properly.  Consistently late to class and canceled class multiple times, barley finished one chapter for the final section of the class which was supposed to cover 3 chapters.",2017 Fall
357,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 2,"no  Yes  yes, grading was outlined well in the syllabus.  His syllabus needed a grade scale and also for the projects a more descriptive rubric.  Mostly. Group projects weren't clearly defined in the syllabus and no information about presentations/presentation grading was giving. Number of exams/projects/homework were mostly as expected.  Yes  no h  yes, lenient  There were many things that he did not put in the syllabus that we were unaware of grading wise. For example, we had 3 projects we had to complete throughout the semester. Our first project was a disaster because the only thing in the syllabus was the requirements of the paper (i.e. single spaced, 12 point font, times new roman, and each table member had to write 2 pages.). There were no guidelines for our PowerPoint presentation that had to accompany the paper and we did not know how things were going to be graded. A lot of people didn't do well on the first project because we did not know what he was wanting and he refused to answer questions about it until after the first project was done.  not at all  no  yes  the weight of the different types of work in the class are accurate but the professor did not execute the course well at all.  He evaluated our work based off of loose expectations that were broadly misinterpreted.  Yes  no.  Dr. Farajian's syllabus was both limited and was not followed in certain areas. The biggest issue with the course syllabus, which I witnessed but did not encounter personally, was that the syllabus was very extensive; When students would bring up issues with how their projects were graded Dr. Farajian would use the syllabus and it's gaps in the instructions to support his grading marks. Although Dr. Farajian has the right to grade how he seems fit, I do not believe it is fair to the students to bend the syllabus after students have already completed the project and received a bad grade.  yes  Yes, the course syllabus described the expectations for the course thoroughly. There were a few times in which we needed clarification for the expectations though.  yes  His way of grading is beyond me. ive never seen anything like this class, its a joke. on our second project he told us we got 5% taken off because we didnt look prepared walking up to him. even though we answered every question he threw at us and confused him because he didnt even know what he was asking us. we recieved a 95% on that project i feel as though he was mad at our group because we out smarted him.  Yes. The syllabus did not give much information. The instructor did not get through all the material that the syllabus said we should get through.  The projects were not graded in the same way the syllabus explained. The grades were arbitrarily graded based on the originality report and the way we answered questions during our presentation. None was based on the technical content of the paper.  no  Homework and exams were graded fairly, but Amir never gave us a syllabus for the projects, so the grade distribution for them was unnecessarily all over the map.  Expectations were not clear for the first two midterms.  It would be helpful to have point values assigned on the exam for each question.  no",2017 Fall
358,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 3,"No. Was consistently 10-15 minutes late  Absolutely not. He was between 5-10 minutes late nearly every day.  Was never on time to class. He showed up 15 min late for an exam.  He has been on time once this semester. Other than that he was late everyday.  Usually late to class and then had to take time to set up projectors beyond already being late, which took up a significant amount of time for a 55 min class.  No, on multiply occasions he was anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes late, including on the day of our first exam  Has been 5-10 minutes late the whole semester only on time these last few weeks.  definitely not. many many times class started more than 15 minutes late. He was actually 30 mins late to the first exam!!!  half the time 5 minutes late  I believe there were 3 classes total this semester that Dr. Farajian showed up to class on time. As stated above, he was almost always late to class.  nope usually late  no always late  No was sometimes late to class  class was always 5-10 sometimes 15 minutes late and class time was poor utilized as well.  yes  The teacher would show up around five minutes late most days.  no he would usually come in late.  Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware.  yes  Again, until about 3/4s of the way through the class he was nearly always late. Students even ended up guessing each day how late he would be that day. Even for our first exam he was 10 minutes late. Since speaking to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian, he did start coming pretty consistently on-time to class.  yes  no, he was never on time I stopped counting after Thanksgiving but he was up to 170 min of being late.  Almost never. There might have been 2-4 classes that he started on time. Towards the end of the semester he realized we would not get through all the material so he showed up on time to class.  Quite often he was late by 10 minutes. He was even 10-15 minutes late to our first exam.  he was late so often we would as a class we would each mark on the white board how late we thought he would be. He needs a new watch more than he needs to be replaced as the instructor of this class.  At the very beginning and end of the semester, he would begin and end class on time, but during the bulk of the semester he would arrive 5 to 10 minutes after class was supposed to have started. Throughout the semester, regardless of whether or not he was on time, he often spent an unnecessary amount of time discussing semi-relevant information about the upcoming assignments.  The first portion of the semester was rarely started on time (5-10 minutes late). This improved the second part of the semester.  for most of the semester he was always late to class to the point the class started to bet what time he would come into class that day  NO, professor was almost never on time to class.",2017 Fall
359,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 4,"He didn't  No. Whenever you ask him a question, his answer would always lead up to him blaming you for not knowing the material.  He was interested for the first few weeks of class, but became less and less concerned with how much we were actually learning.  HE DIDN'T. He just came in wrote text straight from the book on the board. I would have been better off taking this course somewhere else like Sinclair.  Extra credit opportunities that encouraged solving problems and answering questions in class.  No he seemed to lecture only reading out of the book  didn't seem to care. just wanted to collect a paycheck. I'm disappointed I have spend my hard earned money for this instructor to teach me absolutely nothing  somewhat  He would always tell us we need to pay attention whenever someone was talking about an idea because ""it is all very interesting stuff"". He seemed to enjoy teaching the subject and always told us this is a great class for engineers but I am not too convinced he cared about our interest in the topic.  very belittling  not good  By giving out projects  there was no interest in our learning. the professor was very unapproachable  There was more of an air of frustration in our learning than an interest in our learning.  Yes, I believe he did.  He asked conceptual questions to test our understanding of the subject.  no.  From my observations and personal opinion, there was no interest in my learning. Many students, including myself, expressed our frustrations and concerns towards our experience in Dr. Farajian's class and they seemed to be almost disregarded.  He tried to carry everyone along  He demonstrated interest in a strange way. During class he would ask us questions and try to get us to answer them. The issue was that his questions weren't clear so we had to keep guessing wrong until he further clarified what he was trying to get at. Unfortunately that was also true for our group projects and the lack of clarity ended up affecting our presentation grades.  By listening to each individual groups presentations for projects three separate times throughout the semester.  He would give you a sneary look if you asked a question then would say see me after class if he didnt know it  He told us what important concepts we needed to understand and posted homework solutions.  He gave a lot of extra credit even though it was difficult to earn sometimes.  He didn't.  To his credit, he encouraged us to research somewhat obscure, unconventional topics for our projects.  he didnt at time  Demonstrated zero interest in my learning.",2017 Fall
360,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 5,"Was very poor with communication and failed to answer any email with questions regarding the course or course material.  His office 'half-hour' once a week is not nearly enough for the courses he is teaching. He refuses to hand back exams and says that to see our graded work that we need to go to his office, but there is almost always a line of people waiting, making it almost impossible to see him in time.  He was not a fan of questions in class because it put him on the spot and would just say see me after class.  He has an accent which is okay. But sometimes his accent drowns out what he's trying to get across so you just blank out.  Occasionally had a condescending attitude towards students when speaking with students during class time and in office hours. Wasn't great at answering questions in class. Would often tell student who asked the question to speak to him after class when the question and answer would have benefited the whole class.  very poorly  no comment  terrible  He never responded to emails. I had even been to his office to talk to him and I'll ask if he received my emails and he actually told me that he does not answer emails. He was always available in his office though to answer questions and I had been to see him a lot this semester.  ok  terrible  exam schedule and location was shady and not upfront. emails were sometimes unresponsive  His communication was better one on one than in class.  In the classroom, he did a good job of going through the material and was available after class to talk to.  Outside of class, I know students had problems with the instructor not responding to emails.  Very poorly.  There was very little communication between the class and Dr. Farajian. I believe that observing his communication with certain students who attempted to voice their questions or concerns forced students to keep their questions to themselves, which in return killed the class participation.  good communication  Email is probably the worst form of communication to use with Dr. Farajian. Getting a response was very difficult. However, if you went to his office hours he was much more responsive to your questions and concerns.  He did fine  horribly, very often said there was homework but then wouldnt post it in time so he had to extend it.  He mostly communicated verbally in the classroom. His communication was not bad. He did keep changing dates for assignments though.  He communicated pretty well out of class other than the one time he waited until part way through the day to cancel class.  He was vague and cryptic describing the requirements for projects and insisted that any misunderstanding was the fault of the students.  He did as well as anyone else reading straight from a textbook.  No response to emails.  not very well",2017 Fall
361,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 6,"no  As I said before, his lectures are all just repeated information from the textbook.  He read and taught straight from the book so yes they were organized.  Nothing was well organized.  Yes, but only because the majority of the lecture was copied straight from the textbook.  the lecture was but it took days or even a week at times to receive grades  no  all we did was take notes that didn't help for the exam  just wrote down the textbook on the board  No. He opened the textbook and were lecture straight out of the book. His lecture notes were hand written in paint on the computer and we could barely read his handwriting half the time. It was more beneficial to have the book in front of you and read along to what he was discussing.  not at all  no  Sometimes but it was really simple and straight forward  unorganized  Organization is not his strong suit.   I am used to more presentation than the projector work he did. If it was not for the in class participation, I think I could have done most of the work on my own at home (e.g. definitions, example problems) the useful content was his derivation and inclass clues to some of the things he felt were important to learn.  yes  Just followed exactly as the book word for word but somehow managed to make that unorganized.  The content and lectures were organized in the fact that the routine was the same everyday; Dr. Farajian was late to class, he would open his book and begin reading from where we left off. However, not all material was covered and the amount of material we covered would range from day to day.  yes  Lectures and content were organized for the most part.  yes  not at all  Not at all. We did not finish the course material. There were discussions that took place in class, but ended up in a lot of wasted time.  I think they were well organized.  no, they were not.  Yes. They were organized by the authors of the textbook.  Course content followed the textbook.  yes but they were just out of the book and you could have not come to class all semester and learned the same stuff  No, professor just read from the book and spent the whole class copying formulas straight from the book.  Even when going over the few examples coverd he would just write the answer with little explanation of how to do the bulk of the work required to get the correct answer.",2017 Fall
362,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 7,"no  Nope. See above answers  Never went to him outside of class.  Available for office hours, but very poor email communication.  No  I didn't want to contact him at all  yes  This was his one good quality is that he was always available during his office hours to talk if needed. But as I mentioned above, he never responded to emails.  no  no  Yes  less than most professors, mostly doesn't respond to email.  i never went to office hours  It is a rare thing if he replies to an email  Dr. Farajian would stay after class for a few minutes to answer students questions, however his treatment and answers given to certain students deterred me, personally, to see him during any further hours.  yes  Email, again, was just a hard thing to use with him. I would recommend having maybe another hour worth of office hours in the future. Office hours were only for 30 minutes each Monday and Wednesday which didn't feel like nearly enough time.  yes  60/40 chance of seeing him in his office  Yes, he was helpful during office hours and he answered an email of mine promptly and helpfully.  I heard that he wasn't because he only had 30 minutes on two different days but he was in possibly two different rooms. He should have had more office hour time.  I did not meet with him out of class due to his consistently condescending tone in response to in class questions. I worried that he might begin to arbitrarily dock points from my projects and tests as a punishment for taking his time  He was routinely difficult to contact outside of class.  No response to emails.  no",2017 Fall
363,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 8,"no  I would strongly recommend a recitation section for this course, I feel like it would greatly improve the students understanding of the subject.  Gets very frustrated and likes to argue when students have questions about material that he doesn't want to answer during class.  Thermodynamics is a hard course in general so why would wright state not have a recitation for this course. Also there should be more teacher options for thermodynamics.  This isn't a terrible class, but definitely needs some improvement. Exams weren't reflective of the range of material covered in that section. Only a couple topics covered for a very large amount of content covered in class. Expectations from students for this course are not comparable to credit hours associated with this class.  This class definitely didn't seem like a priority to the instructor because he was usually late to class, didn't return any grades in a timely manner, etc.  He should be seriously reviewed and evaluated to see if he is fit to teach  I wish I could get my money back for this class because it was a waste of time and money  I can tell it was his first time teaching, disappointed I paid lots of money for such bad teachers. Shame on the engineering dept for cutting sections of everything, and making classes so big due to their debt while the students suffer  teach better next time  bad prof  Nope  Amir Farajian should not be a professor at Wright State University. He gives WSU a bad name and makes students feel as though they have wasted their money.  I felt the class was more challenging because of the professor than the content.  no  Terrible teacher  I am writing this evaluation in the hopes that both Dr. Farajian and the Dean of Engineering will truly read this evaluation. I do believe that Dr. Farajian's attitude, knowledge, and efforts should not be accepted at Wright State University and my experience in his class has made me struggle with continuing my education at Wright State. However, I have had many great professors at Wright State and I will not allow Dr. Farajian's class to reflect on the entire Engineering Department.  Yes, the content of thermo 1 is broad, exams reviews should be made specific on the particular kinds of question that will be asked on the exam. Recitations should also be added to the lecture to aid student success.  As frustrating as this semester has been, I think Dr. Farajian is a good professor. There has just been a general level of frustration for the students in the class with him. I don't think Thermodynamics I should ever be less than an hour long class. There is far too much content to cover for the classes to be 55 minutes long. If I'm honest, I wish I had taken my money to Sinclair over the summer and done the class. I've heard nothing but good things for Thermodynamics from people who took it at Sinclair. I feel as if our school should too have that reputation for being the go-to for these kinds of classes. Thanks for reading and considering my criticisms.  no  i would highly recommend evaluating him as a professor because it has ruined alot of peoples views in my class of wright state and a large majority are talking about transferring because of this experience  Thermodynamics needs a recitation. In class, all we learned were concepts. There was an occasional question at the end of class which we were supposed to solve in groups. The exam had one conceptual question and two problems to solve. I did not like how the exams did not represent what we learned in class. If there were a recitation, then we could learn how to solve the problems and more people would have a strong understanding and pass the class.  There were some people in the class that disrespected the professor. People believed taht he did not do well teaching and preparing us for the exams. However, I did fine on the exams without studying much just by paying attention and writing all of the equations from class on my allowed cheat sheet. He is not a terrible professor. He is pretty okay as a professor.  It would be more productive to have the text(which was infinitely more helpful than Amir Farajian)  for the class be an assigned reading and take two midterms and a final just based on that than to sit through Amir Farajian's slow and lazy regurgitation of the book. It was extremely apparent that the requirements for the project were so vague and unhelpful because they were hastily and thoughtlessly assembled. I would much rather take this class with a student in thermo 2 than with Amir Farajian.  He seemed like a nice guy at least.  no",2017 Fall
364,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"The professor taught directly from the book and was not very good at explaining concepts in terms that were easy to comprehend. Tests were mainly derivations that I personally do not feel we were prepared for. The class range for exams was 30-100 % and there was less than 15 people in this class. Homework did not make sense, and class structure was hard to follow since notes were drawn all over the place on a projector screen. Numerical examples given by the professor were not helpful. His syllabus is not clear. More on that in the next section. He would ask the class if what he said made sense, and most of the time classmates did not know what to ask to understand the material. I feel as if I learned nothing, and had to jump through so many hoops for this class because of the Instructor. He is a very smart person, but he is not an understandable instructor.  excellent.  Low. Most of class was spent doing conceptual and not much practical application was done. The low number of homework assignments didn't help. I felt really lost on the exams because they didn't seem to have much relation to what went on in class. I don't feel like I learned a lot in this class.  Honestly, I did learn about four laws of thermodynamics and how they apply to different systems, but it was just a basic understanding.  When going in great detail in this class, many of my classmates and I were completely dumbfounded.  It is difficult material.  If the exams were easier, I would feel much more comfortable taking this class.  I always felt like I was lagging behind and didn't quite grasp all of the topics discussed.  The instructor is very intelligent, but the effectiveness of his teaching in thermodynamics of materials is hit or miss.  The majority of the class was spent deriving equations which we rarely ever used, and is almost entirely copied word for word, letter for letter, from the book, which is not a very good book to begin with.  If you are unable to understand the book, he offers nothing extra in teaching the subject. Following along with his lectures in the book will help understand what he is doing, but it does not really teach thermodynamics well.  Not effective. His lectures were just him writing the book on the board with no further explanation. The entire class regularly discussed how they haven't actually learned much of anything and expressed how they will avoid him like the plague in further coursework. He basically only taught theory and never worked through examples. All of WSU engineering experience has been learning the why, and then working through problems until we understand how to solve stuff we may encounter. He just had us write derivations all day and that was pretty much it.  Awful. Taught straight from the book. The book was already hard to understand and him teaching the same method did not help in my learning. This is my least favorite class that I have taken during my entire college career due to the fact that I did not understand what the material throughout the entire semester.  Moderately effective. Feel as if I have to teach myself or not understand.  I, and to my knowledge, nobody in the class, really understand the material. Like, we are all still confused about entropy at equilibrium. The professor is clearly smart and knows what he's talking about, but he is not great at communicating that information.  Dr. Farajian is an amazing professor. The best part in his teaching, he explains the basics so well.",2017 Fall
365,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 2,"I think that valuable information is missing from his syllabus about group projects. Based on what the syllabus says, he did not evaluate group projects correctly. Only after the assignment,did he elaborate what was actually required. Which was not mentioned in the syllabus.  good  Yes  Not exactly.  It was much more lax than I anticipated.  Yes, however, the syllabus is very vague, and many groups did not understand what the expectations even were, mainly for the papers and presentations we had to complete before every exam. As an example, there is no outline for what a ""good poster presentation"" is, however you are graded on the poster presentation as if you know how to deliver one already.  sure.  No. Never gave any feedback on work. Would take 4-6 to grade anything. Very unorganized class. The syllabus was poorly written and hard to understand what was being asked to do. The exams are nothing like the class or the material in the book. There should be more prep for the exam because we usually have no idea what to study for the exam, the worked out numerical examples are nothing like the exam. Some times there were sections of material that we were told would be on the exam and it would never be on the exams.  Not really. Was very lost most of the time when it came to his grading and evaluating.  Possibly. We never get feedback on our work.  Yes he did.",2017 Fall
366,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 3,"No, he was even late to tests, and did not have tests prepared. That was not fair to us, nor appropriate.  yes  Aside from being late for the midterm exams (like, really, the only classes you were late for were the exams? come on) yes he was on time and used the full class time  During lecture, yes.  There was a time when he was 25 minutes late to an exam, and we were still supposed to turn it in at the end of the set class period.  That was a bad day.  The instructor was late on occasion, due to him having another class 10 minutes before our class starts.  During our first mid-term, the instructor was 30 minutes late to class, and did nothing to help students complete the mid-term in the shortened time given to us due to his absence.  No. He was 5-20 minutes late for every single class and was 30 minutes late for one of our exams and then criticized the class for not getting it done with 30 minutes less time.  Yes. Usually used entire class for teaching  Routinely, yes. Was late but it was because of another class of his going over.  Class started on time when we didn't have exams. During tests class would start 10-20 minutes late.  I think there were two occasions he didn't start the class on time, it's not because he was irresponsible but he was discussing with students from  the previous class. So that's totally cool.",2017 Fall
367,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 4,"He would routinely ask if we understood the material, but he never really answered questions in an understandable way, so I resorted not asking and seeking help online after class.  he did it very well  Answered questions in class  He talked with us about real world applications of the materials we were learning and will eventually learn.  The instructor asks a lot of questions for the class and wants each student to understand the material, however as I stated before, the material is just deriving equations, not really much actual understanding of the physics or thermo itself.  He didn't really.  None. Did not respond to emails in a timely manner.  Cared enough to go out of his way to make sure my accommodations were met during testing.  He expected us to go out and find information rather than just giving it to us. That would be great if we didn't have other classes and work.  He find different ways of explanation for the same concept to help me understand better.",2017 Fall
368,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 5,"I honestly did not understand things and was confused by almost everything that was going on. I mainly get As and understand material, but his responses never made sense to me, and even when he would elaborate, it made it more confusing.  very effectively and made sure everything is going well  Sent out emails with information, told us of homework assignments in class  In the classroom he communicated effectively.  Outside of the classroom, however, I found it a little difficult to understand everything that was expected.  The instructor took quite a long time to grade and return any homework, papers, or presentations that were done during the semester, however he was available whenever needed via e-mail.  He didn't really teach the material, more like regurgitated the information in the book. The class doesn't really require much out of class communication. If by this you mean ""did he respond to emails?"" then yes he responded actually pretty well.  Not. He is very knowledgeable about the topic but does not know how to teach information to students. He would write every equation from the book (even though most were just the derivations of the final equation). Although this class is mainly about entropy and enthalpy and other thermodynamics, I still do not understand the key concepts of this class. They were never explained in a way that I actually understand, even when asked multiple times.  Well  Needs better handwriting- at times it is illegible, especially when using the computer  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 7.",2017 Fall
369,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 6,"I really do not think so. Teaching straight from the book with no supplementing material does not work with his teaching style. He would ask about our intuition on a concept before he had actually taught the concept.  yes  They seemed to be while in class but we moved slow through them and didn't cover as much material as he wanted too.  In my opinion the lectures were well organized and seemingly came out of the book.  Passed that though, the projects were all over the place.  They are as well organized as the thermodynamics book is, which is not very well.  It was just .writing the book down  The lectures were straight from the book. Most days the professor would ask the students if he wrote it down correctly as we looked in the book to verify if he was correct. He should know what he is teaching. The class was very hard to follow along and very hard to understand the material.  I knew what chapter and section we were on, but felt as if we focused in on things that did not matter and wasted alot of class time.  I'd guess not, since we are 4 chapters short of where we should be  yes, It was.",2017 Fall

371,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 8,"I honestly think this class could be taught so much better. Evaluate how material is presented. This is hard material. It does not need to be made harder.  nope  The papers were useless in terms of learning anything. The topics were obscure in terms of actually finding any relevant information about them. You almost made it out to be we needed to be in the lab recording the data instead of trying to find someone else's research on the topic. I mean, ""You can't use that topic, it is mainstream and there is a lot of information on it"" isn't a good reason. We aren't doing ground breaking research in these papers. If someone else hasn't put the information out there, we certainly aren't going to be able to figure it out. We had no idea what was going on and our main goal was to get something on the page. Complete waste of time.  Good guy, knows what he is talking about, but goes into too much detail and needs to me more clear about what is expected, especially when it comes to grading.  I believe the instructor is very intelligent and a good teacher, however the design of the class does not promote learning of the material.  Memorizing and deriving a hundred equations is not an effective way to teach a course that, while math heavy, should also have some understanding of its impact on the real world and their implications.  I hope that in the future more time is spent discussing what the equations describe and how they effect the thermodynamics of materials, and less time writing the same equations 50 times with different assumptions. There is also a very very small amount of the course that is materials related, so i am not sure how it differs from the normal thermodynamics class.  Nice guy, talked to us about how he liked us as a class, but it was very disappointing to spend 15 weeks just transcribing the book to my notes. I think he could be a great professor if he just showed interest in our success and taught at least one example now an then.  If the professor expects us to write a paper/presentation in less than a week ( with all the other classes that we are taking) it should only take him a week to grade it. For every paper it took him 4-6 to grade the papers and wouldn't let us start the next paper until he graded the past paper limiting the time for us to write the next paper. Although he said he gave us requirements for the paper written in the syllabus, it was poorly written and hard to understand that was being ask/what was required the syllabus needs to be rewritten with better parameters for the paper/presentation.  Nothing, thank you.",2017 Fall
372,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 1,"Not effective  okay  good  Alright he tries but lectures are disorganized and have no real structure to them. I feel as if this class is supposed to be a data analysis class but really is just all over the map with the material that we cover.  Far below standard, could not have been more disappointed in this course's instruction or lack thereof. Poorly executed, did not seem to care if students succeeded in the course or not as long as they understood what data meant. Fine for theoretical practice, but destroying students GPAs because of your poor quality of teaching is shameful. Kindly stop ""teaching"" because most of our class has this same exact viewpoint of your instruction quality. I hope I never have the misfortune of having you for a teacher again.  Class felt pointless to attend. Would go over example problems in class, but not give enough time to write them down. The lab section was too large for only 1 TA and 1 instructer to help during the period.  Not very effective  Rough. Notes were extremely hard to read and explanations did little help  poor  Dr. Jackson can be unorganized at times but overall did a decent job of teaching the subject. He has a lot of practical knowledge which he shares on a normal basis.  m  the worst class in history. he doesn't know anything about the subject waste time and if your student with color you get picked on and have to prove and show everything you do, for example he always ask them to prove there work and question them and blame them for cheating even if they never did. And he  have threaten more than one student that he will report them and he did that with group and he refused meeting with them,then it was proved that the student didn't cheated but used the pilot file like every other student but unfortunately for him if you not white your cheater till proven not.  He was not very effective. I found it difficult to learn from him because he would go off on a tangent. There were also equations that would have been nice to talk about in class and what they mean. Sometimes we did cover some and sometimes we did not. He was a super nice guy and meant the best but the teaching did not help me what so ever. He said it may have helped to have more LA's and he may have been correct but I am not sure. Our LA did not do much other than when it came to lab help.  Not very effective. Hard to follow. Lecture material was presented as theory first in powerpoint form--good! However, the slides were moved through too quickly to effectively take notes. Often I would get halfway through writing out a concept or transcribing an equation and realize the slide had changed. This would not be a huge issue if the slides were posted on Pilot, but more often than not they were not posted. Example problems were done from the textbook--also good! However, this presented a couple issues. If an example was worked out on the projector, handwriting became an issue. Work was messy, scattered, or nearly illegible at times. If the solution was presented in a printed out problem, the same issue as the powerpoint slides came up: the example was moved through too quickly to take effective notes. And if we were asked to do the problem individually or as a class, either we were not given enough time or a specific solution was never given beyond ""Johnny got 54, but Bill got 229,001. Okay next problem...""  This was class was the most waste of time I have ever experienced.  I have not learned anything from the course.  A huge waste of money as well.  NOT EFFECTIVE WHAT-SO-EVER.  Class lectures were a complete waste of time.  Nothing was ever really taught, some lectures we were literally told to get out our books and read them.  We then were told to ask questions, he answered NONE of the classes questions, he would try to have us answer each other. (kinda hard to do when no one learning anything.)  He cancelled many classes. HE CHANGED THE WEIGHT OF THE CLASS SECTIONS 3 TIMES!!  Twice the week before finals! His handwriting was so horrible no one could read it. He was so disorganized during lectures no one could follow.  When he assigned homework he never posted it anywhere, he would write it on the board for 5 seconds, then remove it ( no one could read what was assigned). Acted like you were dumb if you asked a question, and would not answer. Terrible class, learned nothing, Glad it is almost over.  Relatively effective. He makes sure that the students understand the key principles taught in the course in the way that they apply to real life scenarios. His ability to teach students how to solve the problems for the course is lacking however. He's great one on one though. Perhaps he could just go over how to do problems step by step to aid in student ability to work through problems presented on homework and exams.  Non-existent. It was difficult to learn in this class or even follow what was going on. The instructor rambled incessantly which only further added to the disaster which was ME3600-01.  The lecture were very boring.  It seemed like he took a long time on not a lot of material and the students lost interest. On the other hand, he is very willing to listen to any complaints and adjust accordingly.  Good  Dr. Jackson's teaching was iffy at the best of times. Most of the slideshows I got very little out of. It is telling that the most effective instruction in this course came from fully solved problems projected onto the board. He often gets talking about tangential topics that help us little practically or in the course.  Dr. Jackson taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams.  Largely ineffective. Lectures are too fast to actually hold any information. Tests are frustrating due to a feeling of being lost for a majority of the lectures. They are fair otherwise. Labs are disorganized. Only having one TA made the labs a mess.  Dr. Jackson was somewhat effective in his teaching. There never really seemed to be much structure in his lectures, so it was very easy to get lost in his class.  Dr. Jackson was fairly effective. I thought the first half of the semester was rough because I didn't get a good understanding of the material but as the semester went on Dr. Jackson was very effective in his teaching.  He was decently effective  caring and dedicated professor. Had a rough semester but persevered and did his best teaching job.  i barely understand what he says in class  The overall effectiveness of the instructor was quite poor. I consider this primarily a consequence of the class format. With 60+ students sitting in a room in Student Success Center, all facing different directions (half of them not facing the instructor), trying to learn math heavy material from a lecturer, to expect any kind of effectiveness is ridiculously optimistic. I personally consider the MME department's apparent ambivalence for this class's section size, room choice, and text, an embarrassment to the college.  Not very effective at all. The way the class is designed is not the best, it should definitely be a lecture hall class. The book that is used in the class has a lot of mistakes in it, not helping with the learning of the material at all. Something always went wrong in lab, to the point where the class grading scale had to be adjusted three times due to a lab not going as planned.  Low effectiveness, lectures were generally ineffective and reading the book provided the same amount of instruction as the professor.  Not effective  very ineffective  This instructor was not very effective in teaching the material. We just jumped around to different sections of the book which was hard to follow. Some of the book answers and examples were wrong which made things difficult. Also the things written on the projector were very difficult to read and to follow. He could have done a much better job of Assigning homeworks. He just did them by casual mention in class and never even gave the full details about due dates.  He covered the material verbally and related it to real world situations from his own experiences which was nice.  Much more effective at teaching material when going through examples.  He is not an effective instructor. I did not learn anything from him. I did not understand anything because of the way he teaches. By far the worst professor I have ever had. He goes on rants and does not focus on the topics. He expects the student to know everything. He has favoritism, his favorite students get A's in the labs and the homework. He does not go over problems step by step, if someone yells the right answer, he will move on to the next question. Students have continuously complained about the grading system, the way he teaches, and his overall quality as a teacher. He does not have what it takes to be a professor. Sadly, Wright State has no money to hire a decent professor and begged him to come back to teach. Therefore the students do not have a choice and these evaluations are worthless.",2017 Fall
373,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 2,"No. The syllabus changed twice to alter how much each assignment was worth for the final grade.  yes  yes  His syllabus changed quite often. Grading was liking drawing a number out of a hat for homework.  No. due to lack of preparation and organization, labs were not able to be run, we didnt get our graded assignments back at all, and they were graded harshly but not returned so we never knew what we did wrong.  No. The syllabus grade distributions changed 3 times within the last 2 weeks of class, making it very difficult to evaluate how well you were doing in the course.  Yes  Yes  yes  No  Yes he did.  no he changed the grading twice. he told us one of labs is not with much at all. the day of lab we didn't have time he told people to wait because he didn't know what to do. till the last minutes in class then helped them and told them you can satay after class and they didn't stay an a hour after class because he didn't know how to do the lab he need it to see how other student will do it first. then the day after he email us and say that lab worth 14% now.  For the most part. He ended up changing some things from the syllabus and the weight distribution of the grades. The material was covered like it said in the syllabus though.  Mostly. Some weighting had to be changed because we essentially skipped a lab we were supposed to do a full report on. This is at no fault of the instructor. Partially faulty equipment is to blame. But this is also due to the fact that we did not have an LA/TA/lab assistant (we needed multiple for such a large lab) present, so the vast majority of the class could not get their equipment to work properly. PLEASE provide more lab assistants or whatever for this class--even if it is just for the lab. It is needed. I would have benefitted. Don't continue cutting funding because your students will suffer the consequences more than anyone else.  No, more than half way through the semester he changes the grading criteria in the syllabus.  These changes ended up hurting us all not helping us.  Than instead of getting our homework back in class we had to make a special trip to the MME dept. to pick it up.  No feedback on the homework on what we did wrong.  no.  yes  I really have no idea. I have not received but a couple grades back and have no feedback on anything.  For the most part.  well enough  Yes.  Yes  The grading scale has changed so many times, but it is not completely his fault. One day, our LabVIEW software was not operating correctly, so as a result, he needed to push back one of our labs. When he pushed it back, he changed the amount of work that needed to be done in that specific lab. Because of this, he needed to change the grading scale so that it would match the amount of work. Overall, our grading scale has changed many times, so the scale in the syllabus is not the same as the final scale. However, I do believe Dr. Jackson is trying to be very fair in the new grading scale, and he is trying to accommodate the needs of the class as best as possible.  Yes, Dr. Jackson followed the syllabus exactly.  To a point yeah  yes,  not at all the time  No. Due to delays caused by lab equipment that wasn't functioning, the final lab requirements were simplified. As a result the instructor altered the weight of each assignment in the class grade. I realize the choice was made in response to unforeseen events, however it borders on unethical to alter the grading structure mid semester.  Yes, and no, simply because we strayed from the syllabus so much. The grader also did not specify why points were taken off on homeworks.  It is unknown because as of this time no labs or homework assignments have been graded or returned to any students.  Sometimes  yes, but I would have been more prepared for the evaluations if 60% of every class wasn't spent with him struggling and complaining about the projector  No he changed the grading percentages drastically which was not good. He did this more than once.  He followed and adjusted the grading scale when a lab wont work but other than that he stuck to the original .  Yes  No.",2017 Fall
374,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 3,"The professor was routinely a few minutes late to get things started.  yes  yes  Yes  Full period used, and more, since he could never tell when he was supposed to stop  Yes  Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared so class would not really be started even though he was there on time  Yes  yes  Yes  Yes he did.  no we waste more than half of lab because he never ready we skipped multiple lab times because he not ready or he doesn't know how blame CAT. he never prepared for any lab or have good idea of them.  Yes he usually did. If anything he canceled class but he was having family issues at the time so I would not say it is a terrible thing.  Yes.  No, we would start usually 30 minutes late but end on time.  no. Late to labs often, and cancelled class.  Yes. Class was always started on time and the full period was used.  Yes. But this time was largely wasted on explaining nothing.  most of the time.  yes  Yes.  Yes  Yes.  Yes, Dr. Jackson always started and ended class on time.  yes, every class  yes  yes  Yes.  Yes.  No the professor was regularly tardy, it was usually only a few minutes late but it was not uncommon for the professor to start the class 10-15 minutes late.  Yes but not effectively  yes  Most of the time.  Yes, expect a few family emergencies that were understandable.  Yes  No.",2017 Fall
375,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 4,"Dr. Jackson paces throughout the room during lecture, which encourages students to pay attention. He is very receptive to feedback which is greatly appreciated.  yes  good  No  Nope, couldn't have given a crap less than he did, at zero interest in student comprehension  Adding a curve to the first exam  Yes. He was more helpful one-on-one with specific questions than teaching to the group  Good question  no  You can tell that Dr. Jackson cares about his students and tries to make sure that the class is taught in a fair manner.  terrible he made me hate the engineering because his engineering ethic is bad.  He would try and bring things in lab to help our understanding.  Nothing particularly outstanding here.  He didn't.  He made the topics we discussed in class more stressful and harder to learn than they needed to be.  no.  He made sure we all took away the important concepts for future jobs.  Vaguely. It could have been confused with frustration towards our lack of understanding what on earth was going on.  He related the material to real life scenarios.  He attempted to answer student's questions, although sometimes it seemed he didn't know what exactly students were asking and answered a different question.  Dr. Jackson had us work on examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material.  He attempted to answer any and all questions we had  He asked tons of open ended questions in class and was responsive to any questions that we had for him.  Dr. Jackson would assign problems for the class to work through in class to create an active learning environment and come by each table to offer assistance. Dr. Jackson was also very helpful during office hours.  Showed a great interest in our learning  Always took time for the students and showed care for us as individuals.  i didn't get much  He encouraged participation in class.  The professor assured us that this material would be beneficial in the workplace and so we should listen.  Not sure  He demonstrated more interest in our learning than he did teaching.  Yes.  Applying the material to real world situations, its always nice to see how topics can be applied. The down side is there is so much to cover that sometimes it isn't possible to do it in depth.  Very caring individual for his students  Absolutely not. He did not demonstrate interest in my learning.",2017 Fall
376,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 5,"Dr. Jackson's written and verbal instructions are often very vague. It is difficult to know exactly how something in the lab should be done or to understand what he's saying when he's explaining a concept in lecture. Often when someone asks a question in lecture, it is not answered directly.  well  good  No  the absolute worst. responded to emails days afterwards or not at all  Overall pretty well, but would cancel class without emailing us. Only posting a note on the class door.  Out of the classroom he communicated better than in  Could have been better with some of the homework assigned as it was very hard to read the written on the computer  pretty good  Dr. Jackson communicates well, except for sometimes homework assignments were not communicated well enough. I recommend posting the homework to pilot and setting a due date.  he refused to meet with student after he file academic integrity file. even though wright state clearly say he should have meet with them before that.  He was hit or miss at times. I think he had a hard time understanding what the questions were.  Somewhat effectively. Homework assignments and due dates were sometimes unclear.  Reasonable out-of-class communication, although occasionally I would arrive at the classroom to find a note on the door saying class was canceled but no email in my inbox.  He was not encouraging or helpful. Also would not respond to emails and had only 1 day of office hours.  no.  well  No.  Good  He was ineffective in communicating many of the points he tried to make. There were many instances where I left classes feeling I hadn't gained anything from the lecture whatsoever. Very poor at explaining how to do problems, or even why we doing them.  Dr. Jackson used both email and Pilot to communicate well.  He communicated effectively  Pretty effectively.  Dr. Jackson was very effective in communicating with the students.  Communicated very well, especially with the circumstances going on in his life at the moment  Struggled at times with relaying information to the students.  i can't say much..  Somewhat effectively. It would have been better if he posted the homework assignments online or emailed them rather than just mentioning them in class once.  He was not effective, examples and review problems were not explained well and would only provide the answer not how the answer to a problem was calculated or derived.  Not very  3/5  Not very well for assigning homeworks and getting stuff posted to pilot.  He was there for his office hours when I ask and helped me through a lab. Homework assigned in class was the only issue I had, sometimes rude classmates would talk over him and I would miss assigned work.  Not effectively. Ignores emails and coming to his office hours did not help.",2017 Fall
377,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 6,"Yes.  yes but could have been more organized  yes  No  Never, this is not what I paid you for by taking your class  Somewhat. When he wrote on the board it was very difficult to understand. His hand writing was difficult to read and he skipped steps of problems. Also he did in class reading, then having students ask and answer eachothers questions. This made him seem unprepared at times.  No. The material had little sequence and was not presented well  Nope  no  Yes  Dr. Jackson stayed on topic pretty well, the only criticism I have is sometimes he did not introduce the topic really well. There were times where I knew what the math was but had no clue what topic we were even on.  NO  I believe they were sometimes. Other times they were not. It was hit and miss.  Somewhat organized. The schedule was followed very loosely and at times it seemed like there was no plan at all for that particular day. Topics were sometimes random and jumped around a lot.  No they were not. He hardly had any notes, if he did have notes you couldn't read his handwriting. He also didn't know how to work the technology that was used in the classroom.  NO. MOST DISSORGANIZED PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD.  Yes they were.  They didn't seem to be organized at all.  Not really  He followed his powerpoints. They weren't all that good, but we followed them.  Yes.  No. Oftentimes everything felt rushed and all over the place. I rarely felt like I understood what was going on, even on statistics, which was a course I took in high school. Even though I already understood the material, I felt confused each lecture.  Not exactly. We skipped around from chapter to chapter, and I really don't know why. Looking back on my notes and the book, I think that this class would have been easier if we would've followed the book in the order that it is written. I also think that the lectures were not always the most organized. Most of the time, it seemed like he would come in and just wing it.  Yes, the lectures were well organized.  Yes and no, and that's because of lab equipment not working and personal issues the instructor had to deal with, both of which are not his fault.  Could stand to be more organized  not at ALL, the labs wasn't organized he had to reduce the percentage for the last lab report from 20% to 10%, an splits it on exams and hw.  No.  No, lecture was always all over the place, and whatever examples the professor wrote on the projector were always very hard to read.  Very unorganized, specifically laboratories were organized very poorly to the point that one or two labs had to be scrapped and two hours of student's time was wasted because the professor did not attempt the lab himself or did not explain the procedure correctly.  No  absolutely not, but it is hard to tell if it was his fault or the book's  No it was hard to follow what was going on.  Yes very well organized by chapter  The lectures lacked structure which hurt me. The book used I felt was not good for teaching this course. There were too many equations to draw from and not enough examples provided in the book.  No. It was very disorganized and did not make any sense. It displayed how much the professor graded you as to how much he liked you.",2017 Fall

Absolutely. Due to an athletics conflict, I had to miss a midterm. Dr. Jackson was very understanding and worked with me to find a time I could make up the exam. No complaints here.  No, he was not.  yes he was  Reasonably, but he wasn't always helpful. Sometimes consulting the professor left one more confused then when he started.

379,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"no  No  For the love of all that is holy, if you have even a shred of respect for the students who pay to take classes at this university, either up your standard of operation by an extreme amount, or do everyone a favor and stop teaching.  The textbook was written very poorly and would recommend attempting to find a different one for this course in the future  Dr. Jackson needs more support from TAs, but also needs to refine his lecture material  Nope  did not get what I paid for.  No  No, overall a decent semester with some hiccups but Dr. Jackson was very aware of that and considerate of that.  i wish wright state start viewing what he's teaching  From my experience with Allen Jackson; I would not take him again and I can't believe the university has kept him as a professor here.  If you're going to fire anyone it should be him.  HO HO HO, so happy to be getting out of this class.  Great guy. I just wish he prepared us better for exams. You could do the homework and study really hard and get torn apart on the exams. Many found the wording very tough and the problems took far too much time to solve in the given time unless you knew exactly what to do immediately. I found myself running out of time on exams and getting a bad grade even though I knew what to do. I just couldn't work fast enough. Some did not have this issue however. He was fantastic at making sure that we knew why the work was important.  Overall a great person and someone you can learn a lot from.  I understand this class was understaffed which created great difficulties for the Professor and although I sympathized, I don't feel this is ample excuse for how poorly this class was run. There were several issues with the lab equipment, but these would not have been as dire if the professor didn't routinely spend 30-45 mins talking before starting lab. This in itself furthered the issues and added frustration.  Dr. Jackson seems like a pretty good guy, but his instruction is more than a little lacking. This was easily one of the most ineffective courses I have ever taken. I tend to be a straight-A student, but I often struggled even trying to grasp many of the concepts in this class because of the poor explaining. The labs' structure fell apart because of insufficient instructions and poor equipment. If this wasn't a required class, I absolutely would never have taken it. If I had to take it again, I would absolutely look for a different professor. Again, nothing against Dr. Jackson personally, I just can't say that he was an effective professor in any regard.  Slower lectures and more problems worked in conjunction with the lecture itself instead of just doing them for review would have been very helpful  No.  I heard terrible things about this class before the semester started but now, I don't think the class was that bad at all. I learned a lot and had fun this semester!  Appreciated him going through with the class even though he did not have to, especially with what is going on in his life at the moment. He did as good of a job that he could have with everything that was going on.  The class should be restructured, a different, more correct and clear book should be used, and some of the the labs should be redone, along with the lab manual.  I would not recommend this instructor to anyone, however since he is the only person to teach this course students do not have a choice and have to sit through his mandatory lectures despite the fact that the same amount of learning and instruction could be gained if a student merely read the book. His laboratories were the worst part of the class, he would regularly come in 10-15 minutes late and provide a procedure which could not be followed unless someone had extensive experience in signal analysis or have used LabView extensively. As this was my first time ever using LabView it was nearly impossible for me to complete the lab by myself and had to receive help from other students. Additionally, there were times when the lab was cancelled because a large number of the students could not complete the lab due to the labs being very vague.  No  the strain gage lab was a bigger disaster than the Iraq war  Thanks for the good semester. In the future make sure the pockets of rude people get broken up so your lectures can be heard.  The class size was too large with too few TA's for effective teaching and help for students.  No, because students opinions do not matter with the engineering department.",2017 Fall

387,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"The removal of assigned groups at the end of the semester could have been handled better. This semester, nearly all groups formed for the first such experiment made plans to be grouped during the last such experiment. An individual with poor group members is thus likely to have those same group members during both experiments, a poor position to be in.  No  My favorite lab I've taken at WSU  no  nup  At the beginning of the semester, the professor stated that there would be assigned groups for the labs. What this turned into was him putting students that he deemed as bright with students that he knew struggled some (since he had had most of the students in previous courses). This had good intentions, but what it meant for the bright students in most cases would be for them to do the entire paper. As being a so called bright student, I would read the parts of the report that some other students contributed and it was often wrong, confusing, and/or written in poor English. I was then left to the choice of interpreting their work and trying to fix it, or just to redo the section all together, with the latter being the faster option. This turned into me just doing the entire paper. Granted, after much griping from students, he did change it to where the groups were chosen by the students.  Wish the projects were graded more promptly. It was difficult to know if the work I was doing was acceptable. Lab manual does not do a good job of explaining what is required for the report (outdated requirements).  Dr. Jackson is great. I appreciate the things he taught in this class, the helpfulness he provided and just being an overall nice guy to have as a professor.  No",2017 Fall

396,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"The instructor covered a lot of material in the short amount of time. However, I struggled to learn with his teaching style. The activities were helpful but sometimes the lectures would be dry and hard to follow. I learned more from the reading and annotating than I usually did from the class periods.  pretty good  Dr. S was a very effective professor. I learned a lot from him this semester.  extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter, was enthusiastic when teaching, total effectiveness however was just ok, the entire class when it wasnt a quiz day and even having attendance worth part of your grade half the class would be absent.  I feel like Professor Srinivasan had very little to do with my learning in this class.  Everything was based on outside reading and group work.  the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well  Dr. S is a terrible professor.  He lacks any sort of teaching ability or knowledge of how to relate things to students.  Throughout this semester I have had an extremely hard time following along with the ""lectures"" that he gives on occasion.  I haven't really learned all that much, the quizzes were not worth a large enough portion of my grade to put effort into studying for, compared to their difficulty.  very effective  Not very effective. Hard to hear him in the large classroom setting even with the microphone turned on. The teaching style he utilized wasn't exactly the most effective.  Difficult to understand.  rushed through topics, did not take the time to make sure the students understood the material  Not very at all. I felt like we were just googling things as a class this semester (literally, we're told to use the internet and outside resources for the group work). Also, I felt like I was just in an online class, and I honestly would've probably learned more if it was. I felt like too much of the course was digitized to be effective, especially in such a conceptual subject like Materials Science. I would've liked more instruction from you as an engineering professional, not just reading these online powerpoint slides. I'm coming to Wright State to interact with engineering professionals, not take an online course. I felt like there just needed to be more of your presence as an instructor, not a moderator for our ""self/group learning."" Please fix this!  The instructor himself understood the material very well, but in my opinion was not very effective at teaching the material. The lecture's were hard to follow and dry, and if it was clear that the students didn't understand the material he wouldn't explain it further.  Very knowledgeable, bland lectures and sometimes tedious.  He was good.  He did a good job lecturing. This course was mostly a participation grade. Also, it was at eight in the morning and we mostly sat and listened to him lecturing. It was very difficult for the class to sit still and stay awake while the professor was lecturing as he does not have a loud, attention-grabbing voice. I did not like our online textbook. The annotations we did in our online book were graded very harshly. During the beginning of the course I thought it was impossible to get a 100% on one of them, but I managed a few 100%s. The annotations were worth 20% of our grade so it was a big deal. Also, annotations made learning harder because we were supposed to learn from each other. However, most students had a poor understanding of the concepts so annotations often taught the wrong way of looking at problems. Overall, annotations did not aid in learning, they hindered it.  He was not the greatest.  I'd give him a 6/10  He tried to teach the class, but it was not interesting enough to pay attention.  The instructor was overall ineffective.  Dr. Srinivasan was not very effective.  This professor seems to care somewhat about student learning however, in class he did not teach very well.  He would give problems for us to do in class without explaining how to do them and then he would not give us the solution to the problems after we finished. This left many of us very confused and we never knew if our solutions were correct or not.  He rarely lectures and when he does often primarily reads off the slides. There is little direction on the subject, seemingly random facts are given though.  instructor knows the material well but the structure of the class gave no incentive to actually learn the material.  I felt like his class was not fair at all. The group mattered more in his class. The final project I have done it all by myself just because my group didn’t want to help at all. They got the same grade as me and they didn’t do any work. This class wasn’t fair at all, I felt like this class should have been an online course.  fairly effective though a majority of learning was expected to take place outside of class; this method would have been effective in an active learning class if lecture time was spent working examples, but the time was spent on lectures  The instructor was rather ineffective, to my experience.  Good  Not very. I feel I have no new knowledge on the subject, however, I will receive an A or B in the class. That is a fail on the instructors end.  He is a kind man who shows passion for what he teaches. If you make an honest effort in the class, it is easy to succeed.  Lectures are dry and difficult to follow. Did most of my learning outside of class.  Not very effective. He always has his mic too low so it is difficult to hear. He provides great practice problems for each chapter but does not provide solutions to them and does not go over the solutions in class.  Absolutely ineffective  Not very effective.  The class does not solidify any information whatsoever. It requires minimal effort and reading the book does not mean the students know the information off hand at any moment.  Lectures are poor as we go through examples and then don't always go through solutions.  Effectiveness was mediocre  Instructor was not very effective in conveying the material. In the beginning of the semester a lot of time was wasted.  I learned the material better from online sources/slides from other schools etc.  horrible, didn't learn a single thing  Moderately effective  He is not a very good teacher  Overall, I do not feel he was a very effective professor. Almost everything I learned this semester was just from me reading the book. His lectures were very vague, and did not answer many questions students asked of him. I have put a lot of hard work and effort into this class to make sure I get an A in it, but I know many people who slacked off. They did not actually read the book, and did not learn hardly anything; yet they will still be receiving the same letter grade as me due to the set up of his class. Hard work and understanding the content do not equate to success in his class. Overall, this class and the professor was just full of disappointment over and over again.  Used the whole lecture to go over the course material which helped in understanding the content.  sufficient  Ineffective at lecturing and teaching content.  Dr. Srinivasan was not as effective an instructor as I would have hoped.  Though he gave a good overview of the subject (which is, to be fair, a big subject to cover) I don't feel like I got as secure a grounding in the subject from his lectures alone.  The homework was a good way to see how the concepts could be applied, but I still felt that, in some areas, he could definitely have been more effective.  Lets TAs do most of the work for him, lectures briefly and then expects students to know what to do.  Class is set up so it is easy to get a good grade and learn nothing.  Almost never responds to emails unless the same email is sent multiple times  Decent.  -  Not effective at all. His course was centered around groups. Did not allow people to learn. His 'lectures' were terrible and were very difficult to pull any information from.  very effective  He was fine",2017 Fall
397,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 2,"Yes, the professor followed his expectations that he had listed in the syllabus. He graded according to the listed scales and was good at saying if there were any schedule changes.  yes  His syllabus was very clear on all the grading policies and class policies and he enforced them in class when needed.  yes  yes  Yes  yes and no.  Dr. S used an online program to grade our book annotations.  This online program was very finicky and often the grades would change without our or his doing.  Yes  yes  Yes  yes  Nothing deviated from the syllabus, unfortunately.  The material was graded and weighted exactly per the syllabus.  Yes  Yes.  Yes.  Kinda  Yes  Yes  Yes.  There was no official syllabus, but rather a series of emails that were sent before the semester began.  Yes, all of our work was graded as expected.  Yes, he accurately followed hos syllabus.  yes  No, in his class the group matters more than the individual grade. I really got screwed in this class when it came to grading. He did follow the syllabus, but he was not fair at all. He made the quizzes really hard.  yes, grading followed the syllabus as expected  There was no course syllabus to derive expectations from. What was provided instead were a series of emails blanket addressed to the students, which theoretically contained the information that would have been contained within a syllabus. In practice, however, critical pieces of information, such as assignment schedules or the overall grading scale, were not included or included in fractured forms that had to be pieced together, and by having the information separated into multiple locations the difficulty of actually locating the information one was looking for became a much more difficult exercise than it should have been.  Yes  Yes.  Yes  The first reflection was not graded according to the syllabus, but subsequent assignments were.  Yes  Yes  Yes, but expectations are extremely low and pathetic.  Yeah  Yes  for the most part he didn't evaluate us  yes  He followed the syllabus  Yes  yes  Yes.  Course was graded based on attendance of class and completing homework.

That's not your fault, but it should be considered when half of this course grade is based on attendance.  Yes  Yes  Yes.  We usually started a few minutes after 8 am because the professor had to log on to the lecturer computer and pull up his teaching materials. Also, a lot of students came late to class everyday because it was at 8 am.  No  Yes  Class typically started soon after the time it was supposed to, and regularly ended on time.  Yes.  Yes  He always started on time and used the full time.  Class started on time everyday and never let the class out early.  yes  He stared on time and finished on time. I felt like that was the only good thing that happened in the whole class.  yes class time was well used  Classes actually did start on time, for the most part, and tended to go the full length. Whether that time was used efficiently is a different question.  Yes  Pretty much.  Yes  always on time and used full period.  Yes  Yes  Yes.  Yeah  Wasted a lot of the time through out the period in the beginning of the semester but usually started and ended on time.  yeah  yes  Yes he did  Yes  like clockwork  yes  He usually took longer getting set up, and so lectures often started a few minutes late.

399,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 4,"The instructor showed interest by noticing if table members did not show up and knowing me by name. He also would walk around the tables in the scale up classroom to answer questions, which was helpful.  He would meet during his office hours or after class and find time for you.  Always. He would also bring in examples of materials in class so we can physically see what was being talked about in class.  with in class work he would be engaging and walk about the class interacting with students  He always provide power points and notes that help us.  Not at all!!! Dr. S was very degrading and rude.  When asking him a question his response was usually extremely rude or some sort of snide comment.  I'm not sure. I would lean towards no.  He was always there for questions  He was not very interactive with students.  did not help when asked to explain a problem set in class  I'm actually not really sure. I didn't interact with you really at all this semester. Lack of interaction may be an indication in itself... I mean I guess you showed up to class so I'll give you that.  While the class was crucial to my major, however, the professor didn't really make the course interesting.  Homework reflections and releasing confusions reports.  Yes.  He had us fill out homework reflections and he posted the solutions to our homeworks so we knew the correct way of solving the problems.  He did not.  He really didn't, he just read off of slides  There really was no sign of this.  During the in class examples the instructor would not explain how to solve the answer from the initial problem.  He asked us to apply what we learned to real-life examples.  He would answer emails. Otherwise, he did not seem to care too much. If a question was asked he never actually would fully explain the solution to our misconception or problem.  Didn't seem to care much, atleast he didn't make an effort to make the learning worse than it had to be.  was sure to answer questions well and was willing to help  He didn’t at all, he kept talking during his lecture and when u email him, he never responds at all. That’s something that I really didn’t like at all. I have emailed him like 100 times and I never received one single respond from him.  occasionally brought examples/models to class and encouraged slightly more participation than just a regular lecture; however, having been in multiple active learning classes this one was a disappointment. When the opportunity was given to work example problems in groups, LAs were not always aware of what to do themselves, and the class would move on once he had any indication that just one person had gotten the correct answer. The class was mostly lecture despite being described and structured as active learning.  The instructor seemed to have an interest in the material he was teaching, but I could not say that he had a great interest in the students. In my entire time in the class, I do not believe that we have spoken more than five words to each other. We have interacted so little that I do not even remember the instructor's name, as all interactions, including in the classroom itself, were through a Teaching Assistant.  Updating pilot with materials  More than willing to talk about the course content and beyond.  Yes  Yes  He didn't, he just read off of a microsoft word document and the TA was of almost no use because his English was almost incomprehensible.  Very little.  Didn't at all  Very little, showed some applications in further course work, fewer in industry.  The instructor was unclear on many points or seemed to be disjointed in presentation of material.  No drive to have the students learn effectively since he showed little interest in teaching despite hearing of high praise of his knowledge on the subject.  It seemed like he didn't really care about our learning  by teaching class?  No. I asked him a question in class; he then looked at me, smiled, and walked away. He then proceeded to just do something else. It made me as a student feel very unimportant to him.  The class was like a normal lecture where we just learned from a powerpoint slide while he explained everything more thoroughly.  As much as he could with such a preposterously large class. I think the class would be much better if it was a fraction of the size it currently is.  An end of the year project relating materials to super heros.  The class was a bigger one, so little time could be spent on individual students.  I feel like, in a smaller class, he might have been more able to focus on his students, but his style was more based for a larger audience.  He gave examples of real life applications and brought in visuals.  -  Didn't really  being interesting",2017 Fall
400,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 5,"The instructor did not always respond to emails out of class. There were a couple times that I did not receive an email response about a question that I had.  Yes  He was always available during his office hours and responded fairly quickly to emails.  fairly well, expectations were always understandable, interactions through email would make communication slightly difficult  He communicated well.  The instructor is very nice and friendly and like to help us even out side of the class.  Terribly.  Dr. S would not answer emails this entire semester.  In the classroom he was often not loud enough and talked with a muffled tone into the microphone.  He sent out emails about important things.  very effective  in class- rushed through topics, didn't take time to make sure students actually understood the materials, the TAs were about as in the dark as the students and weren't much help either out of class- disorganized, changed due dates and emailed students two days AFTER the revised due date had passed  Communicated well. Not an issue of miscommunication.  It was hard to get a response from the professor outside of class.  by use of email.  He was effective in and out of the classroom.  He did a good job of communicating both in class and through email.  He was not very clear.  He just read slides  I would not know, I did not try to communicate with him in the classroom or outside of the classroom.  The instructor did not communicate effectively during the lecture.  He was rather effective with his emails, but was not very effective with Pilot.  I’m class, he lectured well but it didn’t seem to be what we needed to know in order to solve the in class problems. He lectured over theory but gave no examples on how to do calculations. I often didn’t even know what equations we needed to use.  I don't know about out of the classroom, but in class he told the class what needed to be done and when the dates were, however his explanations of thing are long winded and mean little without much context on new subjects.  pretty effectively  Not good at all. He always talking the whole time during class time and when I email him outside of class, e never responds at all. This is something that I really hated.  very effective with email communication, not all that effective with engaging students in communication during lectures  Communication was poor. Soft-spoken as he was, it was difficult to hear him in the classroom when his microphone was functioning, and impossible to hear him when it ceased to function, which occurred frequently. Being in a scale-up classroom, it was also extremely difficult to hear over the conversations of students which were supposed to happen as part of the course's proper functioning. Communication outside of the classroom was nearly nonexistent, with the only communications received outside of class being the 'dear students' emails that were sent in place of a proper syllabus.  Well  Always clear instructions.  Very well  Hard to understand him, instructions often confusing. Many emails over the same topic.  He answered emails very well. Assignments and quizzes were well discussed.  Mediocre  Average  Terrible. never responds to email, no communication and allows relayed you to the TA and wouldn't field any questions at all  Inside: There was a definite disconnect between instructor and class.  The material was simply presented not taught.   Outside: Way too many emails towards the beginning of the semester.  Consider consolidating the ""Dear student"" letters and schedules into one comprehensive syllabus.  Never bothered  poorly  Not very well. I emailed him one time this semester and he never responded.  Gave us information out of class by email to update us on class information.  as well as he can be expected to in such a ridiculously large class  Communication was attempted in the class room.  He communicated with a number of emails, and was reasonably effective at communication.  Very well.  -  Decent  very effective",2017 Fall
401,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"The course and lectures were very organized. The professor was prepared for the class and understood the material well.  yes, everything was laid out on pilot  Yes, he posted all his lecture slides on pilot and we always knew what was going to be talked about in class that day.  yes  Yes, but most of the class was spent figuring things out with our groups instead of lecturing.  Yes the material is very organized. and the lecture is very organized.  not at all.  Dr. S did not prepare well for lectures.  The lecture slides were usually out of order.  Dr. S would assign problems and give us minutes to work on a them.  Yes? and no, I don't really understand how students are supposed to learn anything in this course  yes  They didn't really seem like it.  Very rushed.  Would have been a much better class if we had more time to understand everything.  I'd like to say that this summer I was very excited about this course, but I'd now like to say that I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Almost all of the resources for this class were online. Persuall and the annotation assignments were probably the worst thing to happen to this class. I actually despise ebooks, and I was very saddened to here that it was required for this course. About 3/4 of the way through the semester and failing almost every quiz, I checked out another edition of this textbook from the library, and I have to say that my understanding of the material significantly increased. I learned more with my sessions with the hard copy of the textbook than with my time on Persuall. I feel like this is the case with several students. You really shouldn't force your students to learn with an ebook, because most students don't have much experience with them, and I don't think it's your place to try and force that upon them during my time in this class. Instead of trying to learn Structures and Properties of Materials, I'm now trying to learn how to use an ebook AND Structures and Properties of Materials. You should just require the textbook, not the form it's offered. I often felt handicapped with this because I learn better with hard-copies but I'm literally required to use it for our annotation grades. The annotations were also a waste of my time. To get a good score on them you had to write about a paragraph for each one, which leads to five per annotation which is the equivalent of a small essay per assignment, which is due like twice a week. These would take me on average about 2 hours to complete, and diverted my attention from the textbook readings. I spent way more time trying to get a good grade on the annotations than I did actually reading the textbook. . . JUST STOP USING PERSUALL and assign chapter readings so we can actually digest the material. ***I suggest that you get rid of Persuall and the annotation grades and just highlight specific reading assignments. If the sole purpose of Persuall was to to hold students accountable for the reading assignments, just do a small concept quiz at the end of each class over the readings and lecture. This will hold students accountable for the readings and will actually get them to come to class. AND the TAs might actually have something to do/grade (the TAs were practically useless, they just kind of twiddled their thumbs the whole semester and didn't really help). Also, I think you should do more of a traditional active learning environment. I'm suggesting you restructure the course in this way: 1. Stop the requirement of the ebook and banish Perusall. Just require the textbook for reading! 2. Replace Perusall with assigned readings, and test students on these readings at the end each class with a small quiz. 3. At the beginning of class, spend about 10 minutes working out a group problem that is graded by the TAs (so that way we actually interact with the TAs), and then lecture the rest of the time up to the quiz. 4. STOP DOING CLICKER QUIZZES!!! These had so many issues. Just have them be periodic written tests and have the TAs grade them... 5. Just have regular homework assignments and stop the ""reflection"" idea. No one sincerely does this... 6. If you decide to make attendance a grade, you need to include a series of drops in the semester for attendance and other assignments. This way you can stop dealing with people's excuses as to why they were ""late."" (Also, it didn't help that this class was a huge 8:00am lecture, so attendance was highly dependent on traffic and other factors) * I spent a significant amount of time thinking about this because of my level of disappointment. I was actually considering getting into MSE before this course, and the functionality of this classroom made me abandon that idea **  Yes.  yes  Yes.  Yes. He had everything ready to go even before the start of class.  Not at all.  Yes  Yes, they followed the syllabus really well, despite the schedule needing to be changed near the end of the semester.  No. After only 2 weeks the instructor assigned a reading on a chapter that would only be seen in-depth until november.  Yes  His lectures did not match up well with the in class problems.  The course content and lectures were never on the same page, the out of class homework never focused on what the lectures were about because they were always 2-3 weeks ahead due to how closely packed they were.  yes  It was not organized at all, we kept jumping all over the place. This is somethings that I really hated. We kept moving from the front to the back of the book and backwords, it was really bad.  yes the course content was logically organized  Organization of the class was poor for the medium in which it was used. I feel that the organization of the class was more intended for a regular lecture hall, and then retrofitted at the last minute to attempt to use the scale-up classroom method. Long stretches of lecturing were suddenly interrupted for the students to do a single problem with minimal explanation of the procedures necessary, and then almost immediately whip-lashed back into lecturing. The Teaching Assistants, which are one of the critical components of the scale-up method's proper function, were often not of assistance, and in some situations actually worsened the student's understanding of the situation. Recitations were quite often a complete joke, and did nothing of actual use for the students, something that the students quickly picked up on. Between all things, the class was an excellent example of a dysfunctional classroom. I would suggest, if you decide to try to tool the class more towards a scale-up design, to contact Dr. Randy Mieskoski from the Physics department. His 'See One, Do One, Teach One' setup has had a great amount of success with scale-up classrooms, and perhaps his method might be of assistance in reorganizing this class.  Reading assignments did not usually line up with in class materials.  Yes.  Yes  yes, presented from lecture slides  Yes  Mildly.  Average  yah  Not at all.  Although sorted in a logical way, the content within the each lecture topic was disconnected and did not coney to the students.  The information was presented not taught.  Learned more from other courses and online sources than this class.  Nope, they were all over the place every single day  not really  For the most part, yes.  Yes the lectures were well organized  yes  lectures were organized except for class work days  They were, actually.  I found it more helpful when Dr. Srinivasan lectured over a particular topic rather than only discussing it in a group setting. While problem solving in a group is beneficial, sometimes its a ""blind leading the blind"" situation. It was hard to find out if our answers were correct during lecture.

403,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"The professor did a good job of covering the required material. At the beginning of the semester he should go into more detail about how to do annotations and explain what parts need read of the book. He should also make sure to take the time to actually answer the problems that we do in class. For some activities we did in class, it would seem like he would have us do them and then never actually go over the answer. Overall, the professor did expose us to a lot of information about materials and was an organized professor.  Nothing about Dr. S but the TA I was assigned this semester for recitation and for in class was not very helpful. She didn't understand half of what was going on and she definitely played favorites within her recitation group. I feel like my grade has suffered because she would never come to our table to answer questions or help during recitation. There was one table in particular she stuck to and would actually sit with them for most of the semester.  nope  no, Thank you  Dr. S was absolutely terrible and I can say with complete confidence that his teaching is not effective.  Throughout the semester Dr, S and his Learning assistants have been extremely rude and degrading to everybody.  this class has taught me nothing at all and i hope to never have to take his class again.  He needs to be fired for being incompetent.  My learning assistant was terrible and was rude.  he routinely called us stupid and would not help out when asked.  Kimia was the worst LA ever. She confused me even more. Told us wrong information multiple times and spend 30 minutes per recitation looking at her laptop trying to figure out how to solve the problem. Was not prepared and did not have enough knowledge to LA for this course.  Nope  Overall, I'm disappointed. Please read my long comments above and take them into consideration. I've spent a significant amount of time on that because I actually care and was troubled about this course in general. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. Thanks for reading.  N/a  He was good.  I think the class was fair except for the computer grader for our annotations. When using clickers on quizzes I would have liked to see my answers to all the quiz questions side by side with the correct answers to the quiz questions. That would be more meaningful to me than just a grade. I also did not like having to buy a digital copy of the book. I prefer paper copies so that I can make notes in them of things that I think are important. The online book was cluttered with everyone's mandatory comments.  No  His LA's were highly ineffective. They did not have basic knowledge of the material covered and were difficult to understand when they did have answers.  His TA’s seemed more confused than the students often times. Also, things were never well explained. It left his students very confused.  no  This class was really bad, he talks all the time in the class and when u have a question, he never responds at all. I felt like this class should be an online course. I didn’t like this class at all, he always made me feel that I wanted to sleep. Also his accent made it hard to understand. The group work matters much more than the individual grade  the class would be better off restructured as a lecture class, because that's how it was taught but not how it was graded/activities were planned. I did however like the concept of group and individual quizzes, and how the homework was discussed in groups and then reflected on rather than graded for accuracy. The main issue I had with the class was the very high grade weighting on Perusall when the material was going to be lectured on in the next class anyway; there was little motivation to do the reading and hardly anyone did the reading, just did enough annotations to get the grade. That 20% of the grade depended on this seemed ridiculous to me; I believe there should have been much more weight on the quizzes and less on Perusall  This class was quite possibly the worst class I have experienced at Wright State. My reasoning for this is listed below. A large portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were annotations of the textbook, which was required to be purchased through a particular third-party site. These annotations were extended response sentences, and were intended to make the students analyze the material to gain insights into what the text was covering. This wasn't a particularly bad idea in theory, but the implementation of the concept left much to be desired. All grading of responses was done by the third party website's automated grading algorithm, with the 'best 5' responses determining the student's grade on the assignment. Those with a knowledge of what software is currently capable of would realize that algorithmic approaches to parsing English sentences is a seriously difficult task, which still has not been adequately solved by dedicated research teams. As such, there were serious holes in the algorithm that were quickly identified and exploited by the students. There were multiple instances in which students would annotate vocabulary words within the section, and respond with a definition pulled directly from an internet search for the word. These responses would receive full marks for the assignment, despite not actually having any analysis of the material done on the part of the student. Additionally, due to the minimum responses required for an assignment, giving actual analytical answers became a time consuming process, while students who exploited the system were finished in under ten minutes, and often with better grades. All of this was visible to the student body, as the annotations were public to those within a student's division of the class, which equated to about one sixth of the students in attendance. Another significant portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were homework assignments. There were five assignments across the semester, with half of each grade being completion, and the other half being a guided reflection sheet designed to encourage self-analysis, and also act as a feedback measure to the faculty. The problems came in that there was no actual accountability required in the process. Assignments were not checked for correctness at any stage along the process, meaning that students did not receive feedback as to whether or not they had properly understood or implemented the concepts. There was often little support in the actual lectures for the calculations required in the assignments, with the lectures focusing almost entirely on theory and disregarding calculations, which left students to fend for themselves in trying to learn how to complete the assignments. There were multiple instances of dishonest behavior when completing assignments, with at least one instance in which a student was taking answers for their homework off of Chegg, (a website designed for copying answers for homework,) directly in front of a Teaching Assistant. No comment was made by the TA, despite looking directly at the screen as the student worked. And with the reflection sheets, which were supposed to act as a feedback measure, that feedback was never visibly acted upon, and I seriously doubt that any of the feedback given within them (including some of the problems listed in these paragraphs!) ever reached the instructor. Across the board, there was not a great deal of respect on either side of the student-instructor division. For a Sophomore level course, seating in the classroom was fully by assignment, and attendance was mandatory at 15% of the final grade, with no allowances for missing days due to situations such as sickness or family emergencies. The instructor did not trust the students to organize themselves to learn efficiently, simultaneously removing the ability of the students to form into effective groups, which is a vital component of the scale-up methodology. Additionally, he had to resort to forcing attendance through grade manipulation in order to make students attend class, instead of making attendance actually worthwhile in learning the material. Whether or not the instructor actually disrespected the students isn't quite as important here as the perceived disrespect by the student body, which they reacted to. Students would attend lecture, and complete their homework for other courses, as they knew that trying to pay attention would not actually teach them. Recitations were far worse than lectures, and one of the most chilling moments was the complete silence as the TA stood by the board, with nearly every student in the recitation section working on other things, including but not limited to: Assignments for other classes; Crosswords; Video Games; Social Media; and Professional Accounts such as LinkedIn. This silence continued for nearly three minutes, in which the students were physically present, but not mentally present.  The students do not have a high opinion of the course. In an informal survey of about 20 students in the course of 110, not a single one had a positive reaction towards the course, and over half of them stated that it was the worst course that they were taking this semester. This was coming from students who were also taking courses such as Physics II, Calculus III, or Differential Equations. Over half of them admitted to doing other coursework during the class, and the vast majority of those surveyed stated that they did hadn't really learned anything. Now, this was only a sample of the class, and most of them shared a recitation course, but the overwhelming response received is concerning, to state mildly. As for my own personal thoughts, this course has been of little help to me. This course has taught me little more than what I could have learned from buying a textbook and studying independently for a semester. Doing that would actually still have been more beneficial, as afterwards I would still have a textbook available for reference, something that I will not have after this class due to the required purchase of an e-book from a limited-time third party site. I have learned more of the material for this class from its sister class, Metallography, than I actually have from the lecturing for this class. Will I pass this class? Quite likely so, and that is what concerns me. If I can pass this course not actually knowing the material I am supposed to learn, then other students in the class are going to advance with a similar or lower level of knowledge, knowledge we are supposed to know when we continue on to other classes such as Thermodynamics. Even if I do not fail this course, I feel that this course has failed to provide me with the knowledge I have paid time and money to learn, and that is what upsets me the most. This is not meant as an attack against the Instructor or the Teaching Assistants. I feel that outside of the classroom, you are likely all decent people. What I have attempted to convey with my words above is the state of the classroom as it appears from the student's perspective, in the hopes that what I have seen can help to fix the multitude of problems that still exist. I hope that it is of some use, and that changes will actually be made, as I would not wish this class in its current form upon anyone.  My TA was incompetent in recitation and never knew the answers to any questions we had. I don't feel the structure of this class allows students to learn the material. I believe there needs to be a restructuring of this course if you want students to learn.  Dr. S is a good teacher and deserves to stay where he is at.  This class would benefit from being a classical lecture, the ""Scale Up"" program does not seem to fit well.  Rework the whole classroom  Worst teacher I've ever had, I wouldn't even consider him a professor  No  the class should not be so large.  na  I didn't enjoy the way the material was taught and the use of annotation homework. It felt like annotations were added simply to add time.  -  Stop groups  no",2017 Fall
404,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"He's an amazing instructor. He has profound knowledge in what he's teaching.  He was effective when he used the boards and wrote notes. While he was explaining things that were covered in the book they  were not very clear and were not understood until the topic was covered several times.  average  Overall, he was very effective teaching this course.  Class time needs to be something besides answering the questions on perusal, this is not helpful.  The day that the chapter of the book was missing and you had to lecture, I actually understood that material more than any other section in the entire semester.  I personally learn so much better from lectures/powerpoints/worked out problems than by discussing the images in the book.  Also the book has so many grammar and spelling errors that it made it difficult sometimes to understand what the book was trying to explain. Many times the book would reference a homework problem or figure that did not exist.  The annotations did not help in my learning, I found myself working the system to make sure my annotations were equally spaced so that the computer would like my comments.  Very effective, however I feel there were a few aspects of the class that slowed my understanding of the material, described below.  GREAT.",2017 Fall
405,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 2,"Yes, he did.  Dates and deadlines were alter quite frequently throughout the semester. Based on the work evaluations were mostly fair.  yes  Yes he evaluated my work based on the expectations in the syllabus.  The first few quizzes were reasonable with multiple choice questions and minimal short answers. The last quiz was completely different format with no warning on changes. It would have been nice to know of the quiz format changes due to taking the quiz to potentially prepare better.  The homeworks are very difficult especially with no problems worked out in class time. Would have liked to have similar problems to homework worked out in class to understand the homework better. I feel that the homeworks were so hard that I did not really learn anything from it and many times did not even know where to start on the problems even with help from the internet and the book.  yes  GREAT",2017 Fall
406,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 3,"Yes, He's good in Time Management.  He typically used the entire period.  yes  Yes the class pretty much always started on time and always went the full period or over.  yes, always used entire period and many times went over, and never understood if we had another class after his.  yes  YES",2017 Fall
407,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 4,"Certain things are obvious to interpret, and one of them is that He want every student to feed on his knowledge. So he would ask questions, interact with students individually and correct our misconception.  He didn't actively take interest.  he would help students with their questions until they understood the material  He always asked to see if we had any questions. He also looked at the questions in the annotations and answered them in class.  would come over and help with homework problems when completely lost on where to start the problem, but then would leave us stranded and make us decifer what the book was trying to explain even when the book did not help.  He made a point to spend more time emphasizing topics that we had trouble with.  SOME WHAT. THE CLASS STRUCTURE IS HARD TO GET USED TO.",2017 Fall
408,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 5,"In a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 9 (Both in and out of classroom)  He tried to send out emails when he made changes to the course schedule. For our final project it was not clearly defined and more then half of the class thought it was a research paper rather than a powerpoint until a week before it was due.  good  He was very good at communicating both in and out of the classroom.  took days to respond to emails, but would sometimes (not always)  answer them in class time.  very effectively  YES",2017 Fall
409,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"Yes, it was well organized.  No he never came into lecture really knowing what he was going to lecture over.  no he just read out of the book  Yes the course content and the lectures were well organized. We always had something that we were going over.  no. chapters were missing in the book. Annotations were late being posted on perusal so the entire semester kept getting delayed leaving limited days to work on term project. Seemed as if lectured were just based off the questions on perusal and were never really planned about what was going to be talked about during class.  Independently they were. However, when viewed as a whole, I had trouble connecting the lectures with the text. The reading assignments were pretty densely packed with information, and I feel I didn't get much out of the reading assignments because of that. I feel that had we covered the material in lecture before we did the reading assignments, I would have been able to better learn the text in context, and used it as a tool to elaborate on the finer details of the topic that I had already become familiar with through lecture. With that said, Dr. Srinivasan definitely emphasized improving our understanding of the material, and was flexible in conducting the course to accomplish that.  I WISH THERE WAS MORE CONTENT WRITTEN ON THE BOARD DURING CLASS. MOST OF THE CLASS IS STRICTLY LISTENING, WITHOUT MUCH CONTENT.",2017 Fall
410,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 7,Yes off course.  Never went to talk to him and I never email him for anything.  yes  Yes the instructor was always willing and available to help.  yes  YES,2017 Fall
411,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"Yes, he's an amazing professor, we are lucky to have Dr. Srinivasan as our Instructor and as our Adviser.  The scale up class room is not an effective learning style unless the students can sink numerous hours in to the material a day. This is not possible for most undergrad students because they work and typically take 4 other classes along side this class and a equal or greater in difficulty. If just reading the book was an effective means for the majority of students then there would not need to be a person to teach the course.  the format of the class with the annotations and leaving students to teach themselves was not effective. It required hours to read and reread the text and going to google before I started to understand. The time dedicated to this class took away from the other classes I was taking.  There are multiple things I did not enjoy about this class. I hated the flipped classroom aspect where we are just supposed to ask questions in class to get answers. Sometimes it's hard to bring up questions when you don't understand the material enough. Reading the book and doing annotations was also terrible. I understand the point to an extent. It did help me some of the time but honestly I think I could have learned significantly more if Dr. Srinivasan would have actually taught the class. There were a few times where he lectured and I learned more on those days than I did reading the book by far. I also hated Perusall because of the way it graded the annotations. It's also very hard to create 5 annotations for like 8 pages of material and 4 of the pages contain figures and images. It is hard to have them all evenly spread out and if you don't spread them out enough, you get docked points which I do not believe is fair. I believe this class is a very important class for materials students especially since it is very relevant when working with metals. I'm disappointed by not learning more and better understanding the material from this class and I was extremely interested in this class. Another thing I did not enjoy with this class was that the homework was unbelievably difficult. Many times it was hard to find the answers in the book if it had the answers and it did not really help my understanding of the material. I think this is because we never did any example problems and never got a chance to see how to solve these problems. One final thought is that I DID NOT like how the last exam (or quiz as he calls them) we took (not the final) was worth more than all our other exams/quizzes combined. Our first 4 quizzes were worth 10, 20, 20, and 20 points for a total of 70 points. Our last exam was worth 75 points and the entire format of the exam was changed and he did not give us any warning that the exam style would be different. This severely hurt my grade in the class because it was weighted so heavily and I was not properly prepared for the exam. This has been a very frustrating class from the beginning to the end.  Overall, I do not believe the flipped classroom style is the best way to teach this class, annotations need to be done better, homework needs to be better, and he needs to communicate a little better about exams/quizzes if things are going to change and if they are going to be so heavily weighted.  FORMAT OF CLASS COULD BE CHANGED A LITTLE, BUT IT WAS GOOD LEARNING AT THE SAME TIME.",2017 Fall

Terrible- his idea of teaching is bringing up a a slide, picking one word out (i.e. feed rate), verbalizing that one word and moving on to the next slide. When he does an example he will slide through it as fast as possible and say "" da da da da da"" as he scrolls through the steps. doesnt explain any steps or any reasoning behind why he did the steps. Class is pointless. Tests are only difficult because we  all have no clue what we are doing and cant learn anything. Book is also useless.  Useless  Okay  largely ineffective in teaching the materials that are presented  Great guy, not the best professor  worse than awful  Dr. Lieh would often get distracted and get off topic. He cared for his students, but class time was not always well spent.  Not effective  Effective  Not Effective  5/10  Excellent  ok  very good professor  There was to much material covered to be of any real world use. He did the best he could to explain different topics but without any real experience with the equipment sometime the variables used in calculations were unclear as to why they were that value. The book wasn't very effective at clearing up issues either.",2017 Fall
509,ME 4870,Junghsen Lieh,Question 2,"Yes, was willing to go over a problem we were stuck in and how to do do well in project.

He is very unclear and scattered about everything. Expectations were not always clear.  Email  communication was pretty poor  Out of classroom: N/A In classroom: 7/10  not  good  There were allot of rude international students that would talk over him constantly that was frustrating sometimes.",2017 Fall

515,ME 4870,Junghsen Lieh,Question 8,"For the future, a better machining textbook would help since it seems the machining textbook we used had much errors and was horribly disorganized.  Dr. Lieh is a terrible professor and should not be teaching any course at WSU. I wish I could be refunded for this course because I have learned nothing and have had my time wasted.  Retire  No  class time is really boring. Shorter note and more small practice so student learn bit by bit. After that they can do a full problem.  This class was not worth paying for, if it wasn't for the lab portion this would have been a complete waste of time. The in class portion taught me absolutely nothing.  no  No  no thank you  no  Thanks for the good semester. Drop the grinding chapter since we don't use one in the lab and the section on shapers.",2017 Fall
516,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 1,"Not effective. Very unorganized. I had no idea when assignments were due or what assignments to do as their due dates seemed arbitrary.  Not good.  He is by far the most useless professor I have ever had. Unprepared is too good of a word for him. It seems as if this is the first time he has taught the course, yet when looking on wings express I found he has taught the course SEVERAL times. I cannot even begin to find the words to express his mediocrity.  Ineffective  Not very effective  awful I often left more confused after class and he is unorganized and this harm the students  Dr. Lieh's capstone class was much more difficult than the classroom section of senior design should be. We spent the first half of the semester completing assignments and going over topics that did not relate at all to the senior design projects, and the second half rushing to finish our proposals. We never were given a specific set of requirements for our assignments. Instead, he would act nonchalant about the assignments and then grade them very harshly. Most of the time in the classroom seemed wasted, as it would have been more beneficial to just get that period to work on our own projects.  This is the most ineffective instructor I've had in my 121 credit hours of higher education. Why does he teach here?  the instructor had some issues applying the guidelines for the class at first and didn't really post things on pilot on a regular basis  Moderately effective, I feel the instructional pace could have been quicker, which would have left more time for working on projects and assignments.  reasonably effective  He's not. No one ever knew what was due, when it was due, and what was going on. I still don't know what I was supposed to get out of that class.  He didn't have a reliable syllabus. The only reason we knew to turn something in was by word of mouth.  His grading... it's laughable. I'm 93% sure he just randomly chooses a number - much like I just did with the 93%. He didn't inform us of ANYTHING related to our senior design project. We didn't even know we were supposed to find a project by emailing professors until the second class. By that time, all the good projects were gone.  OK, COULD BE BETTER",2017 Fall
517,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 2,"Course seemed unnecessary. Lab work on the actual projects was more important than lecture time.  Kind of.  He constantly changed due dates, often completely forgetting what his syllabus said. Before the Thanksgiving break, he changed a due date to the following Monday after break. He made this change two days after our assignment was due, after the vast majority of the class had already submitted their assignments.  No clue because grades were not uploaded to pilot so i have no clue what my current grade is. We received graded papers back but he would change things or give extra credit so in the end you wouldn't know what your grade was.  There were no concrete expectations outlined in the syllabus  no he would constantly make up assignments and change due dates and course work.  He would assign things, but he would give us no outline or rubric and then would grade them very harshly because we didn't do it the way he wanted even though we were never shown how it was supposed to be done. For our proposals, he would just say to first turn in a baby proposal and then at the end of the semester turn in an adult proposal. We did that to the best of our ability given the lack of instruction on what was expected, and our grade suffered mightily because of it.  Absolutely not. His expectations were very unclear. I only ever knew what was due because I heard about it from other students. He very rarely posted assignments on pilot, or wrote them on the board at least. But then when we turned in what we thought he wanted, we'd get low grades because it was missing things we didn't know we needed. I have a 4.0 GPA, so I know how to pay attention, follow instructions, and complete assignments if I have guidelines. How am I supposed to complete assignments that I don't know exist or I don't know the guidelines? I once emailed him back and forth 5 times asking for guidelines for a paper, and only after harassing him for an entire weekend did he post something. This is a class that should be dedicated to our final project, but it was impossible to keep Dr. Lieh pleased.  yes  Not really. Assignments were graded on criteria that were either vaguely alluded to, or not even communication to the students. Grading was inconsistent. He did however give us opportunities to correct assignments. I understand that letting students fail then teaching them through correction is a method sometimes used, I find it to not be conducive to learning and a waste of time. I didn't learn anything by not being able to practice concepts and procedures, then wasting time by doing the assignment twice.  somewhat  YES",2017 Fall
518,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 3,"Yes  Yes.  He would routinely go on tangents, talking about the American Dream, speaking about how hard work and determination would help you sell yourself to the real world. What this had to do with Gantt Charts and risk management, I have no idea.  Yes  Yes  no he showed up late rather often  Yes  Yes, but one time he fell asleep. I have a picture to prove it.  yes  yes  yes  YES",2017 Fall
519,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 4,"Dr. Lieh was helpful in passing along beneficial information to assist in developing future projects.  He brought in lots of guest speakers.  If it's possible to have lost brain cells and intelligence from having sat in his class, then I'm sure it's happened to me.  He didn't, he would rather talk about himself and his accomplishments.  he did not show any interest in students learning.  No  He demonstrated no interest. If he were interested, he would've been more clear about assignments and easy to work with when asking questions.  he talked about the multiple projects that engineers work on and how beneficial those projects will be when completed.  by allowing us to correct assignments  yes  NOT AT ALL. HE IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THE TOPICS DID NOT INCREASE MY INTEREST IN BECOMING AN ENGINEER.",2017 Fall
520,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 5,"Did not clearly indicate expectations for class, nor assignment due dates.  Poorly.  Abysmal. He refused to use pilot, stating ""it never worked for him"". And when he did use pilot, he only used to news section to make posts. This meant that no notification went out to alert students to when he made an assignment. The only way to have knowledge of his posts is to have been looking at pilot at the right time. Then when class starts and we had no idea that he wanted us to do something, he would get angry and rant about how pilot is trash and how he never wants to use it. Any suggestions given to him on alternatives for how he could communicate differently were shot down in flames.  Awful, I never knew what was going on and honestly I don't think he did either.  Poorly  awful, when I went to his office hours to ask a question he responded with ""come to class and youll find out"" even though I had not missed a class previous to this and met him during his office hours.  He would respond but wouldn't answer the question you had  Terrible communication. Was hard to get an email response out of him, and didn't make assignment due dates or expectations clear in class. His accent is difficult to understand, but if he could at least write assignments on the board that would help, or utilize pilot. A lot of times he'd dismiss class, and then while everyone was packing up and leaving, he'd start talking about assignments or writing things on the board. At that point, no one can hear or they're leaving.  unknown  not well, I understood probably 2/3 of what he said because of the language difference  the instructor communicated somewhat effecitvely  HA!  NOT GOOD. BAD USE OF PILOT AND EMAIL, IN MY OPINION.",2017 Fall
521,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 6,"No. Class seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. Lab time for each group would have been more effective.  Not at all.  As I am sure you can infer from previous statements made, organization is not Lieh's forte. Tangents, asides, and branching off are the only way that he knows how to communicate. It was far too often that he would be speaking and I would have to look at someone and ask ""how is this relevant to anything"" only to be met with ""I have no idea"".  No, completely random, in the end he just filled class time up with guest speakers that I did not find useful for class time. The speakers were good and I learned new things from them but I could have done that on my own time and he could have used class time to maybe teach us something that we could use for senior design.  No  No.  No  Absolutely not organized. The course is supposed to be dedicated to completing our senior design project, but the course content did nothing to help with the design, plan, construction, or anything to do with the project. And often times he'd end up on a tangent about unrelated things.  it could have been organized in a better way  organized, but not helpful. While I did enjoy and learn from the guest speakers he invited, most of the core course material was a repeat of topics and tasks I had learned and been doing my entire time in college. A lot of the course time could have been better spent directly supporting the Capstone project or used as work time.  somewhat well organized  I don't know how to answer this question. What course content?  Nothing was organized, this whole class is a mess and waste of time.  We could have been given time to actually work on our project, but no that would actually benefit us.  NO. VERY RUSHED.",2017 Fall
522,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 7,Yes  Kind of.  I never want to have to encounter Lieh outside of the times where I am in his class. So I cannot comment on how his office hours were. But that statement itself should be loud enough to show his ineptitude.  Yes  Moderately available  No.  Fair  Nope. See any of the other answers above.  unknown  yes  yes  KIND OF.,2017 Fall
523,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 8,"No  I recommend immediate termination.  I think this class needs to be restructured, not worth paying for if this is what I get out of it.  Dr. Lieh should organize his course more and put more material and standards on Pilot  he is the worst professor I have had the misfortune of having class with. He shows no interest in teaching or the students and repeatably singled students out and tried to embarrass them. Due to his actions he hindered our groups senior design project from the start and continues to do so. I believe keeping him as a teacher is harming WSU student's education here.  no  Junghsen Lieh is not an effective instructor and caused much stress without getting anything useful out of it.  the teacher should post things more on pilot than just saying stuff in class.  Though the instructor was engaging in class lectures. Overall very nice person. Responded to questions when I needed to ask him. Just wish some of the assignments were more clearly defined as to how they will be graded instead of being more open ended.  What I learned in this class: Lieh had 7 years of straight A's.

524,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"Effective  Most of class time is spent with him explaining things from the book with little to know worked through examples. It makes lectures hard to follow and little information can come from them.  A very intelligent instructor, but wasn't very effective on me. The class made me more frustrated than anything.  He had a very busy schedule outside of class made it very hard to schedule times to meet with him.  Dr. Slater is very smart. However, he could teach the class more if he would stop trying to impress the class by telling them how smart he is. Bragging on your self is a wast of everyone's time. Dr. Slater knows plenty enough to impress the class by doing examples in class so they better understand the material.  good",2017 Fall

Email mainly, but getting a response often took a day or two which was frustrating.  Dr. Slater was fairly responsive to helping us even with his schedule. However sometime response seemed vague. Also too much class time was spend on him telling about all of his accomplishments. PLEASE DO MORE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. 30 MIN PROOFS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A WAST OF TIME.  good",2017 Fall
529,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 6,"Yes  Not particularly. It feels like he explains things with the assumption that you already know the material and that you are looking to learn more, which is not the case.  Could of been organized a little better. Manuscript used for the course was often incomplete. The manuscript he gave us did not follow the course content given in the lecture outlines. Equation numbers were different as were page numbers and chapters. Lectures just consisted of him reading notes and equations off his manuscript. Wasn't very helpful. Never went over any examples in class or anything like that. The lab portion of the class was very unorganized. We were never properly shown how to use the lab equipment. A lot of times the equipment didn't work.  We had to learn on the fly how to work it. The lab instructions were very plain (a sentence or two long).  Yes. However, PLEASE DO NOT USE SLIDES FOR ENGINEERING CLASSES, that is what they do in are history class  well good",2017 Fall
530,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 7,"Yes  Yes. He misses a lot of office hours but if you want an appointment he is available.  He was late to appointments in his office hour. Scheduled office hour at a very difficult time for the class to meet. Wasn't very flexible with this. I asked for a tutor or someone i could consult with during the week to get help with the material and he said ""there is no one else who can teach you this material other than me and a guy that doesn't work here."" We took our first exam in September and didn't get it back till over a month later in November. Actually i never received a grade back until about the 10th week of class which is ridiculous. Turned in homework but got no feedback on anything.  Yes  well ok",2017 Fall
531,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 8,"No  I believe this course is a very difficult class to take let alone teach. Being my first 7000 level class i took as a graduate student i don't believe i really had the prerequisites to take it. I think there should be a class or two before with material to prepare you for the material in this class. Overall a very difficult class. Much different than undergrad vibrations. Class was taught much different. Undergrad class didn't prepare me much for it.  I believe this class wasn't well organized, the instructor clearly knows what he is talking about with the content, but teaches it to us as if we have been studying it as long as him.  Overall I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. The criticism should be taken as things that should be addressed. But, not that he is a horrible person. I think he would be a great teacher if he made the changes listed above.  please provide some video lectures..",2017 Fall
532,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 1,"I couldn't follow anything this guy was talking about all semester. I kept trying and I kept rewatching the course videos, but could never follow for any significant length of time. Maybe I'm just an idiot.  3 out of 10 Teaches using Powerpoint and that sucks  He clearly knew what he was talking about but did a very poor job conveying the material.  Lectures are not too graduate driven. At times effective but at other times really confusing.  Dr. Huang is one of the best professors at explaining concepts that I have had  His teaching style improved greatly when he begun working out problems on the board. His slides were sometimes difficult to comprehend.  no comment  Dr. Huang is very passionate about what he teaches. He conveys concepts well verbally, but does NOT give students clear understanding of what is expected of them. He rushed through material very quickly toward the beginning of the semester. By the schedule set in his syllabus, we were well over halfway through the class before the halfway point of the semester. Dr. Huang's lectures are largely disorganized, consisting of frantic circling of notes on a projector. People began to cease attending lecture because, based on how the class was run, there were no notes to record. By the end of most classes, students left unsure of what they were supposed to know that day.  Sometimes difficult to follow, but that might have more to do with the time of the day the class was.  This class was taught at a level that seemed beyond the scope of what an undergraduate class should be taught at. Granted many of the students in the course were graduate students, many of the concepts were things that have never been taught before. It was hard to follow along with what was going on because the level of complexity of this class. Many students had trouble understanding the concepts and how to do the projects.  Very effective and informative lecture sessions.  Powerpoint slides were helpful, and lectures gave a good understanding of concepts.  He covered a most of the required material but didn't teach us any code but required that we submit our projects in a coding language no one knew, it was not optional what language we could uses  He is very knowledgeable and has a lot of personal experience with the topics discussed. Sometimes, that can make him think the topic is easier than it is. A book might make some of the topics easier to understand or reference later.  not bad  good  overall effectiveness of the instructor is good because he describes the topic very well but examples are not solved in class after the completion of topic.  A very effective teacher, in my opinion.  good  He is best  Dr. Huang is very effective",2017 Fall
533,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 2,"Yes  Super hard grading and assignments. Unfair is a good word to describe it.  Maybe?  We never got any graded reports back so your guess is as good as mine.  Yes  Yes.  Yes, but I think including an example report could help demonstrate what the projects are supposed to look like. Also, I'm aware feedback could be retrieved on request, but this would have been helpful if it were more accessible.  no comment  The course syllabus is red herring in regards to the class expectations.  There is no written homework for this class. There is no book. The number of written examples done in class could be counted on one hand. The syllabus suggests that use of the software Mathematica and Matlab would be used for numerical analysis. This is absolutely false. The only software this course uses for it's numerical analysis is Fortran, and the software for plotting data is Tecplot. The professor has students use a computing language they have never seen to run high level, complex numerical analysis. The professor supplies code which students must modify to produce some output specified in his ""projects"". Projects make up 50% of the grade. Consequently, students do not learn about Computational Methods in this course because the class does NOT evaluate understanding of Computational Methods. The class does, however, test our ability to modify files in an obsolete computing language that the class, even by the end of the class, cannot understand. The remainder of the grade for this class is written exams. Students have no examples to try on their own because there is no book. And because there is no written homework, how are we supposed to do a written exam problem when the only thing we are graded on is our ability to modify code we can't understand? The class should have been based around Matlab--the software we are all familiar with as undergrads since we've had a course in it.  Yes  I believe the instructor graded fairly based on the expectations given.  Yes  Yes.  Not on the first exam, He did not clearly explain to us the requirements  Yes  no  yes  I guess instructor didn't evaluate our work because his grader does this job and he is not that perfect in grading.  I am not sure... a TA grades everything.  yes  Yes  Yes",2017 Fall

Yes  The class often started on time, and the instructor would be in the class room the entirety of the class period.  Yes  Yes.  Yes he typically started on time  We were ahead of schedule and left early some days.  yes  yes  Yes, instructor did start the class on time but he finishes it early and didn't utilizes the full time because he covers the topic very fast without solving any examples in class.

535,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 4,"He told me he couldn't help me when I went to his office to ask for help because I couldn't form a specific enough question.  He had a lot of office hours and always made sure everyone knew what was going on before continuing to the next thing. But the people that didn't understand never spoke up.  He showed an intense interest in the course material.  Got very emotional in the subject matter at times which made it seem more interesting at times.  He is clearly very passionate about the subject and would do his best to make sure we understood.  no comment  He asked questions about our understanding of the lecture. No one could ask questions because the lessons were reinforced via Dr. Huang's complex Fortran code. The only pertinent questions that could be asked were about Fortran syntax. At one point, this class becomes less about Computational Methods and Numerical Analysis (already a difficult subject) and far more about Fortran.  He often repeated that he wanted us to understand this material because it will be helpful. He gave us lots of resources and materials that he believes will help us later in our career. I appreciate the time and effort he gave to prepare the materials he provided.  Projects were challenging and driven towards real life applications. He tried to fit as much content as possible into the course so that we would have a lot of tools and experience upon completion.  Available in office hours and via email regularly. Office hours were helpful in getting me to understand how to solve projects without being given the answer directly.  He told jokes to wake us up  You can tell he is excited about the material and likes teaching it.  not much  good  Yes, if i consider teaching he teaches the subject very well and his lectures were very interesting. But, again he didn't taught us the Fortran and was difficult to solve his projects because they were all based on Fortran.  Dr. Huang knows fluids quite well. This knowledge is apparent as he is very enthusiastic about teaching us.  very good examples  He add practical problems in assignment  Very good about answering questions and taking time to explain any difficulties in class.",2017 Fall

He gave us a retake on one of our midterm problems because of a miscommunication on his part.  Not very effectively in the classroom.  Not well, He seems nice but the grad student seemed to be in charge of that  Fairly well. Sometimes it could take a couple days to receive an email response though, other times it was very quick.  no comment  Fine. He's a nice person, well-intentioned. He offers to make himself available as any professor with office hours does. Again, lessons are about Computational Methods, but the grade comes from implementing it in Fortran. Which students could not do.  Sometimes difficult to follow. Admitted when he was wrong though.  I never had to communicate with the instructor outside of class, but from others I heard he was available during his office hours. In class he would answer any questions people had.  Very effectively.  Effectively.  Sort of effectively  Good  good in the classroom  9/10  Yes, he communicated very well.  Quite well.  good  Better  Dr. Huang communicated effectively",2017 Fall
537,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 6,"The notes were also very hard for me to get anything out of. They were confusing and I never felt like they led me anywhere. Just a bunch of information that was difficult to link together. It's like I missed a pre-req or something.  Sure  The content tended to be slides with unexplained equations with undefined variables, while the code given out as a base to do the projects with was entirely uncommented leading to an excessively long time working out what each part actually did.  In most cases I was unable to fully understand the code or why it worked.  I was able to change small parts of it but commenting what each part did would be really helpful, especially since we are expected to comment what our changes do.  Somewhat, he got extremely ahead of schedule which made the first midterm cover way too much material.  They were fairly well organized.  no comment  No. They jumped around. He would change subject constantly during lecture. This was another reason why people could not produce logical notes.  Sometimes difficult to follow.  To an extent. He had prepared notes, and knew exactly what he was talking about. Sometimes it was unorganized, but rarely.  Very well  A bit more explanation into fortran syntax would've been welcomed, but not absolutely necessary.

Again the grad student seemed to be in charge of all of that.  Yes. He even scheduled meetings on the weekends to help me understand things.  He held office hours.

I watched all the lecture videos until you stopped uploading them, but it was still hard for me to learn a damn thing. Seriously, it felt like I missed a pre-req.  Stop with the power point. It's awful. Write everything step by step. We are not all as smart as you are. Go slower.  Comment your code.  I don't care if you know what it does and what you're doing, I need to know what it does so I can complete the assignments.  Just because a project is simple doesn't mean its easy, that's why Prandtl is famous.  No  Please make using FORTRAN optional. I get it that compiler based languages can be very helpful to know, but we aren't taught that prior to the class and it puts students at a disadvantage and makes the course unreasonablely difficult for something that is not a key objective for an understanding of computational methods.  no comment  I understand that George Huang has Fortran code that he has published apparently, and this is why he uses it in class. However, as powerful and impressive as the code is, students can't read it, manipulate it, or understand it. 50% of our grade comes from doing exactly that. This class would be FAR more effective in teaching computational methods if it used Matlab. Perhaps Dr. Huang cannot use Matlab and so chooses not to teach with it. This class NEEDS to have someone look into what's going on. It needs to change. Many students feel threatened that they won't graduate because they can't interpret Fortran.  Students are not learning about the course subject. Why does WSU require a Matlab course (a numerical analysis program for mechanical engineers) when the Computational Methods and NUMERICAL ANALYSIS course used a completely different software? If the college is dead set on using this language, please require a course in using it. This class as it is run is, without a doubt, setting students up for failure.  Only two gripes: 1. TA should not be grading the exams 2. Record all lectures, even if using the whiteboard (the audio only would still be helpful to refresh memory).  This course is complex. I feel it should be strictly a graduate class. If this class must be a required course to graduate, it should not be so complex. This class seems like it should be the part 2 of a course, where the first part would be an introduction to Fortran, and simplified examples.  If possible recording the audio on the last group of lectures would still be helpful even though the majority of material was covered on the white boards. Having the recorded lectures proved very useful for both projects and exam review,  None  Students in the future should be allowed to use matlab, which the students understand, or Fortran should actually be taught  no  Yes, just want to inform that he should give and solve the examples in class after completion of the topic.  no  No  No.",2017 Fall

548,ME 7750,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 1,"She was very kind and always smiling, however, some of the concepts were a little abstract.  Sometimes she is vague in the lecture and then expects depth of understanding on the tests. It is hard to figure out what is important to understand for this class.  Effective, discussed relevant information for both the class and real world applications.

By referring me to read some other textbook and solving more questions that I wasn't indepthly taught during my undergraduate program.  On the very first day of class, after looking at the syllabus I was so scared because those concepts are so advanced and in depth.

She always responded very quickly for our queries through any medium like during office hours or email.,2017 Fall
563,ME 7760,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 8,"Great class!  she is one of the calm and very understanding teacher i have met in my life. thanks  She should pay more attention to helping students with clarifications during her office hours and not give the student an impression to feel scared of coming for her office hours because she will always refer the student back to the textbook, that way it looks as if the student didn't read it the first time before coming to her office for help.

She introduces concepts that are not required, but she knows are very relevant to real world applications.  Her depth of knowledge in the subject is very impressive.  Professor Mirmasoudi was very effective in class.  Shw was a very good instructor at teaching the concepts for the class.  She kept the large class on task and organized.  All of the concepts we taught effectively.  very good  SHE IS THE BEEEEEEST  Good Class, learned a lot.  The class is very effective and a lot of content is introduced.  Okay  Good.  The class material was clearly presented. Nothing was too repetitive, and things sped up as expected as the overall Solidworks skill level increased. The progression was very effective.  I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi did an excellent job of instructing this course as I was easily able to learn the material due to her teaching methods. Also, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class.  The overall effectiveness of this instructor was outstanding. She described every step she took and she would always make sure everyone was caught up and understanding what she was doing.  Her teaching style is very effective and helpful  She was very thorough and she was very helpful. she did everything she could to make sure that we understood what we were doing.  Very effective and full of information. Fantastic teacher!!!!  She was a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell she knew what she was talking about. She was typically very clear with instructions as we followed along, but sometimes she went too fast for people and we had to wait to let them catch up. The one part that she did not make as clear was the written portion of the class. We spent lots of time on the practical portion of the class, which is important and much more interesting, but not much time was spent on learning or reviewing the symbols and markings which are very important.",2017 Fall

This is what kept my interest.  by helping us whenever we needed it  Yes  Mrs. Mirmasoudi was helpful and understanding. However, she was strict. Her interest in learning is seen in her lectures.  Being excited about content.  Yes.  The instructor personally checked on the different stages of the chair project, and also asked questions regarding learning progression throughout the semester.  If a student was having any issues with a certain topic, she would make sure to go back over that material to ensure that everyone was learning it, and these issues were alleviated.  She always asked if everyone was caught and always asked if everyone was understanding what she was doing.  She would continuously ask if everyone was caught up and working well  The class itself was very interesting so it was easy to pay attention.

She was very good teaching and explaining tasks and due dates and often emailed to clarify due dates, explain tasks further,  or answer problems that arose.  very well  Yes  Yes  Very well.  Communication was the only area early on that was somewhat lacking. There were a few deadlines that were different in class versus on pilot, and the sample report was never posted. This led to some less than ideal grades on early assignments. But later in the semester, communication was effective.  As previously stated, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. That included the timely reply of emails and then communicating the content of these emails without saying who emailed her, to ensure that no other students were having the same issues and if so to address these with them as well.  She was great at answering questions in class and also emails whenever someone had a question out of class.  Very effectively.

571,ME 1040,Sara Mirmasoudi,Question 8,"no  Overall a very good professor, she is a little difficult, but I fell like a learned more than the other class on solidworks applications. I would recommend her to beginner engineers looking to learn a lot and who are passionate about the field.  Maybe have dimension sheets or follow along sheets for students while teaching a lesson they can see things without having the teacher go back and re-explain and take extra time, or the student get lost and fall behind because they missed some dimesnions when they were fixing a problem or touched a wrong button.  Also some students do not have drafting and CAD experience and the class takes off pretty fast assuming everyone has the experience.  no  No  Mrs. Mirmasoudi warmed up to the class after a few weeks. Her teaching style is very immersive and benefits students in the industry,  No.  I would have loved to cover more material with the implementation of a much faster pace, although I understand why this would be a difficult addition. I like more intense material, otherwise tend to focus on other classes, which is why the most difficult design tasks were my best grades. So an intense lecture covering a large amount of materiel would be perfect for students like me.  I felt that Mrs. Mirmasoudi not only taught me how to use SolidWorks, but also how to utilize it for resumes, interviews and future careers. With that being said, I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi went above and beyond what was required of her in order to teach this course.  She always cared about making sure we fully understand what she did and always wanted us to learn more.  no.  Fantastic Teacher!!!!!",2017 Fall

This is the sort of treatment that I joined the RCL program to see. As far as areas for possible improvement go, it seemed that the course pacing was a bit uneven, with lots of extra time spent on a couple of chapters, as compared with the syllabus, and a couple of chapters left uncovered. One change to speed up the early material would be reducing the time spent coaching the use of Excel. There are many numerical tools out there and graduate students should be expected to bring a toolbox with them to a 7000-level class.  However, I expect that Dr. Menart is drawing on previous experience here and perhaps the coaching is necessary. One compromise might be some video instruction on Pilot that the students could access outside of class.  I shall definitely look forward for my future courses with Dr. Menart.  no  Nope, he's the best!",2017 Fall

622,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Very strong.  The professor had respect for students and was open for questions at all times.  He provided good examples and definitely challenged students in thinking about how to solve problems.  need more examples of problems in class with numbers  It is a hard subject to teach, and I think he did a good job of trying  Your subject is really difficult, so when students get an average of 60% on the exam, it is because you didnt ever do practice problems on the topics. we get bad grades on homework that is not relevant and is far more complex than test material. additionally, with no numbers on tests, only variables, its impossible to do well unless we have swallowed your format of doing things. thats not learning, that is learning how to pass your exams.  Doesn't teach from the textbook which is a waste. Uses completely different methods from the book, so you don't have any reference material besides the notes.  Explanations and example were gone through very quickly though the instructors always stopped for questions.  I think he does a really good job on being clear with explanations, handling questions, and having the students think.  The teaching style is great using notes and handouts which allow for a better understanding. I feel there needs to be more examples covered rather than the theory to help explain how to use the theory in a variety of ways. He answered all of the questions that were asked very well there was just not many questions asked mainly for the fact that I believed if you were confused in the class yu would not know how to ask a question to make it more clear.  This was a very challenging course. The lectures were well organized and the handouts were helpful for keeping example problems organized.  My main complaint about the course is the homework. I understand that assigning homework more difficult than the exam aids in helping you think more about the topic and the problem-solving processes. However, the sheer difficulty of these homework problems was a little ridiculous at times and I do not feel it prepared me for the exams simply because of the differences in difficulty. Yes, it was clarified at the beginning of the semester that studying the homework was not a good way to prepare for the exams, but that still makes the homework a little less helpful overall. I am glad that old midterm materials were provided for studying. That was extremely helpful.  Very clear, told exactly what you needed for the class  Overall the class was difficult. I believe he could explained the material better than just the theory aspect of the course. He did not seem to care to help the students after exams scores were reviewed. He just stated ""we were the worse class he has had"" but has done nothing different to prepare for the final exam.  NEVER USED NUMBERS. I get it, you can better generalize the problem with variables, but were engineers.  We need numbers sometimes too.  Took so many notes!  My hand felt like it was going to fall off by the end of class.  Instructor presented content and examples clearly; questions were handled quickly, effective and it appeared with enthusiasm; applications of the content were elaborated as to arose interest and identify objective, this was effective in stimulating thought; instructor was respectful.  The few examples that were portrayed were unclear to me and there was too much time spent on deriving equations when practical problems could have been done  He seemed to do pretty well on all these bases. Examples were always relevant and pretty helpful.  Examples were very specific and often times hard to apply outside of class. Material taught in class should be less derivation and more application.  Philippe Sucosky handled questions very well and provided us with good notes that were well outlined. He was always focused on presenting the material so he was neither respective, nor irrespective of students (which is how it should be as his job is to teach us)  He was very good at giving examples and explaining the concepts of everything.  The homework was pointless to do because it was impossible to relate to the exams, the only reason to do it was because of the weight it has on your final grade. The exams were brutal and the first exam very little study material and background knowledge on what was expected was poorly laid out. The second exam he provided 5+ exam solutions so we could study them, but had no solutions to them so knowing whether or not your answer was right was impossible to tell.  He did answer questions well, but often exam scores were followed with ridicule because the class had failed to demonstrate the knowledge of a subject that he has so seriously made more difficult.  He taught pretty well, but sometimes it was very hard to process what was going on because we went through the material so fast.  He did not seem very respectful to his students. He is very arrogant and rude, and he treated us like we were all stupid.  I thought Dr. Sucosky was very effective in his teaching. He took the time to walk, step-by-step, through example problems to make sure the students understood what was being asked, and what values/variables meant to obtain a better understanding of the material.  I know that this guy knows what he is talking about, but he seriously does not stop talking from the moment class starts, until it ends. I was not aware that someone can multitask to the point where they can be saying one thing and writing down another. Very hard to keep up with him in his lectures and nobody knows what is going on so nobody can really ask a question  Very clear, concise, and well versed when teaching this subject. Master of Fluid Dynamics.  Did a great job explaining the concepts of problems and general equations. Answered all questions asked with full explanation every time  Very good  Good clarity.  Would be better if more examples were used for each type of problem.  When answering direct questions often the instructor would give vague, and unhelpful answers.  Mr. Sucosky was very clear on presenting topics, though the accent was different for the first 3 weeks. The handouts he provided were very clear and helped immensely. He was constantly challenging us to do better. He treated everyone with respect, even if they did not treat him with it.  He provides everything you need for his exams and homework. The handouts are directly correlated with homework and he provides enough exam examples to get a grasp on how to solve the problems. Homework is more difficult and lengthy than most courses assignments but if you can do the homework, you can take his exams.  Dr. Sucosky appeared to be doing his best to teach a very difficult subject.  He was very clear. If there was any kind of confusion you could always ask him questions and he would clarify as much as he could.  He goes over the lecture notes a little too fast",2017 Fall
623,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 12,"Dr. Sucosky answers questions well but does so condescendingly. He doesn't seem approachable although once you get passed the intimidation, he is very helpful.  The instructor was very helpful in helping me understand the material. The professor would be very helpful during office hours and would encourage people to ask questions.  somewhat, lecture went so fast couldnt do anything but just copy the notes  yes  No, he doesn't demonstrate enough examples to practice for the exams.  Gave many real world examples. Would provide handouts for hard to understand concepts.  Yeah he would in office hours when he would write on the board and give explanations.  Yes, he used multiple real world examples which gets you more interested and involved in the class such as showing examples of how a wind tunnel is used and also different real world programs  Yes. Lectures were well organized. I liked the handout system for example problems. It is easy to keep the examples separated from the theory notes.  Yes  No, I have had to rely on the textbook to help me understand the material and groups of friends working together to pass the course.  no. When midterms were taken he proceeded to tell us that we are the worst class that he has ever had and that we gave no effort, and that is why the class average was a 60!  NO BUDDY, THATS ON YOU.  Says he will not curve the grades. BUT HALF OF THE CLASS HAS A GRADE OF A ""D"" OR BELOW.  Sucosky look in the mirror, the problem is a little bit more than you just having dumb kids.  Yes.  I thing he tried to make the class easier but through my mind his way of teaching just made things harder  Gave relevant examples and was available during office hours.  Teacher was always available for email and office hours.  Yes and no. The big problem I have with this class was the difficulty of the homework. I understand and appreciate the need for difficult homework, however I don't believe homework should be exclusively difficult. Rather, we should work up to more difficult problems. By doing only hard problems, the foundation for solving problems is not established. If homework is where the real learning is supposed to happen then more emphasis should be put on the learning process. On the other hand, I believe the tests were very fair and well made.  He made the textbook redundant. The lectures were essentially a more understandable and digestible version of the textbook, making his lectures invaluable.  he was available via email and office hours  Yes. Everything I learned in this class came from his handouts and our in-class notes.  Yes, Dr. Sucosky was available during his office hours to answer specific questions or explain concepts not well understood during lecture. He was very patient and would aid in my understanding of the material during his office hours.  Negative ghost rider. I was treated like an idiot who was not worth his time and then he would answer my question out of pure annoyance and pity.  Yes, he was very clear and concise with his teaching. He was able to answer any questions on the subject as he knew the material inside and out.  Yes. He always answered questions well and went into extra detail where students normally make mistakes.  Yes, by giving full depth explanations into the concepts of the general equations and answering all questions when students were confused  Yes, always provided good examples  Yes, but understanding material for the homework and exams were very difficult.  I did not find the format of the class very helpful. Most of the questions we used were all symbolic with very few numbers or simplification. For example the Navier Stokes examples never used any numbers. Instead the integrations and equations ended up extremely complicated.  He did aid in my understanding. He would answer any questions I had. I met with him multiple times during his office hours.  Yes.  Yes he helped as much as he could. He was very helpful in office hours and in class. I went to him in his office hours almost every week sometimes twice a week and he was always helpful. He wouldn't just outright give you the answer he would make sure you understood where your mistake was and how to fix it. Homework was challenging, but all of the homework he gave was real-life applications. The real-life application kept me interested and helped me to have an idea of why i was learning fluid dynamics.",2017 Fall
624,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 13,"Professor Sucosky did a great job of explaining material and challenging students. His expectations were straight forward and he was willing to help in any way possible. A tough professor, but one that is willing to help in and out of the classroom.  nothing  I gave a 'D' for my response regarding the materials contributing to my learning for this reason: on the exams we were directly told not to study the hw, or the book, because they were overly complex. But studying only the notes was not quite effective because they were overly simplified. This setup made things difficult and stressful, but feel like I learned fluids.  I liked him, but at times he can be a little intimidating in his office hours.  Regarding the homework comments above: What I would have found extremely helpful was one problem on each homework assignment that is similar to the style we would see on an exam. I gladly would have done an additional problem on each assignment if I knew it was going to help me prepare for what I might see on an exam.  I appreciate the old midterm material being provided for us, but the only problem with that is that you do not have the solutions, so you don't really have a way of checking your solutions aside from asking the instructor, which can be inconvenient if 60 students are asking to check work on 5 old midterms with 3 problems each. By putting an exam-style problem on the homework, we could check our solutions to at least one of these problems since the homework solutions are posted weekly anyway.  hard class, no numbers in class or in exams. Does not explain anything in detail.  Homework is crazy hard.  none  none  While the examples and discussions of the concepts were all excellent, the only complaint I have is the complete lack of any numerical problem. While this is likely due to the incredibly theoretical nature of the course, it could have been helpful to see a few numerical problems.  At the beginning of the semester, he showed us a couple of previous course evaluations that stated that this class was hard and the homework was unnecessarily difficult. He told us that he did not like seeing these statements on the course evaluations, because he gives difficult homework on purpose.  Despite the fact that he does this on purpose and doesn't like seeing this, I'm going to say it anyway. The homework in this class unnecessarily hard, and it takes way too long. I honestly believe that these homework assignments did more harm than they did good; they left everyone confused, and most everyone in the class used websites like Chegg to solve the problems.  He needs to do a far better job at explaining how to do problems instead of doing nothing but theory for an hour and a half.  No comment  I really enjoyed the class. With a clear lecture and guided handouts, the class was easy to follow and engaging  The class was very well organized. I never thought i had wasted time in his class. The material is very challenging, but he gives enough examples to help you understand the subject. He was always willing to help you during office hours, class or outside of class through email. He was very frustrated when students were not understanding the material and not letting him know. During this class i felt as though i was responsible for my grade. Every grade that i received good or bad i earned. He gave plenty of examples and extra problems and was very clear about what was expected of you on the exams. He did not use pilot and quite frankly i thought the format was better. He would send out emails about your grade every week; as a result i was never unclear about what my grade was. Overall, I would definitely take him again for another class.",2017 Fall
625,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 14,"For the help of future students, providing the solutions of past exams would help students learn more. Furthermore, the consideration of time and understanding of how tough some homework sets were, would be helpful. At some points, hours would be spent on a homework set, which would cause more stress than understanding of the material.  Overall, great and helpful professor. He was willing to help and definitely challenges students through those homework problems. He is definitely willing to help students learn.  none  Very professional, which is appreciated  stop using old final exam problems as homeworks, this is why students either cheat on HW or do poorly  If he went over more examples and provided more solutions to practice exams, the class would be easier to study for considering he doesn't use the textbook. He would be a much better professor if we had more to study and learn from.  While I wouldn't go back to an open note open book exam, I do think a crib sheet is helpful to both exam performance and student learning as it forces the student to comprehend the material and lay it out in a limited space.  Very well taught class but I would have preferred a greater variety of examples for each subject to understand the problems better.  If I had a choice between him and another professor I would not take him again and several of my peers would agree to that statement.  His main focus is research and the theory behind everything. Not problems we would use at a manufacturing company.  The instructor addressed his french accent as being comical. He was correct. Also, he enunciated sufficiently to be easily understood.  I thought Dr. Sucosky was an effective professor and I would not mind taking him again for another class.  Sucosky is an exemplary teacher and knows what he is doing. If there is room for improvement, its making the homework more directly related to what is learned in class, or to focus on the principles and equations of the course instead of their derivations.  Looking forward to taking him for Heat Transfer now that I know how his class functions  This was one of the first semesters that Dr. Sucosky didn't let his students use notes on the tests. He said that this would help us to get better grades. Then, when we got our first exam back, he told us that we were one of the worst performing classes he had ever seen. Then, when we got our second exam back, his exact words were, ""This is the worst I have seen since I've been teaching Fluid Mechanics."" I think it should be very obvious to him that the reason for our poor performance is that we were not given the same privileges as his previous classes. Hopefully in the future, he will either let his students use their notes again, or at least make their exams easier if they are not allowed to use their notes.  I learned a lot from this class and understand the material very well. The homework was challenging but also allowed for deeper understanding of the material.  His homeworks might as well have been a weekly exam that you were getting no help with.  None  I think we should have homework from the book. It would have helped to have some mandatory homework that was easy so I could get some confidence in the subject. I think there should have been more examples in class and some examples with numbers(I understand that this would be hard with this subject) Needed to engage the class more ( Ask us questions more frequently, Show us more videos or images that stimulate our interest and get us to ask questions). He did very well at explaining the material clearly and consistently. I did like writing the notes out in class but sometimes moved too fast and I couldn't follow along (just mindlessly writing down notes)  Thank you for a great semester.  Very blunt so there is no confusion as to what you need to be able to do to pass his course. Lectures are very well structured and there is no confusion as to what needs to be done. Class time is always used to its fullest with providing the student information. Not much time for questions but material is provided in a very orderly fashion that doesn't really raise any questions until trying to complete homework, which you can go to his office hours for any clarification.  His accent is pretty sweet.  I just don't think that he respects the undergraduate students at all and looks down on us. In his office hours there is hostility, and he gets pissed if you don't understand something: ""this really isn't hard material"". He also doesn't dedicate his office hours to the students that come in, and works on his research while you ask him for help. He gives you a response, and then doesn't care if you are still stuck. He just wants to get you out of there as soon as possible, no patience. Almost every response to a question is answered condescendingly. I have had an A in his class up to this point in the semester, so it's not like I'm a bad student either for him to be treating me this way. A lot of students aren't doing good in the class, and I feel like him being so hostile has prevented people that need help from asking him. If i have a 95 average for the first two exams, and he treats me like an idiot, then I can only image how he treats the students that are failing who understand the material much less than I do.",2017 Fall

636,ME 3360,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Dr. Sucosky has a very unique style of teaching, compared to the other engineering professors. He was willing to give out handouts that simplified complex problems.  Dr Sucosky taught this class as if all of his students were experts in Heat Transfer. If a student went to his office hours for consultation, he would say that if you didn't understand you would fail the class. He is a smart person and a good professor, he just seemed to not always assist students who didn't grasp concepts immediately.  Very very very good. Great professor  He's very good at stopping to explain if people have questions.  Very clear explanations. Kind of disrespectful. The class average on the first exam was about a 55%, and rather than acknowledge that maybe he didn't sufficiently prepare us, he basically said it was sad we didn't know how to do better. I didn't think that was appropriate. He wasn't helpful in answering questions and usually didn't give enough nudge in the right direction to even know where to begin.  the teacher was very organized he had everything set up for the students to learn the material conceptually and do problems to learn it mathemeatically  Good notes  Extraordinarily organized.  His notes were outstanding and well organized.  He provided examples in class that defined the process by which we could use to solve the homework problems which were always challenging and stimulating.  He always shows respect for all the students and is readily available to answer questions.  Dr. Sucosky is an excellent instructor and knows the material that his is teaching.  His notes are outstanding and something that I will always keep for reference.  Dr. Sucosky is an organized professor, providing many notes, examples, and other materials for learning.  Overall the instructor did a fairly good job with the class since it was his first time teaching the course. There were a couple of mistakes in the handouts and lectures which caused some confusion on one of the tests but otherwise he did a very good job.

The University is fortunate to have an instructor of Dr. Sucosky's caliber.  I have 150 undergraduate hours (BSAAE), 30 graduate hours in engineering (MSAE) and 60 graduate hours in business (MBA).  Dr. Sucosky ranks as one of the best four instructors that I have had the privilege of sitting in his lectures.  His teaching skills and subject knowledge are outstanding.  Overall fairly good job. One suggestion I have is to upload all the notes at the begging of the semester so students can print of the handouts ahead of time instead of having to print them off before class every time. In addition, I wish homework assignment could be done in pencil or ink instead of just ink because if you make a mistake I usually had to completely rewrite the mistake or else the assignment looked messy and unprofessional. Again these are just suggestions on how to make the course better because I believe in continuous improvement. Again I want to reiterate the instructor overall did a pretty good job.  Great professor, encourages students to work hard and learn.  Changes could be made to the homeworks. The level of difficulty on the homework was way beyond what was learned in class.

650,ME 4330,Zifeng Yang,Question 11,"Dr. Yang did a very good job explaining the mathematical concepts behind compressible flow. I do feel like he could have done a little more to engage the class and stimulate conceptual thinking among the students instead of focusing more on derivations.  he was passionate about the course and was able to explain the topics in an understandable manner  Difficulty of the material of this course ranged dramatically. A lot of the class was derivation of equations which was redundant and unnecessary at time. Usually, 30 minutes of class time could be boiled down to an equation in the book that was boxed in and could easily be referenced.  What would be far more helpful is explaining the physical significance of an equation. This was done sometimes, but I feel like a lot of class time was not well spent. This is possibly why material was consistently rushed out before exams.  Class notes were relevant and examples were explained well.  He's a pretty good teacher. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and has personal experience is the area. He accepted questions and would do his best to work through the answer. He likes to stand in front of what he is writing on the board so it can be difficult to see what he's writing sometimes.  Everythng is good  He was so responsive and perfect in all, mentioned above  The bonus quizzes were very helpful.",2017 Fall
651,ME 4330,Zifeng Yang,Question 12,"Yes,  yes. he asked questions as he explained lecture to emphasize the key points  Aid? Yes as far as reading the book is an aid. Reciting the very thing the book is saying isn't helpful. Yes, teaching is basically doing exactly that, but effective teaching makes the message easier to digest. This class didn't do that. However, the examples done in class were definitely valuable. I wish more time was spent on examples than equation derivation.  Yes. Also is now allowing for recitation classes before the final  Yes.

664,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 11,"He really understands the course and the material being taught. Goes into great detail on the important components of the course and doesn't spend much time going over things already taught in the past. Overall, great instructor.  Class notes were relevant, examples were helpful. Book problems were more skewed toward being theoretical and less like what appeared on exams.  Very clear with lectures  Class notes were posted online which was great  He is very knowledgeable on the subject. There were several occasions through the semester when he would make corrections to the text book because they had derived an equation wrong. Maybe a new book would help. There were a lot of corrections.  Instructor was cleared with his subjects. He used different practical examples for better understanding of subject. He repeated ask students if they had question and was catering to each question in a polite manner.  Everything was great.  CLARITY OF EXPLANATION :  1. Professor used well organised class notes to explain us .  2. He had uploaded all notes on pilot well in advance .so when I started with this course, I had all required material wit me well in advance..  3. He writes each and every steps on the white board to explain which indeed helped me know the procedure well.  4. He gives more time to students to grasp and understand. At the end of the class ,he takes QUIZ. This method is best in two ways. In the first, it keeps us alert always . Secondly it helps us improve our grades. 5. He solves many examples in the class to make us understand.  HANDLING OF QUESTIONS: 1. He tries his best to handle all our doubts i the classroom. If he cannot, he goes back and then the next day he does it without fail.  2. I approached him many times during his work hours for doubts, He cleared all my doubts . 3. He responds immediately to our mails and solves our problems. SIMULATION OF THINKING: 1. He gives quiz problems at the end of the class which keeps us alert and keep thinking on the problems and concepts. This helps to develop thinking process 2. He gives Take home Projects. This helps us to learn the concepts, learn new software (I learnt MATLAB while doing the project) as well as we get acquainted to the paper presentation technique and writing a technical paper RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL: 1. He respects all individuals and treats all students equally  Dr. Yang is a very thorough professor when it comes to learning. He kept in class quizes to monitor the performances of students and it proved to be very helpful. The projects which he gave were challenging and it helped to get a better knowledge about the course.  yes, professor Zifang yang's lecture were well organised, his clarity of explanations and examples are awesome, even he has good thinking ability and respect for individuals and their differences.  Professor has an exceptionally good teaching style that helped me to learn each topics easily..  I think there are a lot of issues with this course and how it's presented. Starting with the materials we are required to purchase, the book is not only ten years old but is completely wrong on most equations. Before we begin a chapter, the instructor has to go through the text with us and correct each mistake. This is made worse by the fact that these corrections are not posted on the website, meaning that if you happened to miss that particular day, or make an improper correction, you are at a disadvantage. The notes that Dr. Yang posts to the website, in my opinion, offer nothing to the course as they are literally just the text from the book copied word-for-word. There might be a few expanded steps on derivations listed, but this not very helpful. The variables used in each chapter may, or may not, mean different things and they are hardly ever introduced clearly. There are a lot of issues with the book and notes, and they need to be addressed. The biggest issue, however, is the way the material is presented. Essentially, it's just copied from the book/notes with no real application presented. The equations are derived, and he tries his best to explain the process used, but when it actually comes to using the equations listed to solve for a physical quantity, there is no help. This makes the homework very difficult as most of the time students are unsure of what is actually being solved for. When it is solved, we are unsure of what the quantity represents. I was challenged by the difficulty in the homework, but only so in finding ways to solve it. Not actually in critical analysis and thought, which is what the engineer is supposed to do.  He is overall good  Bonus quizzes were helpful in maintaining concentration.",2017 Fall
665,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 12,"Yes, he provided a great explanation of the material, examples when necessary, and would quiz us periodically to see how we understood what was going on.  Answered questions and gave examples in a way that was easy to understand  Yes, always put solutions online after homeworks were turned in  yes  Instructor gave practical examples and also shared his research work for better understanding of the subject. During office hours, he was always available for help regarding subject.  Yes instructor used to give good examples during class to understand this subject well.  1. He gives quiz problems at the end of the class which keeps us alert and keep thinking on the problems and concepts. This helps to develop thinking process 2. He gives Take home Projects. This helps us to learn the concepts, learn new software (I learnt MATLAB while doing the project) as well as we get acquainted to the paper presentation technique and writing a technical paper 3. He writes each and every steps on the white board to explain which indeed helped me know the procedure well. 4. He solves many examples in the class to make us understand.  5. He shares additional materials, site details and papers with us for our additional information  Dr> yang was always available for doubts during his office hours and in class. Also he used to help me via emails.  Yes he aided my understanding for this subject very well.  Yes he did aid in my understanding about this subject by challenging us in quizzes by giving various problems on different important topics..  In a way, the instructor inspired me to learn most of the difficult concepts on my own, which led me to a more solid understanding. However, no expansion was given on the material presented in the text. I know that equations were derived, but I have no idea which ones are applicable to which state. The homework, which is supposed to help the students understand the applications of the text, only further confused us as we could not really apply what was learned in class, and instead had to look elsewhere for answers. The Joukowski airfoil project that we were required to do was also confusing in what it was trying to teach; was this a project to test the students' ability to code correctly (may be beneficial to post a MATLAB code with key equations left out so that the student may concentrate on concepts learned in class), understand concepts in the text that were not thoroughly explained, see how the joukowski transformation works, or to see who understood aerodynamic principles? The midterm exam was also unfair; Dr. Yang introduced a problem that has never been assigned in homework, barely discussed in class, and made it worth 40% of the overall grade. When asked about this, he said in class that this was how he identified the ""good"" students from the ""bad"" students. I, personally, can understand giving a trick problem on an exam to see how the students will react to it, but I would not make it the most important problem.  Somewhat agree  yes.",2017 Fall
666,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 13,Not necessary.  No additional comments  No  He spent three class periods talking about CFD/his research which caused the discussion of turbulent flows to be cut short. This is frustrating because we have multiple other classes that discuss CFD but no other classes that cover turbulent flows in depth.  No further comments  Overall instructor taught this subject really well.  1.Very considerate and student friendly towards students.  2. He sees and considers the hard work of students and helps them to improve the grades by giving bonus quiz's and additional bonus question in main exam 3. He is at the same time very strict and does not tolerate cheating or plagiarism which is very good. Because if a professor let goes plagiarism then this will be injustice towards hard working students 4. He treats all students equally  His teaching is good he got good notes for this subject and best knowledge. 9 out of 10.  He is a good and knowledgeable professor who is having an expert teaching skill sets...  He is good instructuer,2017 Fall
667,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 14,"None.  No additional comments  No  No additional comments  No, additional comments.  No  Dr. Yang is a brilliant researcher, and the presentations he gave us over his work show that he is very knowledgeable in the field of fluid dynamics. I truly believe, however, that he may want to reconsider how this course is taught and what the educational goals are. If I had one recommendation moving forward, it would be to change the textbook used in class.  Have you considered writing your own advanced fluids book, or trying to find an open-source textbook? (Something like https://openstax.org/). I ask because you seem to have practically done half of the work already, and it is not comforting to start each chapter by correcting major mistakes in the textbook.",2017 Fall

678,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 11,"Nikolai's lectures were okay, it was mostly just powerpoint presentations or super long examples. He didn't do a great job explaining some things  Examples were very helpful and he always wanted us working together and helping each other think through problems.  I liked how he worked out tons of example problems step by step  Mr. Priezjev has a very simple and effective form of lecturing. His slides take all the material in the book and show what is most important and needed. He gives and works lots of examples that help with the homework and in understanding the material.  I feel like his examples were confusing because he would randomly change variables. It was just really hard to follow some of his examples.  very clear and good  He wasn’t super clear when doing examples in class. I felt the class lectures weren’t very relevant to the test material. He didn’t really make me want to learn considering he would have verbal quizzes that we couldn’t use calculators on and he never explained the answers well at all. Class lectures were typically very boring PowerPoint slides when I find its most effective to do example problems instead.  Would answer any questions.  He tries to explain at his best, since i was lost in one of the lectures, it was very difficult to c=get along all through the entire semester. his homework are too difficult.  Nikolai is a great professor. He gives plenty of example problems to explain how dynamics work. I'm sure I would have learned a lot if I paid attention.  Examples were good. Some of the material was just like looking at a different language some times. Derivations were done so quick that even asking for where certain pieces came from I was left confused after an explanation. Mid lecture quizzes gave some level of extra reinforcement of concepts.  the lectures were clear and focused. I appreciate the time and effort he put into this class.",2017 Fall
679,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 12,"Kind of. As I said before, he did not really do a great job explaining the steps of completing some problems, he just put his work on the board without explaining a lot.  yes, made new material like circular motion very understandable by using physics and statics explanations.  yes he is willing to answer questions and re explain concepts  Yes, he gave tons of examples and also solutions to help in general understanding and study. I never felt under prepared for exams or homework because all that I needed was taught well.  I feel like he helped my understanding, but class led to a lot of confusion and I had clean up the mess after class.  yes learned a  lot about motion and calculations to further my knowledge  Not really  NA.  yes  He gives plenty of example problems and explains concepts well during lecture. He will stop and give more explanation if it seems the class doesn't understand something.  I think I have a better understanding of how a lot of things work.

680,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 13,"Nikolai's homework assignments were the hardest problems that he could find, but when it came time to take the exam, the problems were extremely easy. He is a very lenient grader, also.  I like his style of teaching  Speaks great good and clear English. Very fair, very smart, and very respectable. Overall an awesome professor in my opinion.  I found that I was more confused in class that anything. He would go back and forth saying how easy something is and then how difficult it is, so its like he doesn't even know how difficult it is. He tried to teach math off of PowerPoint, but his implementation wasn't good. I just didn't come out learning as much as I was hoping. I felt like I learned more about this subject from physics.  very good teacher  I liked being able to use a crib sheet on exams because in the real world I would have resources available to me anyway and a lot of professors don’t get that. I REALLY didn’t agree with him keeping exams in a folder and having the class pass it around to dig theirs out. That is a complete invasion of academic privacy because everyone would know how every single person in the class did on the exam. Hand them out instead by calling up students one by one or write the grade on the inside of the exam.  NA.  if I had more to say I would have already said it.",2017 Fall

He seemed to be taking examples straight from the book and working through them for us. This is an effective method of learning for me, however, it is also a very dry method of learning. It wasn't fun at all.  Very clear conveyance. Answered questions clearly and effectively.  His notes were the best I have ever seen from any professor! Very neat handwriting, super easy to follow. He made even the hard problems look easy by explaining every step and involving the class in discussions of how best to solve the problem.  He kept the whole class stimulated by keeping a brisk pace. And writing down alot of stuff  Very well laid out lectures that were heavy on example. Class time was never wasted. Occasionally did not seem to understand a specific question about an example, but eventually got to the answer. Very good at describing a process of thinking that would apply to many different problems  Dr. Li is a great teacher who is able to explain Statics very well through key points and specific examples. He is also very kind and showed equality to all students present within the classroom.  Effective lectures and exams  Handled questions well.  Made class extremely boring not motivating students at all.  Would skip through several steps of problems which is ok sometimes.  But others it would be crucial cause he would say just apply the same principles but it is still different and it hurt our learning.  I enjoyed professor Li's teaching and enjoyed being in his classroom for every class.  The instructor was very good at presenting material in a consistent, clear an effective manner, showing a process then how to apply the process in a variety of problems. Handled examples and questions very well.  Grading was fair and the class was clearly laid out - no unfair surprises.  Good on all those, gave great examples. Sometimes didn't understand peoples questions straight away, but wasn't often.  ineffective at teaching.  Poor examples were given in class and no explanation was given as to why we did anything except solve.  examples rarely related to the difficulty of the homework  He didn’t do a great job at explaining he would do an example for each section of the chapter but not invite discussion or questions therefor leaving many students confused. There was no excitement on the subject which in return gave no excitement to students to learn the material.

The teacher didn't aid in my understanding of Statics, he created my understanding of statics.  Yes. The lectures he gave were consistent with the exams and homework. His notes were very helpful when trying to understand the procedure to problem solving. When doing homework I could follow the steps he gave for solving and get the problem right. He also gave solutions to the homework questions.  Yes, he asked questions about our comprehension often  yes; her taught processes for solving problems that can apply to many different types of problems which was very helpful  Yes, for example, people in the class would ask questions about the material and he would stop the whole lecture and work out a completely new problem for the sake of the confused individual(s).  Well I didn't know anything about structural analysis going into the course and now I do, so I say he did a good job.  Somewhat.  Had to teach myself a lot.  Yes, very detailed about the subject that was needed and great examples.  Yes, the Dr. Li provided many examples similar to the exam/homework.  For each topic he would lay out a process to solve the problem, then solve multiple examples balancing instruction with student input.  Examples were clear and clearly written.

Very clear and many examples  Very good at explaining concepts and using relevant examples to further illustrate concepts  Excellent instructor. Very organized and coherent notes. Uses multiple boards in one class period. Expects the same from every student and lays out exactly what is expected.  x  Was clear when explaining topics and going through concepts  Examples were clear and aided in learning the material. Homework problems were enough to help practice material without being overwhelming for someone who works and goes to school which is rare in a grad class.  his teaching is good.  The overall experience with Dr. Li was amazing. His teaching is very beneficial and I got to learn a lot from this course. The examples which he used to solve in class were very helpful. Also he encouraged a lot of interaction in class.  Dr. Li has an exceptionally good teaching style that helped me to learn each topics easily..  Dr.Li is a good teacher and student friendly. He always provides his time to make students understand the concept. He consider all the students in the class as equal and helps everyone during the class as well as in office hours. He is good at handling multiple types of questions from students for any particular problem.  Dr. Li has demonstrated the subject really well. He took his time make sure he covered all topics on time gave proper well defined examples for each and every other topic and clarified all the doubts raised in the class. He was even available during office hours and explained what ever doubts were raised. He even provided additional office hours so as to make more time for us and clarify any questions raised.  There was a great clarity in his explanations and also the relevant examples given by him. The questions asked in the tests were kind of challenging and interesting. The tests helped us to think more the coursework, to get prepared for the out of the box questions.",2017 Fall
721,ME 7100,Sheng Li,Question 12,"Yes. Worked with me during office hours. answered questions during class clearly and if I did something wrong explained why and how to fix it.  yes he did. every topic had a good example provided in which the fundamentals were explained. Was very effective in teaching this subject  He made sure to be clear and write his notes on the board in an organized and thoughtful manner  Yes.

Yes, office hours were a huge help with homework problems and understanding of material.  Yes, always available through email and office hours  Yes, his method of lectures, homework, and quizzes were very effective. I felt like the subject matter was more broken up and manageable to learn; It was much better and less stressful than an exam system.  Yes, very helpful in office hours. Class periods were used well, the book could be better, but it was still a good tool.  x  Yes provided plenty of office hours  Yes, examples were usually used when developing equations for use in the class. Later examples demonstrated more complex problems while still being simple enough to gain a basic understanding of the material before attempting the homework.  yes when ever I am not able to understand he explains with an example related to that.  Yes. I would say Dr. Li helped me more than 100 %  He was always there to clear all my doubts whether it be in class or during the office hours.  Yes he did aid in my understanding about this subject by challenging us in quizzes by giving various problems on different important topics..

He make sure every one understood the topic and use to explain them with various examples for better understanding.  Yes, Dr Li made us to understand the concepts with great clarity. The 3D and 2D stress calculations, Castigliano's theorem, the axisymmetric problems were explained with relevant real life examples.",2017 Fall
722,ME 7100,Sheng Li,Question 13,He had multiple quizzes instead of a couple big exams. This was a much better system because of the amount of material being covered it would have been very difficult to craft an exam that would have fit in a 1 hour and 50 minute time block  None  Excellent professor with clear guidelines set at beginning of semester  Great professor  I liked how the professor recognized an issue with cheating and took care of it. The students that are dedicated and motivated to learn the subject will not be affected because they were honestly taking the course to begin with.  x  The only thing that made the class unnecessarily more difficult was the changing of rules for the quiz and how quiz problems were selected. This was less the fault of Dr. Li though than it was of some students in the class.  his correction is strict.  Dr Li is a good and knowledgeable who is having an expert teaching skill sets...  Dr.Li explains certain problems. Which will be helpful in solving any critical problems of same kind. The question in the exam were challenging and can be solved easily by students who follow his class.  Dr. Li make sure he used utilized the class timings and covered every other topic on time and evaluated the work really well. conducting the quiz were actually helpful because he make sure he covered every other topic for all the quiz.,2017 Fall

Overall very good professor who truly cares about the students learning.  I enjoyed this class. It was well structured to my understanding. Good class to take as a first 7000 level class. Sheng Li gave us a lot of opportunities to get points to help with our grades. Office hours were very flexible. Recommend taking this class with this instructor.  No  I would like to see professor Li teach FEA or a higher level design class. He is very good at communicating to students.  x  No comments  My personal experience with Dr.Li is, he is a good person. All he wants is that students to learn the concept and he clearly explains how to approach a particular problem and made me confident in solving a problem when i approached him. He also helps in improving the grades if he loses some in previous exam by providing additional office hours for the students.",2017 Fall

We already have enough to think about and try and work through. Deciding whether or not you are trying to yank our feet from under us with stupid trick questions and stuff just frustrates us and makes us angry at you.  awesome prof  Much better than last semester, had much better organization and exam topics were much clearer  Handled questions well.

Yes. Dr. Gockel covered all of the material we needed to know for exams in great depth.  Yes, she was very clear on what was expected, and presented the material in the most understandable way possible.  My answer to this question is similar to the answer above. She provided good examples (most of them real-world problems, not crazy made-up problems) that were very relevant, and usually touched on many aspects of a particular subject.

748,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 11,"No significant issues are present.  Dr. Gockel is an extremely kind and cool instructor. She is very easy to understand, and doesnt pull things from ""out of the air."" She does things by the book very well, in which i am referencing the textbook. She answered every question as best as she could, and obviously knows her subject well.  She walked us through many examples to make sure we knew how to do the problems, she answered any questions we had, and gave us pop quizzes to keep us on our toes.  She is good at explaining the problems whenever someone is stuck.  Dr. Gockel is a very nice person, but she really needs to work on not making so many errors in what she writes on the board during lecture.  I understand occasional lapses and arithmetic errors, etc...  But errors in the equations that she wrote on the board were so common that I stopped trusting that what she was writing was correct.  It was lucky that there were other students in the class who were on the ball enough to catch her mistakes, otherwise I would have trusted her and not understood the material.  Also, I learned most of this class from the book.  I basically lost interest in the class after the first exam because the material on the exam was nothing like what we learned in class.  In other words, if it weren't an open book exam and it were say, an open note exam, most people would have probably failed miserably.  That being said, I do realize there is a large amount of information in this class.  Great  Dr. Gockel gave plenty of examples during class that helped show concepts from the book.  Clear explanations, relevant examples, good at answering questions, and very respectful. I think of her as a role model.  the teacher was very knowledgeable about the material made sure the student came into the the course understanding the importance of the material like how to look up values from tables to solve problems.  Need to slow when copying your notes to the board.  Explain the step in a little more detail.  Joy has the potential to be one of the best engineering professors in this place.  The Good: - Goes over material straight out of the textbook so it's well organized and easy to look over. - Gives extra credit for those who are struggling - Genuinely wants students to learn The Bad: - She does not understand that there is way too much material in each exam Recommendation: - I HIGHLY recommend you have more than 3 exams a semester. After every chapter, give a smaller version of an exam. This way you can cover everything and test us over it all, but it would still be fair. I promise you will see a huge difference in your exam averages. - Maybe consider allowing students to retake 1 (or 2 if you have more than 3 exams) exams a semester - because sometimes you have bad days. - Give us ALL old exams and worked out problems to look over at the beginning of the semester - I personally like to study material ahead of time for class and exams  Loved your examples in class and how you took the time to step through each part of a problem, I wish more instructors did this.  Was very thorough in examples and offered assistance to the class whenever it was needed.  Dr. Gockel is a wonderful professor who really wants the students to dig into the details and fully understand the concepts  She laid out good examples during class and was available for contact through email. The final project was a topic of choice which allowed us to learn more about our topic of choice.  Examples were well chosen. Writing where the equations, tables, etc were found helped greatly, please continue in future.  Well laid out class with the material covered, good use of examples in class mixed in with the theory, questions were always answered clearly, posed questions to help motivate us to think deeper on the subject. Never had any problems with the class",2017 Fall
749,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"Yes.  Yes, she did. She performed numerous examples in class that were very helpful in the calculation parts of the class. I (and maybe some of the class) went into the first exam not knowing what was going to be on it exactly, resulting in a bad grade for me on it. I think she realized this, and on the second exam, she carefully outlined the kinds of problems and what to expect, and i did exponentially better on it because of it. I was very happy she did this, and also dropping an exam grade takes a load of stress and anxiety off me.  Whenever I had questions about the homework, I went to her office hours, where she answered my questions and explained how to do the problems.  Yes.  Somewhat, but I mostly learned from the book.  She went over a lot of stuff that I didn't find useful for the exams and I also found that my understanding of the material she went over was pretty watered down.  This is not usual for me in classes.  Yes, great in class example  Yes. I met with her on a couple occasions to discuss projects or assignments. She was also more than willing to answer questions.  yes, she taught us from lecture notes to aid in our learning and gave us a project to apply our learning to it.  Yes her step by step instruction for each problem throughout the semester was great. She also had a guest speaker come in and talk about additive manufacturing.  Instructor was very helpful, such as timely responses to emails and help on homework assignments.  very much. Provided good examples in class and challenging homework that really allowed the students to grasp the concepts  She answered questions that were off topic  Yes, examples in class, see above comment.  Yes, examples worked in class really helped with understanding of the material for the homeworks and exams",2017 Fall
750,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"--  The exams were way too long.  Too much material was packed in and most of it was serially ordered so that if you couldn't get an answer to something, you would have trouble moving on.  This made it incredibly difficult when you were stuck on some small detail.  I have seen a lot of exams where the teacher will give you a value to use in the next portion, so that they don't have to carry through errors, i.e. part 'a' of a questions wants to know the torque on something, then in part 'b' they say, using 10 Nm for the value of torque, calculate... blah blah blah.  And 10 Nm wasn't the answer, it was just a generic answer to make sure people could effectively skip a part and not have the whole problem reliant on part 'a.'  I would recommend doing something like that, especially since that makes it easier for you than having to carry through too many errors to give partial credit.  I wish she would make her tests shorter. Her tests are not hard, but there is consistently too much material. It's stressful to be taking a test and see ten minutes left with half the test incomplete. That makes it hard to focus clearly when you're so worried about time.",2017 Fall
751,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 14,"Exam length was consistently an issue. The Exams required longer than the allotted period for many students to complete.  Thank you Dr. Gockel for being my instructor and always being respectful to me and the rest of the class. With you being one of the few professors that teaches your subject, its always a coin flip whether you get a good professor or not. You have consistently (i took you for Mechanical Design 1 too) been nice and respectful and knowledgeable on your subject.  Overall my consensus is that she was very nice but I feel like I learned very little in this class, other than from the book and maybe some general concepts.  Great professor. Exams are pretty long  Thanks for the good semester.  Great class. very interesting to learn. Dr. Gockel did a great job, however sometimes exams can be too long. Overall, very pleased with this class and what I learned  I felt prepared for this class b/c I took Dr. G for MD1  I guess my only real complaint with the class was it seemed the exams were late in terms of the materials on them. I have gotten used to the format where material on the exam is taught right up until the class period before the exam is given. Introducing material that will be on the following exam makes it a bit confusing.

767,ME 7500,Amir Farajian,Question 8,"no  No  no  We need more professors like him.  At the last, Dr. Farajian is very very very good professor.  He is an energetic, dynamic person, seems to enjoy teaching, conveys a love of the field, has an aura of self-confidence, has a thorough command of the field, gives the student a sense of the field, its past, present, and future directions, the origins of ideas and concepts,  presents facts and concepts from related fields,  discusses viewpoints other than his/her own. He is extremely Student Friendly.  No. I am overwhelmed.  Good  The overall lectures were awesome and would like to take another subject under him if got a chance.

768,ME 1040,Sara Mirmasoudi,Question 1,"Good teacher and person.  Good  She was very effective. I feel that she was very thorough and organized in the way she approached and explained the material.  Very good instructor  Very effective. She seemed rude during the first lecture but I soon realized she wasn't being rude, she was just trying to teach effectively. I feel as though I learned a lot from this class and it will help me in the future. She is the best teacher I have ever had.  very knowledgeable, fast paced.  She's alright.  She taught me the basics of how to use solidworks.  She was pretty good at giving the instructions for solidworks.  She is very effective in her teaching style.  Very good  Mostly effective. At first she seemed to fly through the in class tutorials to fast but as the semester went on she had better pacing. So over all I felt like she did her job effectively.  Good instructor, demonstrates the material well, gives us real world material from her experience in industry, automotive, etc.  Decently effective  She was very effective but could sometimes go a little quick in class and be a bit hard to follow. Overall, I enjoyed her as a professor.  She was fairly effective at teaching.  She was an ok instructor. There was lots of things due in one week and it was really hard, because we didn't have the time too. The course got decreased 1 credit hour less, so now it was 3 total credit hour. We were doing the same amount of work for the 4 credit hour class and we didn't get any lab time as well.  Instructor was given half the normal time to teach just as much material and did it flawlessly.  The instructor was extremely effective at engaging students, presenting course material, and ensuring that the learning objectives of the course were well met.  she is a very good instructor. this class is my favorite class. when we have some problem can not understand, she stop immediately to help us to solve the problem.  She was very thorough with explained all the different tools that needed to be learned  fairly effective, fair on grading, goes a little fast in lectures, due to being pushed into the position organization and some of the Design tasks didnt seem complete and we didnt use our books as often as we were told.  great teacher but sometimes moves too fast.  Very effective, 9/10.  She was very effective in helping each student get tasks done.  Was an amazing class. So much to due in a little period of time  I think this instructor was very good at what she does for this class, because she teaches everything in a clear step by step process and was very approachable.  She taught class the whole period and adjusted time for us to have work time to catch up  Design concepts and methods were effectively communicated.  Very effective  Effective in the teaching process of the course material.  Overall the instructor did a very good job keeping me invested in the course while still providing an adequate challenge.  Constantly would move too fast and the entire class would get behind and then she would have to go back and get everyone caught up. The class would have moved much smoother if she slowed down initially.",2017 Spring

Yes the instructor did routinely start class on time and she did use the full class period.  Yes, the time was used well  Yes  yes, gave lab time some classes.  Yes  She was very punctual.  Yes.  She always started class on time and finished of time as well.  Yes.  Classes began on time, and all class time was used productively.  when she finish the class, she will give us open lab time.  Yes  yes  yes  Every day on time.  Yes  She always started class on time. sometimes she ended class early and gave us lab time so we can work on our design tasks  yes, she almost always started the class on time, and used almost all but the last 20 mins which were still used as open lab time.

She made it a point to make sure we were all keeping up and following along with what she was doing as well as walking around and assisting with any problems we were having.  She would always stop class for brief moments to take questions, make sure everyone was caught up, and she even helped us start difficult design tasks.  yes  Not sure.  Yes, she would make sure that no student got left behind during solidworks demonstrations. She would undo what she did and would redo it to make sure everyone was caught up.  She would work with TA's to help out with the errors we encountered  Yes the instructor did demonstrate interest in my learning.  Was very willing to answer questions and assist during class  She frequently checked to make sure we understood methods and processes.  She asked how we were doing with the material, tried to make sure that everyone was caught up and understanding the material.  She would answer any questions I had and allow me to stay after class to finish work.  Yes, she had interesting design tasks and projects.  She would show how to create a part on the projector so everybody will be able to see and then we will just create it  Would give open lab time periodically for students to receive help on anything we were doing at that time.  The instructor showed great interest in students' success, providing feedback and asking questions that engaged students in the topic.  every design task is very interesting, and that let me interested in her classes.  Yes when needed if i asked for help i would be added in all problems I ran into  would help out if i had questions before class  went through examples in class  Brought real world examples make sense.  By seeing my task being done and focusing one my work as a whole.  I loved creating parts on 3d modeling and she always taught us a lot of different ways to make the part  she allowed open lab times at the end of class to allow students to begin working on homework and to assist them if need it be.  She taught me a lot of stuff that Solidworks can do and also taught how it could be applied in real life engineering  She would make time to take questions and answer them before the class.  yes  The teacher was informative and enthusiastic about the information being presented.  The instructor provided the class with real world representations of engineering work, and even incorporated real world parts for the class to build within homework and class assignments. This in turn aided in my overall interest in the subject matter.  She didn't, she had no office hours and relied completely on the TAs for any questions or help.",2017 Spring

I never tried to contact her out of class because I had no need to but she was always open to questions in the classroom.  well, sometimes the instructions on what was due for design task, in the design task was confusing.  Very well.  She was easy to talk to in class and was reachable through email outside of class.  She communicated well in the classroom in relaying information.  The instructor was very effective in communication both in and out of the classroom.  Very well.  Communicated on pilot, through email, and the TA's were available for office hours  Very well. She kept us up to date with regular emails  communicated well both in and out.  very effectivley  She communicated pretty well in class however emailing her was not always a good option as it would take a while to get a reply. Yet, her TA's could always email back pretty quickly.  She was responsive to her email. She was a little unclear of what she expected at times.  The instructor and the TA's took over until the respond back to the emails.It takes them about a week or so for them respond back, which the task was already deu.  Always assured that the students had all the necessary tools to complete the work required.  All emails and information given in lecture were extremely clear and effective(e.g, instructions for using a new feature or creation of a part were clear and easily followed). However, the Design Task instructions, posted as homework on the class pilot webpage, were at times vague, confusing, missing important information, and directly contradictory (e.g, ""submit these files"" and ""submit only that file"").  yes  In class she explains different techniques and tools very effectively and answers all questions that are asked  regular emails about updates and reminders  very well. emailed when needed  Could have been better, she is pretty quick, but the goes back and reviews.  She communicated very well inside class, but outside of class it took a while for her to email me back.

She answered my questions in and out of the class  She was approachable and understanding.  effectively  Communication both in and out of the classroom was effective.

775,ME 1040,Sara Mirmasoudi,Question 8,"What was expected on each assignment was not very clear and ended up missing points for it. Could be more organized.  One of the best instructors I've had on campus so far. Too bad she's not a professor so that she can teach more courses.  Some of the instructions on things were very vague, I believe if things like ""do not submit this"" or an list of everything needed was provided, the class would have went even smoother. That is my only complaint because I feel I was still able to learn all of the material that I was suppose to.  Nope.  She made sure that everyone was learning in the class and understood what she was teaching. She never let a student fall behind.  No.  No I do not have any additional comments to give.  I think the class needed more TAs since she frequently had to stop lecturing because she had to help out with people who got behind.  no  I really enjoyed this class and the professor this semester. Most of the issues I explained are actually not too big of a deal in this class and I was being a bit nit picky since there wasn't too much I would say to improve.  Sara was a good teacher for this engineering course.  The class was easy, but we were always crunched on time. This class is to big to be only three credit hour class.  Instructor Mirmasoudi has an extreme understanding of Solidworks and was always able to assist or fix problems that students came across.  she is very good teacher on classes. same as her I am also using second language life in the US. she English is very good and I can totally understand her. I hope she can keep going she style.  No  No  I think she was a very nice teacher and I wish I could be able to T.A. for her.  Her explanation was good but fast and I could not keep up. I know it is because the class got shorter than before and I think the class time should be longer. Some people already had experience using solidworks so it is understandable that class is boring and waste of time but someone like me who never had this kind of class could struggle. I think the class time should be longer but with no attendance required so people who don't get solidworks can learn a lot and people who already know solidworks don't have to waste time.  No.  focus more on clarifying the instructions on the instruction worksheet on the design tasks.",2017 Spring
776,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 1,"Dr. Jackson is very good with the subject covered in this course. However, I struggled greatly with what he taught. Whatever I got from this course was mostly gained by my studies outside of the classroom.  Poor  Digresses constantly. Does not elaborate very well.  not very effective  Class was not effective  He flat out does not teach. He will ramble for most of the class and expect you to somehow know what to do for homework and exams.  horrible had to learn most of the material on my own examples in class were nothing like the homework based on difficulty and how they were worded  He is a fairly average professor from a teaching standpoint. He is an engaging person in a small group conversation.  Dr. Jackson is an okay lecturer.  He is a nice individual who likes to see his students succeed and is willing to help. But unfortunately the course itself was not very well taught and he isn't very easy to understand and follow.  Good  ok  he is nice and funny, and he care alot about the students  Good  Good material  Not very. Extremely unorganized and dysfunctional class. Extremely boring with no really engaging topics or assignments. Often in class students, myself included, were clueless as to what was going on or being covered in lecture. The book was terrible, full of equations with no clear explanation as to where they came from or how they are used. The beginning of class often never provided an outline to what would be covered during lecture, so the first 15-20 minutes were spent trying to find where in the notes he was going. The notes he posted online from lecture were not posted till after class and were usually just like the book, full of equations with no real explanation on how to use them. Toward the end of the semester the frustration among the students was pretty clear. Students, myself included, stopped showing up to class because they felt that it was a waste of time to sit in class listening for an hour and a half and constantly be confused or lost as to what was going on. When asked questions, his answers were usually very vague and confusing and often ended with a rant talking about ""well in real life you get real data, which never works out ideally so you can't use this data, or this equation...etc"". Cant wait to be done with this class.  a  not bad  Not very effective.  While Dr. Jackson is very nice and polite, he does not not seem very helpful. There was a minimum number of functional examples of coursework to prepare for exams. Functional examples would pertain to examples that show step by step how to work problems; most examples were questions with answers, and no explanation of how the answer was derived.  0  Dr. Jackson is very intelligent but tends to be a bit monotone. This sometimes distracts some of the students as it is already a semi-uninteresting course. In my personal opinion I think Dr. Jackson would make a great senior design instructor. He has real world experience and asks the tough questions.  Very effective instructor. Extremely knowledgeable.  good  Seemed to be prepared to have class. Just too much material to learn in one class.  great, very knowledgeable.  Not as effective as I would have hoped. Took a couple of lectures for his microphone to be repaired (?). Though the content of his lectures were somewhat helpful, the Excel programs as worked problems were difficult to analyze. It was also hard to get anything out of the solved solution manual questions he used as examples periodically. His handwritten solutions were much more thorough, but difficult to read.  there was none  Got stuff done on schedule and had time to help us with problems we were all having troubles with  Nice guy, obviously intelligent but I had a very hard time learning from him.  Part of the problem was the class setup: I have not had a single scale-up style class that I thought didn't waste a significant amount of time, and this one was no exception.  further, the class size was to large for such a complicated subject, and the TA's appeared to mostly exist to grade homework.  Finally, his use of in-class tech was a constant distraction, from the mic which kept going out mid class to versions of software that wouldn't do what wanted.  I think that the most effective teaching tool he used was solving problems step by step on the overhead projectors (even though his handwriting is atrocious.)   Of all the courses I have taken that had a prerequisite, this is THE ONE that should have had statistics as a prereq!  Overall fairly effective.  Not very well",2017 Spring

He was average when communicating. on a side note the microphone problem in the class room needs to be permanently resolved if you expect to continue having such large class sizes in a spread out room.  Well.  pretty effective  very good  he is nice  available for any question  Occasionally sent out emails with assigned homework problems or clarification over something from the lecture  on that he is really good  well, via email and pilot for course material and lecture updates  He communicates averagely. He struggles to keep the class interested. Very monotone.  Fine.  Yes he was always available for consultation.  Very effectively  yes  His mic would cut out/ lose battery a lot during classes. He also had a tough time hearing people.  Went very fast through powerpoints and example problems so it was hard to take notes and pay attention. The problem with using excel is that we see the final answer but have no idea what the equation used to find that answer, also he would go fast though them so they ended up being useless because I couldn't follow along with him going so fast.  not well. i was always lost  through email out of class and in class just announced  not well-  I sometimes think he had an assumption of content on my part that was definitely above my current level.  He communicated effectively.  Not very well",2017 Spring
781,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 6,"No, we skipped around in the book often which lead to a lot of confusion. The book that was used for the course was also poorly written.

In fact, he was worse, which was something that I did not think was possible. He will blow through the lab and expect you to be able to miraculously keep up.  Dr. Jackson was over worked with the size of his class, which affected his ability to help students. The ta, Zach, was not only unhelpful but condescending and rude. He provided no benefit to the labs.  Often times the labs were disorganized and students were left confused. There were not enough TA's in the class either so when groups had questions, they would often have to wait 10-20 minutes to receive an answer. Overall, this lab experience was frustrating.

Provided positive feedback.  Nothing,2017 Spring
788,ME 3600L,Allen Jackson,Question 5,Good  did not communicate with him  ok  He flat out didn't.  Dr. Jackson would email if any changes or information needed to be addressed.  He did a good job.  Well. He sent emails out of class to reiterate what he said in class.  the labs were poorly organized and took much longer than the allocated time  very good  he tried to make all of us understanding the materials  Decently  some as the lecture class  Not too great  All answers are the same as the lecture.  Very  he was free at many times outside of class  I never contacted him.  said what the labs were in class before the day of lab and had a schedule with each weeks lab  meh  He communicated effectively.  Not very well,2017 Spring
789,ME 3600L,Allen Jackson,Question 6,"The labs were very poorly organized. Often times, we would be able to start the labs until there was only about 45 min left of the lab time due to the instructor trying to cover how to do the lab. There were insufficient lab assistants so questions wouldn't get answered in a timely manner during the lab. Several labs were so disorganized that it took most of the class period to figure out how to properly due the lab to get the desired data.  Yes  not at all  yes  Oh absolutely not. This has been, by far, the most haphazard, poorly put together class I have been a part of.  There were times when the lecture was hard to follow. This would be after a difficult lab, when we were about to start new material.  Not particularly.  No. The labs were often disorganized and the time was not used well. There were not enough TAs for the number of students. So if we got stuck, we were often waiting for over 15 minutes waiting for a TA to get to us.  not really  no labs were confusing and most people stayed and hour after lab every week to finish gathering data  yes  Absolutely not. Disorganization and dysfunction should be the class title.  some how yes but not good enough  No  All answers are the same as the lecture.  Yes  Sort of he could have organized them better and released information at an earlier time period.  No, some labs were extremely jumbled and confusing to the point that a lot of the content was lost. For example, the last lab, which was a formal report lab, was so hard and confusing that 90% of the class had to stay way late after class to finish. Even then, my group missed the entire procedure and point of the lab. I ended up just being a race to try to get as many points as possible.  labs very very confusing, many times we would wait 30 minutes to ask a simple question, there needs to be more TAs that can help. Also many times the lab TA would tell us the wrong information and then would have to get Dr. Jackson to fix what the TA messed up.  not really  not always because its a big class and hard to get everyone on board with the same lab setup  meh  Yes they were well organized.  Not very well",2017 Spring

791,ME 3600L,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"No  labs need revamped and students need taught how to use the software he wants us to use. Every lab used the same software but after the first lab we were expected to know how to program in this software based off of the directions given to us (which are poorly given)  no  He sucks. Fire him. He's only causing more budget problems for Wright State by being kept.  No.  While Dr. Jackson tried his best to make the labs go smoothly, they never did. Only having one TA for a lab with over 50 people was a bad decision. The head TA, Zach was not helpful and often times got frustrated because he could not figure out what was not working. On top of not having an answer he graded our work very harshly. I felt this was unreasonable as neither him not Dr. Jackson had an answer for our labs when we were stuck.  the labs in my opinion need to be revised  no  This class was a complete waste of time because I feel that I didn't effectively learn everything that was meant to be taught in this lab along with the class. This feeling is mutual between many students in this lab and class. A fresh new start with a new professor may be the best option  no  No  All answers are the same as the lecture.  needs to release information on solutions after assignments have been completed not wait for exam and give us the solution.  labs were very confusing and hard to figure out the end result. the lab manual was  many times hard to understand to determine what graphs needed to be plotted for the final report. Would have also been nice to remind us to take screen shots of lab results since the Texas instrument was required for the results to review the lab results.  No additional comments.  No",2017 Spring

The professor aims to let the students understand everything in this lab. I have learned a lot from this course.  great  Instructor did excellent job explaining expectations to students and made sure all students understood given lab and how to achieve accurate results in a safe environment.  He effectively introduced labs, answered questions on material, and gave other guidance when necessary.  Very effective. Knowledgeable and kind.  Yes  so effective  Dr. Jackson knows the material well however often times has a hard time translating it into words for other to understand. Often times if asked a question regarding a required calculation or about the lab he wouldn't know 100%. I appreciate his willingness to sit down with our group and let us answer questions and work through problems.

Yes, expectations in course syllabus were clearly defined and followed.  Yes  Yes, could have explained grading report expectations in more detail. Not sure it was him, more his TA.

Yes, instructor used all resources accordingly  Yes  Yes, this class didn't meet very often (by design).  Yes  Always started on time but the nature of the class never kept us the full time.

799,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"post grades on pilot and not only have 10% of the grade up at the end of the semester can get better on lab reports if get no feed back before the next lab is due  No.  I really liked the format where we talked to you about our lab reports in your office. I feel like we got a lot more out of that than just seeing a grade on pilot. It is a good way to pass along information in my opinion.  no  I enjoy his thorough work with students, and willingness to address any question or concern about the class. He would also talk about the professional world and real applications of the subject material.  No  Dr. Jackson is a very intelligent individual who knows a lot about materials. With that being said he often expects all students in this class to have a high understanding of material science when most do not. This causes for contusion and not correct results.",2017 Spring

808,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 1,"He is okay.  Well being that this was his first time teaching Matlab it is understandable the he started poorly. He improved lots throughout the semester and if the whole class was taught like it was towards the end, I feel I would have learned a lot more. I feel that it is unfair of how his ineffectiveness at the beginning  of the semester hurt so many grades. Dr. B did teach very well once we started GUI's though and if he keeps that up he will be very effective as an instructor for this course.  pretty effective  He did a good job of teaching the class. He made it enjoyable even though I am not very good with computers.  10/10 I loved this class. craig did a great job teaching it  Professor Baudendistel is a great instructor and his effectiveness was overall presented well.  For teaching the class for the first time, I'd say Craig was an effective instructor. I'm certainly nowhere near the best programmer in the class, but I can say that I have learned a fair amount of programming from this class  Dr.B was a effective professor but in the beginning of the course he was very fast in his teachings.  He needed to slow down the class cause he thought we know Matlab.  Dr. B was very effective as an instructor.  He was able to easily convey information that I could understand and follow.  Dr. B is a very effective instructor. There were a couple times where his lecture slides did not have the correct information on them.  very effective  He was decent, however, he often times did not explain fully how to solve a certain type of problem. He would simply show you a question on the board, have you try to solve it, then give you the answer with little or no explanation and then go on to the next question.  Dr. Baudendistel was an enthusiastic and effective instructor, the class was fast paced and hard to follow at times, but he was willing to work with anyone unable to keep up.  Instructor was very effective. Made a difficult class rather enjoyable  Effective. I would have preferred that he worked through more code in class before he gave us things to work on. I felt like I had no idea what was going on a lot of the time. I really enjoyed how the TAs ran the review sessions because they really worked through problems in a way that was easy to understand. I think Dr. B was far too ambitious on the amount of material that he wanted to cover. I think it is somewhat unreasonable to expect students to do homework during finals week, especially when a large project is due.  he did a good job teaching the class  The instructor was extremely effective at engaging the class and conveying lecture information.  The instructor was very good at his teaching except for a few things.  The initial portion of the class was expected just slightly higher amount of knowledge from egr 1010.  Egr 1010 did have the matlab content but it was not the main aspect of the class and didn't affect the grade hardly at all.  Resulting from this, most students didn't take matlab as a priority hence not preparing them for ME 1020.  Not always prepped for exams but besides these two points instructor did well conveying material and helping students.  Bit of a rocky start, but the pacing got much better.  Class seemed to be rushed a bit through out the semester, more and different examples would be helpful, especially for reference for the homework.  Pace towards the end of the semester was much better.  Maybe try and integrate the GUI's and project a little earlier.  ODE section felt very rushed.  Overall, nice first semester at 1020.  It will only get better.  Very good even though it was his first time teaching the course  He is a very good instructor. I would recommend him to anyone.  For having no prior teaching experience with Matlab, Dr. B did an excellent job. He was well-organized and understood the material.  he really tried his hardest so we could under stand the tough material  One of the best instructors I've ever had. When nearly the entire class failed his first exam, he offered a make-up and changed his tactics. Most other instructors I know would be too self-centered to admit that their teaching or evaluation methods were flawed.  He was very helpful and I learned a lot. The start of the class was rough due to it being his first time but he worked with the class to know how best to teach the class.  Great  Dr. B is a very effective professor.  He has an amazing ability to adapt to any problem and give assistance.  4/5 stars. Very nice guy, hes a good professor, but he would tend to make exams longer and harder than they need to be. He would set us up for failure many times in class, which I do not always agree with.  He was a great instructor for this course and was very informative. You can tell that he loved what he taught.  poor  Craig knows his stuff very well  and is always enthusiastic. Very fun to learn from.  The beginning was rough since I had no idea how to code in matlab and no experience with syntax but around halfway through I was able to understand the lessons and learn a lot. It helped a lot when he started the lesson by dragging us through either an example code or the first code in a series of codes.",2017 Spring
809,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 2,"Yes  I have no opinion on this because once I feel I was taught better my grades reflected it, but at the beginning of the semester I learned nothing, was plain confused the whole time, and spent countless hours trying to figure it out.  yes  Yes he did!  yes  He based the work based on the course syllabus. However there were times where the work was large and the time was not available.  Yes  Dr.B did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus.  NO! he kept pushing us even though we didn't understand the section. HE never slowed down t let us learn the material.  Yes.  The grades received for different assignments were based on the expectations in the syllabus.  yes  Yes, he evaluated fairly and how I expected.  Dr. Baudendistel would evaluate work based off of the syllabus and would deviate from it only when he had already cleared it with the class.  yes  Yes  yes  All coursework was graded clearly, in accordance with the syllabus.  Yes  Yes, very adaptable to student's needs as well.  Yes  Yes he did.  yes  yes he did  Yes.  Yes. and how hard we worked  Yes  the syllabus was accurate throughout the year  Yes, he did.  Yes, the syllabus made it very clear what the expectations for this class were and the grade breakdown.  no  Yes.  Yes, the syllabus detailed how the work would be graded and that outline was followed throughout the semester.",2017 Spring
810,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 3,"Yes  Yes  yes  Yes he did!  yes  Yes  Yes, honestly I think this should have been an 80 minute class rather than 55 minutes because we used every bit of class we time we had, and could've used more  Dr.B started class on time and used the full class period.  Yes  Yes.  He usually started class on time. Sometimes he got carried away and did not realize that the class time was over and would continue teaching. Someone would have to notify him that the class time was over.  yes  Class was always started on time.  The class always started on time and would run the entire time block.  yes  Yes  always  The instructor was timely and punctial;classes regularly began and finished on time  yes  yes.  Yes  Class always started on time and always went the full length.  yes  he used the full class time to the best of his capabilities, and even spent extra time if we needed it.  Yes. I recommend scheduling this class for longer periods in the future. 55 minutes was too short, I would be okay with 80 minute periods 3 days per week.  Yes  Yes  class was always started on time  Yes, sometimes we would accidentally go over time, since it is only a 55 minute class.  Yes, he started class on time everyday, and used the entire class time period.  the class time was spent inefficient but he was on time and was teaching whole period  Yes  Yes. Though I would have liked more time to look over the material before class. We only have an hour so if we could look over material before hand it might help a bit.",2017 Spring
811,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 4,"He is okay.  He demonstrated this by adapting the class to how it should have actually been from the start.  interesting projects and demonstrations  He was always open for questions and had extensive office hours  he offered office hours, gladly answered any questions asked in class and reviewed anything the students had trouble understanding  Yes, he always asked for questions from the students and had activities during class.  Craig pushed us to apply prior knowledge to each task we learned throughout the semester, and tried to give examples of how you could apply these skills to the outside world  Dr.B showed a lot of interest in my learning.  He didn't!  Dr. B would occasionally work with the other TA's to help out the students with the errors in their code.  He made sure to teach us what companies would like to see people to have. Also he gave us real world applications for the different topics.  yes  He made plenty of office hours which I found to be of great help.  Dr. Baudendistel wanted to make sure that all the students in the class were able to understand the topics explained in class.  Instructor was readily available for questions and gave lots of help when asked  Dr B was extremely enthusiastic and I really appreciated his interest in the field and he always made sure to relate what we were learning to the field  he answered all questions we had and was available in office hours for any further explanation  The instructor was extremely engaged in students' learning, providing feedback, asking questions that prompted critical thinking, and was responsive to the pace of the class.  yes  Showing and using practical examples, almost all applied examples.  Yes  He was very passionate about what he was teaching us. He gave lots of help when needed.  Dr. B always addressed any questions sincerely and answered them in a comprehensible manner.  he tried the best he could to help each and every student given the size of the entire class  Hard to explain. Dr. B. never insulted your intelligence. If you had an issue, he would explain it until you understood it, within the time constraints of the class period.  He is helpful and answer emails to point us in the right direction  He was always excited to teach and willing to help if anyone had trouble understanding.  real world examples were always provided to prove the importance of the class  He would show us cool things you can do with Matlab, and will show you how to do something in Matlab while being polite.  He was always very energetic during class making even the most boring material interesting, and he was almost always available after class to help on a problem with the programing.  did not interest me  He made everything as interesting as it could be. He made coding less of a chore  seeing how we can create programs to represent real world problems helped a lot.",2017 Spring
812,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 5,"Effectively  He communicated amazingly. There were times when I would email him at 11:30pm and he would respond at 11:31 pm.  very effectively  Very well.  very well  He communicated well.  Craig is very good about communicating what we need to know inside and outside of class  Dr.B effectively communicated in and out of the classroom allowing me to email him whenever I had a problem with the material.  OK  He communicated very well in the classroom as well as outside the classroom during office hours.  He told us when everything was due and told us when he fixed different homework questions. He was not always 100% clear about when assignments were due. Homework was not due on a normal schedule.  yes  He communicated well.  Dr. Baudendistel tried his best to understand the material for the first time well enough to explain it to the class, but do to him learning the material along with the class, some of the topics seemed unreasonably difficult or cumbersome at times.  Communicated very effectively.

He was very helpful and would answer questions and emails.  Very Well  homework was frequently put up late and grading was slow at best  He did very well with communication. He uses Pilot frequently unlike a lot of professors. Polite in the classroom, and used a loud voice so people could hear.  Almost everything that he needed the class to know they did know, because e got the information out to us as soon as possible.  he sent me email couple times and he answered question when I asked both inside and outside of the class room.

No!  Yes. The notes followed a similar format during the week. This was a welcome as it was easy to understand the main points and details that mattered.  Lectures were organized well.  well organized with there were some reference sheets on pilot  They were well organized however, they could use more explanation before diving into solving a problem.  The content was well organized, but was not always as thoroughly explained as some would like do to time restraints of the fifty minute time block.  yes  Very well  they were well organized. The exam schedule and content was sort of made up as the class went on, but it was laways well-organized when presented.  For the most part, the lectures were well organized. Several sections seemed rushed, with too little exposition into the ""why"" or ""how"" of a method, particularly the sections upon numerical methods. Some important examples from class were absent from the posted notes( particularly the GUI section), which caused some confusion preparing for exams.

815,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 8,"He is okay.  Any comments I said were not meant to be hurtful. You taught the class great at the end and I completely understand it being your first time teaching it. I just wish I could have done better in the beginning of the class so I didn't hurt my GPA.  class was very interesting and I learned a lot. However the work load towards the end of the semester was pretty rough on top of a full engineering schedule. The project was hard to do while still keeping up on exams and homework. One or the other may have been more effective.  He was one of the best professors I had this semester  As one who isn't super tech savvy and doesn't know a whole lot about computers and programming and all things computer science, this class was a bit more challenging for me than others, but I feel with the help provided I was able to be successful enough and I have learned a thing or two about coding. I wish the review sessions had been at times when I was available, but posting the review sheets and solutions on Pilot did help. Craig is a very kind and understanding guy, so I felt less intimidated to ask questions which was nice. The written portion for the exams were a nice way to earn points for those who struggle a bit with the actual computer portion. Being able to get help from others at the table was helpful. Overall, fun semester. P.S. Please build an Iron Man suit, you look like Tony Stark and I'm sure you're more than capable of figuring out how to build one  Dr.B for being his first time teaching this course, he was a good professor.  He was not a very good teacher!  No.  He put extra time and effort in to making sure he knew the information that he was teaching. The final project was a lot of work and it was hard to focus on working on that and other homework and the work for other classes.  none  Exams are not usually too hard but I always felt that the exams were a bit too long for the class period. I often felt myself rushing and making simple mistakes just to finish on time. I would even leave mistakes knowing they were there just because I did not have enough time to fix them on occasion.  Dr. Baudendistel did a good job instructing this class for the first time, but it needs work and a little more planning before teaching another.  no  no  I will always sign up for his classes, awesome teacher.  Instructor is doing well and did very well for first year teaching.  Experience throughout his teaching career will definitely make him even better.  Other recommendation is to maybe start python just slightly earlier so their is more time for practice.  Wish I could take him again next semester. Great prof, great guy. Very intelligent  great teacher  He has a good base on how the class needs to be taught and tests structured. Now its only experience is needed.  He was a very engaging instructor and I was very happy to be able to take any class that he would teach. He's also very knowledgeable and down to earth allowing him to be very approachable.  I believe the class could use a recitation.  Might need to hold back on some of that homework. I can understand a few hours of homework can help a lot but I spent a lot of time on it plus having the project and homework at the same time makes progress for both very slow.",2017 Spring
816,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 1,"Honestly, not as effective as I would have hoped. I felt like a lot of stuff was glossed over and I had to go hunting through the text to make sense of what happened during lecture. Like I was getting just pieces of the puzzle, but I didn't really know what the puzzle was supposed to look like in the first place.  He was important to my learning of the topics and material of the course.  The course could have been better if the lecture is well prepare. I feel like the subjects is not organize and some time I got confuse between chapters.  Overall Dr. Mian is only moderately effective. He is very disorganized and inconsistent in the quality and relevance of the material. He has poor attention to detail and is not a stellar communicator.  I have taken Dr. Mian twice and I have been let down both times. He simply does not explain things in an organized or clear manner. Attempting to take notes in class is difficult and you cannot piece together the information later when reviewing notes because it is so scattered.  This i the third class Ive had Dr. Mian for. That being said, I knew what to expect coming in to the semester and got exactly what I expected. I feel he genuinely cares about his students and wants to be a good professor, but when it comes down to it he can't effectively teach. The lectures are all over the place and we seldom go over 2 problems in class even when the whole class period is set to be ""example time"". The heavy emphasis on Simulink is ridiculous when he (a professor who already isnt an effecient instructor) gives us a half-effort lecture on how to use Simulink's basic functions, then expects us to do complex homework problems. Then comes the next big problem, the TA homework graders. I have done everything correct on homework assignments and still gotten 80% of the points because of arbitrary mark-offs in the middle of my work. Even when it matches his homework solutions after the fact.  not great  Class time was not well spent. Many times the objective of the lecture was unclear, and Dr. Mian was often stumbling upon his thoughts. It never felt like he had organized note but rather was improvising some lecture just to spend the entire class time.  Fairly effective. Often seemed quite unprepared for teaching the class. Examples were not consistently clear, and occasionally used some confusing wording and explanations.  Very poor  Dr. Mian is a very solid professor. He takes the time to do quite a few examples to go along with his lectures and frequently asks for questions to make sure the class understands the material being presented.  I learned from this instructor, but it was difficult to keep myself engaged, because I felt like I didn't know what all to write in my notes. the pattern of the class was eccentric, and he gave us information in a lot of different ways, like the whiteboard or the tablet. It was hard to follow his thought process.  The professor did not use class time wisely and, for much of the material, I had to work with others in the class to try and learn the material ourselves.  Not the most clear and effective, but it could be worse.  make this form stop popping up every time i log into pilot  I believe that Dr. Mian did a pretty good job at effectively teaching me the material. I took him twice this semester and am glad that I did.  Not to bad  Alright. Lecture was normally productive. Sometimes though when jumping back to a previous chapter for no apparent reason did it became confusing since that chapter was done and we were will into the next one.  Good  Very good teacher.  Hard to understand  Overall the concepts came across. He tended to skim matrial a bit. Going a little to fast over some subjects. He would pause and give us time to think, but when he was going over things already written out on the projector, that was when he would go a biy fast.  Dr. Mian is easy to understand and very good at explaining the material in class. He is very attentive to questions and thoroughly responds to them to aid the student in understanding.",2017 Spring
817,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 2,"Yes  Yes, the instructor evaluate me on the expectations that were listed in the syllabus  yes  For exams, yes, but quiz grading is poor because even simple problems with the correct answer and adequate work shown can receive half credit.  Our work was evaluated as stated in the syllabus.  not really  Mostly, sometimes he would do a poor job explaining a concept. I would solve it on the homework the way we had learned in class and no matter how much effort I had put forth, my home work grades/quiz grades would suffer. I had only solved certain things the way he had explained them.  Yes.  The quiz and homework grades were a complete crap shoot. you either get a 70 or a 10.  You never knew  Yes. The syllabus outlined the class very closely and there was nothing that deviated from material that was stated in the document.  Yes  The instructor graded the exams the way that was described in the syllabus. The homework and the quizzes were graded so horribly, I could have taken half of my quizzes back to him to get re-graded because they were graded so badly. There was a quiz that said, ""What do the terms 'System' and 'Dynamics' mean to you?"" and I got a 30% on the quiz even though the answer should be completely subjective based on the problem statement. Many other quizzes were graded similarly to this.  Yes  I believe that he did for the most part.  Yes  Yes  He did indeed.  Yes  I'm pretty sure.  Yes, work evaluation was based on the syllabus.",2017 Spring

Yes.  yes  He started class on time but usually about 5 minutes into the lecture, he either forgot his notes or his flash drive. We even started class using a students notes because he did not have his.  Class would generally begin and end on time, though he would mix in breaks varying between seconds to minutes that often did not help much.  yes  Yes. Professor Mian was always on time and used the class time effectively.  There were some instances where he was a little disorganized and had to run back to his office in order to retrieve the notes he needed.  Yes  Yes  Yes he did. It was very rare to get out early.  Yes  Yes  He was very routine.  yes he went over a lot of the time  Yes, he was punctual.  Class was started on time and used the full class period.",2017 Spring
819,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 4,"He really wanted us to interact with him, but I never understood the current lecture enough to formulate a question other than ""What the heck is going on right now?"".  He would repeatedly stop and ask if we understood.  If we didn't he would explain the concept again.  It is clear that Dr. Mian loves what he does, which is nice. He also explains how our work can be applied to real life systems.  he cares but is not a good professor  I was very interested to learn about System Dynamics; however, Dr. Mian made it very difficult to pay attention in class and learn  Despite some unclear examples/explanations, you could tell he was trying to explain everything in a way we all understood.  He tried to but he is just a better researcher than a professor  Professor Mian encouraged us to talk to him if we had issues with the material, frequently asked for questions, and even gave us some time to talk among ourselves to clear things up with the material being presented.  He continually attempted to ask questions to the class to get them engaged in what he was talking about.  Yes  He always tries to help as much as he can. He sometimes struggles to communicate clearly so that is the only issue with his teaching.  Dr. Mian was always looking for people to ask questions. This is something I can really appreciate.  I would say 7 out of 10  Answered questions asked during class, modified problems with different parameters to show how things became affected by it  Yes, he paused to let students absorb information.  He was very interested in us learning and participating in class.  Yes, Dr. Mian was interested in the class's learning and would explain things further if there were topics that were unclear.",2017 Spring

When homework or quizzes were posted, he would notify use vis email.  He communicated well.  his emails were helpful  He tried his best to answer questions  Sufficiently well in both cases.  Not well he was confusing to listen to and his notes were poorly laid out  Very effectively.  He did admit to having broken English, and I feel like he mixed up a few of the words he tried to say, or referenced the incorrect part of a diagram or number in the problem.  Effectively  Struggles to make his teaching clear, but he tries his best. Always available to help.  There were a few times when there was some slight hiccups for the most part though I have no complaints.  Yes  Good, emails were sent out went homework got posted.  very  Pretty effective.

Like why I'm doing the operations that I'm being told lead to the solution.  For the most part they were.  Sometimes he would skip around.  not really  No.  No.  no, not at all  No, class time did not seemed organized at all, often times he would show a very basic (UNSOLVED) example that he had already don't on a pdf file. He would talk it through but never really solve the example, the homework seemed to be more difficult than it needed to be due to the lack of examples.  Yes.  NOT AT ALL  Yes. He had many powerpoints to go along with the lecture and example problems.  Content was organized in an order that made sense, but the lectures felt like they were off topic, or had several topics to talk about. I would suggest having a more concrete idea of what the lecture needs to convey, or stick to a plan more rigidly.  Not even close to organized. He just kind of made stuff up as he went and it was hard to learn what he was trying to express to us.  I'd rate him 7/10 on this question  Yes.  Yes  Usually.

ALSO why didn't my ""advisor"" even know what this was?  No.  Please let someone other that Dr. Mian  (i.e. Dr. Slater) teach this class. The topics are too important for us to have to go through the same grabage we had to deal with in Mechanics of Materials. In that class, we could get away with is with prior knowledge from Statics. That puts a burden on Mech Design 1 to recap what we were supposed to learn in MoM but didnt. I do not want to pay all of that money to get nothing in return from Dr. Mian.  I felt the grading was not on the same scale. Often times a bunch of us would get different quiz scores but when cross checking the quizzes, the points he had taken off did not align with each quiz. It felt he was grading each one on a different scale  No.  Very solid professor.  I think switching back and forth between the screen and the whiteboard disrupt the flow of the class. I would suggest using one of those materials per lecture, but shy away from using both, unless you plan on switching for the rest of the lecture.  No  Enjoyed the class and the teacher.  No  It was annoying when the online quizzes had a 20 minute time limit. I don;t think it did anything but it was annoying, especially when the first couple online quizzes were unlimited time.

He is hard to follow, understand, and pay attention to.  Excellent  Instructor is hard to understand and not very well organized. Lectures did not provide anything beneficial in terms of learning.  He was effective in my learning. I don't feel that this class was very necessary sometimes, as we would not learn new things during class but review things that were leaned in previous courses.  Fine  I didn't need to show up to 1 class for anything this semester. The people who came in to talk were boring and just talked about stuff we've done in other classes. He didn't communicate on due dates so some things snuck up on us. He also didn't make evryone turn in their PowerPoint at the same time so some groups has an extra week and a half to complete their PowerPoint and that's not right. We also had to go the first day so we didn't get to see what the PowerPoint should look like and other groups did. A Dropbox for the PowerPoint should have been put up the morning of the presentations  so that people couldn't make improvements and they all would have had the same due date to complete it.

In each case, his notes are very detailed and easy to understand, he is always more than willing to answer any relevant question, and he very clearly explains how to apply the theory to practical problems. He helped us understand when and where to make certain assumptions and why they were justified, all the while keeping the course material interesting and the classes entertaining. Consistently one of the best professors I've had at this university, and by far one of the best in the department.  Its scott. He is a great instructor  Very effective. All knowing syllabus kept us on track.  Extremely effective.  I usually have trouble paying attention during 80 minute classes. However, Dr. Thomas made lectures exciting by being enthusiastic.  He was a very effective instructor. Very knowledgeable and willing to stop and help anyone.  Scott is a very effective instructor who organizes everything pertaining to his class well before the semester even begins and then follows his plan.  Dr. Thomas is an excellent professor. I feel as if I fully understand the material presented to me.  I felt he was effective. Class was structure well, going over the concepts first and then example problems to help further explain them. No hidden surprises, always tried to be up front and straight forward. I felt I learned some things and it helped going back over some of the fluid dynamics stuff.  Very Effective. Very Fair. Love him  Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor. He is very interested in the subject, and very energetic in his delivery of the content! Made it fun to come to lecture and fun to learn!",2017 Spring
849,ME 3360,Scott Thomas,Question 2,"yes  Yes, the instructor evaluate me on the expectations that were listed in the syllabus.  The instructor takes the syllabus very seriously and follows it word for word.  Yes  Ok the first exam we had 3 chapters to cover. The exam had 4 questions and 2 of them were from chapter 2. The other 2 were from chapter 1 and 3. Chapter 2 was worth 20/30 points. Chapter 1 was worth 4/30. Chapter 3 was worth 6/20. This means that chapter 2 was worth 66 percent of the exam. That is terrible for seeing what people know out of all three chapters. It needs to be weighted better because every chapter is important.  Yes  Yes.  Our work is evaluated exactly like the syllabus says it will be.  yes  yes  Yes. The syllabus was very detailed and organized, and we never broke from it.  He was fair in his grading, I am hesitant to say he is fair yet until I take his final, his exams are a thing of nightmares on occation  Yes  The syllabus was, as promised, never wrong or questioned, and everything in it was well defined. I feel as though the instructor graded fairly and consistently.  Yes. Dr. Thomas always began lectures by reviewing the ALMIGHTY SYLLABUS OF HEAT TRANSFER.  Yes  Yes, he is a very fair grader.  Yes, Dr. Thomas sticks to his syllabus to a T.  Yes  Yes he did  Expectations were very clear in the syllabus.",2017 Spring
850,ME 3360,Scott Thomas,Question 3,"yes  Yes, class was started on time everyday and the class time was well spent.  This instructor starts class at the time exactly and uses the full time because there is so much material to cover.  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes.  Yes.  yes  yes  Always started class exactly on time, and rarely released early, except in cases where we were assigned a problem at the end of class. Those days, we would maybe leave a couple minutes early depending on how quickly we solved the problem.  WIthin seconds  Yes  ""Two o' clock exactly"" every single day.  He always started on time. A couple times he let out a few minutes early, but heat transfer is the kind of topic that requires several minutes to do an example or talk about theory, so there wasn't much that could have been done in that small amount of time anyway.  Every. Single. Time.  Yes, there were a few classes that ended early, but we still remained on schedule.  Yes, class time was very well spent.

851,ME 3360,Scott Thomas,Question 4,"always answered questions when asked  Yes, he taught and explained thing very clearly.  He was always willing to help if a concept was not understood.  He was always more than willing to answer any question in class and he always takes time outside of class to make sure the student understands what is going on.  yes  He answered everyone's questions  He often used great examples and interacted with students consistently.  Dr. Thomas is very passionate about what he does and he always provides us with real world applications. He also provides hints as to what we will get to do if we carry on our education in graduate school.  yes  yes, was not interested in the subject prior to the class. Now this has become a very enjoyable lecture  He was always happy to respond to questions and would give further explanations and outside knowledge even if that example was not inherently in the scope of the course material. Even if it was outside of what we'd be typically learning, it is definitely still useful and enjoyable to learn some outside information, especially when the actual course material was not delayed or simplified as a result. We've had some very interesting discussions in this heat transfer class.  He would take and ask questions, very engaging  Yes  The instructor has boundless enthusiasm for the topic, and is willing to go deeper into the learning process by showing us pictures and figures, as well as answering hypothetical questions if they are conducive to an understanding of the material.  Made sure to ask if we had questions after explaining something.  He would constantly ask about our understanding to ensure we were up to speed.  He was always making sure everyone knew what he was talking about. There were many times, however, that a student would ask really stupid questions that didn't have much with what we were trying to learn and Scott would take time to try and answer it. This would have been better if he just met Scott in his office hour instead of wasting everyone's time.  Dr. Thomas is extremely passionate about the classes he teaches and cares about each of his students. He learns students names and calls them by them every time you ask a question. I told him my name one time and he never forgot it!  Answered questions in class and wouldn't move on until he was sure the question was fully answered and all confusion eliminated from student's minds, no matter how small  Gave a lot of real world examples, showing the applications of heat transfer  Dr. Thomas showed interest in my learning by calling on me and other students by name and making sure to take extra time to clear up any questions on the subject. Examples were easy to understand and were fun to pay attention to.",2017 Spring

855,ME 3360,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"no  No.  Overall the class is taught very well. The only thing that is hard is sometimes things either get going to fast or we get to sidetracked in the class.  no  My one major criticism of how Dr. Thomas formats his courses is with the homework. All of the students appreciate getting the worked out answers to the homework because that allows us to move forward when we are stuck and to help have extra examples from which to learn. I personally think that doing homework without knowing the correct answer only causes people to practice incorrect methodology, as they don't know if they did it correctly or if they need to revise their method, and only perfect practice makes perfect. But because of how long the homework problems became in the end, mixed with how many problems were assigned, many people had to rely on copying the answers quickly because there was not enough time to finish the homework on their own. This is compounded by the fact that we often learned crucial information in the class before the homework was due, meaning we effectively had one and a half days to do most of the homeworks unless we just copied. Also, having to scan in the homework and bring it to class was never helpful to me and it added a significant burden to preparing and finishing my homework.  The one thing I don't like about the lectures is that a talkative student can disrupt the entire class period. I like that Dr. Thomas encourages questions, but sometimes we spend way too much time on questions from individuals that should be handled in either office hours or by e-mail.  Actually looking forward to Thermo II, if that's possible.  Keep it up Scurvy Scott!!  No  I would recommend this professor to anyone pursuing an engineering degree. I have enjoyed every class I have had with him.  Only real issue I had was when the first homework was due. A few people had never had Dr. Thomas before and did not realize he did homework online. Although it was outlined in the syllabus, he forgot to mention it during the first class causing a few people get 0% on their first homework. For reference, I had Scott previously and was familiar with this policy, but there were a handful of individuals who weren't.  Great experience! Thank you Dr. Thomas!!!!!  It might be worth going through and reviewing the questions for Chapter 12 homework. As I was going through it and the posted solutions, I kept finding equations that I had no idea where they came from until we started Chapter 13. I assume this is in part due to the similar nature of 12 and 13 but it made for a very frustrating time when I couldn't find the formulas being used in the answers. The only other thing is I felt chapter 12 was much harder than chapter 13. Chapter 13 I was actually making sense of and felt I had a decent understanding of after class time and working through the homework.  I really enjoyed my time this semester learning with Dr. Thomas, and I am looking forward to continuing to work with him in the fall in another course!",2017 Spring

Thank you Dr. Menart. One of the best professors who have tought me  James Menart is a very good professor and we need more like him.  Great professor. Thank you for a good semester.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes he would mention something ""one"" time during a lecture and give no example on it or give any further explanation on it (so you would think its not relative, important) but then he would put it on the exam to trip up the students. That is not fair.  I thought the course was really good, some side story and more animation of the subject would be nice. The class is very enjoyable, (I have some class where student just come in and take note and it really dry)  recording the lecture and not giving a grade on the homework were a brilliant idea. This point forced me to take longer time solving and understanding the homework without the fear of the home work grade.

The class was typically spent in a manner well suited to learning but the HW was structured around a self learning ideology which, while it may work well for some, did not help my understanding of the material. The class content does not appear to allow the time for it, however spending the class prior to an exam reviewing the required content would help students in better completing the exam, especially by giving us an idea of what areas to study.  good  Dr. Menart is by the the best instructor for this course.  His examples are very easy to understand and demonstrate the learning subject well.  He is very kind and is always willing to help students, even outside of office hours.  In my opinion, he is the best instructor, overall, in the mechanical engineering program.  Very, very good. Dr. Menart has an uncanny ability to make a student think about the problem. For me personally, he rekindled the excitement about thermodynamics and mechanical engineering. In other words, Dr. Menart made heat transfer look like the most interesting study in the universe.   The topic is very advanced. Only because of his teaching abilities, it seemed easier than even my undergraduate introduction to the topic.  Perfect nothing to point out excellent in teaching  Great  He is a very good speaker. I would rate him 10/10.  Organization: explains clearly, is well prepared, makes difficult topics easy to understand, uses examples, details, analogies, metaphors, and variety in modes of explanation to make material not only understandable but memorable, makes the objectives of the course and each class clear and establishes a context for material  Good teaching Clears the concepts very well Like the teaching method  He has all the materials and good assignment questions for this subject. It is very well prepared and organized. Dr. Menart even has the best knowledge for this subject and explains it very well.  cool most efficient  The style in which Dr. Menart teaches is very effective. His writing notes on the computer makes it much easier to read and follow along, as sometimes writing on the white board is small and difficult to read/follow. He explains things in a very well-thought out way, and I appreciate that given this is a graduate level class.  excellent  Dr. Menart is a great professor. and I think other Professors in mechanical engineering department need to sit in his class and learn how to teach.",2017 Spring

875,ME 7330,James Menart,Question 4,"examples  Homework  Excellent  The instructor demonstrated an interest in our learning by routinely checking in the lectures to see if the concepts were being fully grasped and even adding extensions onto topics to further understanding of the subject.  He was always helpful when asked about homework and did a good job engaging students in class.  By showing live examples.  yes  Tried to engage the class in discussion  Available for questions in office, asks questions in class to check understanding  The instructor was available for consultation during office hours and through email.  He could explain problems in very basic point of view so that all students are able to capture what he taught.  Very well  Best thing about him is, he explains the complex concept starting from basic example, which makes the concept easy. This is what I need.  Yes  good  Dr. Menart is always open to questions and routinely asks questions throughout class to help him gauge the class's understanding of the subject material.  If he finds the class isn't understanding something he will spend the extra time needed before moving on.  He was open to all sorts of questions. I indeed asked many. He encouraged them and after a discussion with him, everything was crystal clear.  Showing some pictures videos and solving problems  By giving us real time applications  pretty good  He stimulates direct, and pace interaction with the class, encourages independent study, conducts quizzes and surprise extra credit tasks(which keeps us on toe ), uses wit and humor effectively. He knows whether or not the class is following the material and is sensitive to students’ motivation and  is concerned about the quality of his/her teaching  Yes very well  By giving good examples and giving applications of the topic in our day to day life which we are studying. Surprise test are the most amazing part, in which we get bonus points as well as a group discussion chance.  very simply way but in details  He explains things multiple times in different ways to help us learn.  yes",2017 Spring

No  His class is worth listening.  no  As previously stated, Dr. Menart is the best instructor for this course.  He makes the material very understandable and the course overall is structured very well.  I can't think of any improvements to the course format.  Yes. I loved this course. It was a privilege. Loved his enthusiasm for the underlying physics and it was contagious. Usually, I breath a sigh of relief when courses are done. This time I am quite a bit disappointed that the course is ending. Also, please know that I am not exaggerating a single bit. He is far better than my opinions suggest. English is my second language, I coukd have put it better in my native language.  He is very interactive and always helps students in parcipating in the classroom  He is a good speaker. His notes are very helpful. Everything perfectly organized. He gives interesting questions in tests.  Prof James Menart is an energetic, dynamic person, seems to enjoy teaching, conveys a love of the field, has an aura of self-confidence, has a thorough command of the field, gives the student a sense of the field, its past, present, and future directions, the origins of ideas and concepts,  presents facts and concepts from related fields,  discusses viewpoints other than his/her own. He is extremely Student Friendly..  Dr. Menart is perfect and one of the best professor Wright State University has.  outstanding  One thing I didn't like about the class is how on exams, we would have to reprove things he did during the notes. In other words, we just do the same thing he did in class. This does nothing to help my understanding of applying the material to solve actual problems. Regurgitating proofs and derivations from the notes on an exam does not help further my understanding of the material. Also, having some stuff on exams that were never even talked about in the notes did not make me happy... Other than this, I felt the class was very worthwhile of my time. I enjoyed it very much!  -  He is great.",2017 Spring
880,ME 4880,Henry Young,Question 1,"good  good  Dr. Young is a brilliant professor who knows the material well. His line of thinking can be hard to follow at times, but his understanding compensates for it when you question him on the material.  Very smart but talks way over everyone's head. Exams were fair due to the fact he tells us what we should know from each chapter. He teaches from PowerPoint which is hard to follow. He's very fair at grading and weighting things in the class. Truely wants you to suceed. Homework is almost impossible to complete and there are little to no examples done in class. The book was a complete waste of money for homework and tests.  Effective, seemed passionate about his topic  Great  Dr. Dan Young is a little bit goofy, but he genuinely enjoys teaching and seems to want to help students as much as possible.  good  a  great professor  Probably the most effective teacher at teaching concepts, which made the class interesting and informative. Dr. Young made this class that was a technical elective I was not interested in, very interesting. I took a lot of knowledge I did not expect to take from this class.  fantastic  I think Dr. Young did a great job. I like how he utilized every lecture to the fullest. I live an hour away and value my time in class. Dr. Young delivered the material in a way that was able to be understood from the lecture notes and reading the book. The book had a more detailed way of understanding the material, which made lecture more understandable if the reading was done before class.  Extremely effective. Not only taught the material well but included relevant bits of knowledge from his personal experiences.  Very effective.

883,ME 4880,Henry Young,Question 4,"He was very excited to relate the material to manufacturing. The class trip that we took to an actual powder metallurgy processing facility was useful in seeing the process in real life. I wish more instructors took class time to show real examples through class trips.  Dr. Young is always referencing work he did while he was in school and while he was doing projects as a young engineer to try to give us some insight on what we will be dealing with once we are working in industry.  good  a  yes he really did  By being energetic and showing a lot of enthusiasm in the subject.  Dr. Young made a great effort to expose students to powder metallurgy. The plant tour was cool and it seemed like Dr. Young would have done anything to get the students to see an actual facility. To me that shows that he is excited about the topic and wants to open our eyes to more than just a lecture.  Takes time to answer questions after class, Took the class to a plant tour which was very interesting.

Lecture notes and homework problems were not similar. The tour was a great experience and should be continued in future classes  good  awesome professor  The plant tour was good. It seemed to be a little short. Its always hard with tours because if you aren't in the front its more of a visual tour. Good clean place though.

The individual group meeting that we had with him were also very productive. Sometimes though it seemed that he was a little on the unorganized size.  great  Fine.  He is really good instructor at Wright State. He is knowledgeable and helpful.  Dr. Young didn't try to delude us into thinking all senior design projects are supposed to have earth-shattering results.

901,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"Yes.  Yes they were.  fairly  Yes  yes  yes  Nooooooo, I was lost most of the time, his lectures are essentially over the reading done the night before, but he will start the lecture going over it, but then go off on tangents often. Confused me on quizzes from information that was used, or just tangential information he just said.  yes  The classes were well organized, but for me personally, the set up of interactive classes does not work very well, as it is more of a teach-yourself the material kind of environment where the professor is there more so to clear things up and for short lectures. This sometimes makes it difficult to actually learn the material correctly.  Somewhat. Perusall, in my opinion, is a good idea but not effective. Online textbooks are just a bad idea in general.  Yes, Dr. Srinivasan had well organized lectures and course content all on the pilot website.  Yes  To some degree due to the class format  No, annotations were a nightmare.

903,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"nope.  The set up of the class is a little odd. I am not the biggest fan of active learning.  Everything involving the annotation homework on perusall was unpleasant and made me lose interest in the course.  no  good teacher  I was going to put song lyrics here to relay my feelings in that way about the class, but honestly I can't think of a good song to show my feelings on it. It was just boring and not really informative.  the perusall annotation software is a joke  No.  The instructor knows what he is doing. But the class methodology is not very good. Perusall is too easy to cheat. Too many people just copied the first definition of a word from Wikipedia and pasted it in the text. Sometimes multiple people highlighted the same word and pasted the exact same definition. It shows exactly how much effort they put into the class. I haven't seen their grades, but I bet they got A's on all their Perusall assignments while I was actually putting in effort to get B's and C's.  Because of Perusall being easy to cheat and the quizzes being simple, I feel like we didn't learn anything.  My recommendation is to change the class to a physical book and doing more traditional classroom work.  Nope.  No  No  I do not like the ""step-up"" learning method. I feel more comfortable with traditional styles of teaching, like doing examples and students asking questions. To me step-up education felt a lot like taking an online course. You are basically 100% on your own with the material. The instructor does little to no lecture, you just read the textbook and do assignments. I once asked for assistance or to see an example and I was told that there are examples in the book (no help help or explanation was provided). The student to professor ratio is way off in these courses. I feel as though Wright State will move to more of this style of classroom due to their financial troubles, which is a shame for the students. We are not receiving a quality education for what we are paying by providing us with this. Sure, I am getting an easy passing grade in the class because it has been dumbed down due to the style of teaching, but I am actually learning nothing. Which is kind of scary when you are pumping out graduating classes every year of engineers who have not been taught everything properly. We will not be taking a final exam in this course thankfully because the entire class would fail it, but I would be interested to see just how bad the scores would be if there were a final exam. You could check the effectiveness of step-up education by giving us a final or pop-quiz at the end of the semester.",2017 Spring

Tests for the failure analysis section also seemed to be extremely specific whereas the lecture slides did not go into that much detail.  Nothing to comment about professor  no  No.  I was so profoundly affected by Dr. Srinivasan's teaching that I sought this course six years after he taught me in a senior elective during my undergraduate program.

912,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 1,"Dr. Amer is very effective overall.  The professor did a great job of explaining the subject. He provided good examples and information in an organized manner. The professor covered a lot of information in an organized fashion.  Best Professor I have had in my 4 years here at Wright State! Incredible professor and extremely knowledgeable. I've never learned so much in a semester before! Professor Amer is one to keep and I am excited to take classes with him in the future, if he is teaching the nanotechnology class next spring I will for sure take it.  Amazing  effective  Presented the material for this course very well.  GREAT INSTUCTOR  taught clearly and very well.  Hard to understand but not bad  Great course  Good  Taught us how to do the problems by giving examples and explaining where the formulas came from.  Short, concise, and effective.  Dr. Amer was very enjoyable and keen.  He constantly asked for questions from the class to ensure that everyone was following and made the lessons palatable and down-to-Earth.  For the most part I think he was effective. There was a couple of times where I was not sure of things going on but was able to get through it.  Dr. Amer was very effective in the instruction of Thermodynamics.  By far one of my favorite professors at wright state. Everything from the beginning was well defined and very clear and he achieved his goal by having me love thermodynamics. This was the class i probably learned the most in and its very useful stuff and would also lighten the mood every once in a while. Explained things well and would always make sure everyone understood before moving on. Would take again in a heartbeat!!!  He taught the material very well! But referred to the book a lot to remember the material.  not effective what so ever. very sloppy handwritting and could never really follow lecture notes. did not learn much from lectures and i attended every class  Very effective and knowledgable  good  Dr. Amer is a very effective instructor. He is passionate about the material, which makes it easy to understand because he knows multiple ways in how to present and solve a problem. He cares about students and making sure that we understand the material we are learning and it applies to real and everyday life and situations. Professor Amer went beyond the basic teaching status to show how important this material is and we as people.  This instructor did an excellent job of teaching the material and helping the class to understand.  I learned a lot from him, including things that weren't part of the syllabus.  Very effective, made the subject very interesting.  Awesome- I came into the semester dreading this subject the most, but Dr. Amer made the material relatable in a step by step method that I really appreciate.  Very effective. I always felt like I understood the concepts and could do the problems  The teacher teaches the class a bit differently than the other teachers, but taught it very well. He focused a lot of the lecture on the concept of what we were learning, so when an example came the student more easily understood what was going on in the problem, The equations were not super clear for the problem but that was on the student to decide. Overall he taught the course very well.  Somewhat effective. His class is basically just doing example problems in class.  Dr. Amer was very effective in his teaching.  Somewhat Effective  Very effective professor. Made me interested in the subject being taught.  Very effective  I respect the professor, his examples are well taught, I learned from him many different things.  Very effective.  very effective. i really enjoy his teaching style and he is more than fair. he made the course enjoyable and applied it to life.  Pretty effective  He explained material well with good organization.  Maher Amer was really effective on the subject thermodynamics. He really made me feel like I wanted to learn more about thermodynamics.",2017 Spring

914,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 3,"Routinely cut class off 20 minutes short to smoke.  The instructor started class on time each day and utilized time as it was needed. He did not hold students in the classroom for an unnecessary amount of time.  He started class on time and would explain what would be covered in the lecture, we always covered everything he initially set out to cover. He would end lecture when he finished covering all of the information for that day then would always ask if we had any questions. Quality over quantity.  Very punctucual  yes  Yes  yes  yes  Good  Always started on time and usually used the entire class time.  Yes.  Yes.  There was a time or two he would be late by a minute or so but for the most part he started class on time.  Dr. Amer always started class on time. He would ask ""How is everyone doing?""...at the very second class was to begin.  There were a few times the full class period wasn't used, but the class covered all of the material we were supposed to. Of course, we could have stayed longer if we had any questions about the material we went over.  Yes, he did.  no, ended early a lot and ended the whole class over a week early as well. could have had those extra days all as review sessions  yes  yes  Dr. Amer did start class promptly at the time we were suppose to start. Most times he used close to the full class period. Some days, if he finished the material early, we were released early.  Yes, class always met on time and for the entirety of the scheduled class time.  We let out early occasionally, but time in class was effectively used.  Class often began on time, and sometimes let out a little early.  yes  Yes  The instructor started the class on time and would use as much time as he needed to get through his desired material, as a result we sometimes got out a little bit early.  He always started class on time, but he routinely ended class at least 30-45 minutes early.  Yes.  Yes  Yes, at times we ended class early, but it wasn't often.  Yes  YESSS  Yes  yes  Always started on time  Yes sometimes ended early, but the material was still taught.  Maher Amer always started the class on time and sometimes he would let us out early but that help us to understand the current chapters without diving into more material. I feel what Maher Amer did was to not overload us with information.",2017 Spring
915,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 4,"He did not, besides calling people out who were distracted during class.  The instructor encouraged questions and seemed to want to help the students have success in his class.  He is one of the few professor that applies an real world application to the topic being discussed, this made it easier to understand and remember. I wished more instructors were like professor Amer, he makes learning thermodynamics something to be excited about.  Made many opportunities to ask questions and answered effectively  yes  By giving examples of real life uses that this course is applicable to.  involvement  yes, very much so  Good  yes.  Genuine interest.  Dr. Amer often told small stories related to Thermodynamics to make the subject more interesting.  He applied Thermodynamic theories to everyday situations to further solidify the ideas we were learning.  He would call on students in class to make sure that they were paying attention. He would tell students that they need to get off of their phones because he cared about them and I believe he did.  Dr. Amer would always ask if we had any questions after EVERY problem that we went through as a class. If you did not understand something, he was happy to help. To further help us understand the topics in Thermodynamics, he would relate the material to real world situations.  Yes, he did.  I enjoyed how he provided real life examples to the problems we did in class. It made the topics less confusing to learn.  i guess  By being passionate about his subject.  good  Dr. Amer showed an interest in my learning because he made connections to things I already knew about and see in everyday life. He didn't allow the material to be limited just in a classroom with notes and what the textbook says. He made the material easily recognizable and to connect to.  He answered all the questions we had, and often probed us to ask more, which was good.  He was very engaging and encouraged questions.  yes  He asked for questions repeatedly to make sure no one was lost in lecture, as well as go over the quiz  answered any and all emails back or in person, and answered questions in class  He would answer any questions that we had to the best of his ability, for the most part.  Dr. Amer demonstrated high interest in my learning by providing office hours, as well as keeping everyone engaged in lectures.  Did not really care  Professor showed care with each student whenever they asked him questions and showed interest in the subject.  Stayed to answer questions after ckass  giving us a real examples that we do in our life  Wanted us to really put our best effort into the course.  said he wanted us to love the class by the end of the semester  Yes, related real life topics and experiences to the material to better our learning.  He gave good many examples of problems with visuals  Explaining the course and the material in an interesting way to help us understand the material more in depth.",2017 Spring
916,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 5,"Well. Expectations were always clear and he did a good job of explaining the material.  The professor seemed to not like emails. He seemed to discourage ""bothering him"" with questions over email. In class he would talk about sending ""pointless"" emails, which deterred me from trying to communicate with him out of the classroom. He did not seem open to extra communication out of the classroom.  Very responsive within reason, if you emailed him a question regarding something stated in lecture he wouldn't respond. I know because he would describe his hilarious emails that he got and share them with the class, he always kept the students anonymous though. If you asked a reasonable question he would explain and answer it clearly, and in a timely manner.  Very Effectively  well  Very effective  great  very effectively  Good  communicated well.  Very well.  Very, very well.  In the classroom I think he communicated well. I never know about outside of class.  Communication with this instructor is great. He is very helpful inside and outside of the classroom. One-on-one help was fantastic during office hours.  He DID NOT like to receive emails!! He would call out the students that sent him emails to complain about them.  So, not the best to communicate with!  not effective, ignored students emails, when he was emailed and read them he would come to class and point that student out in front of the class and make it clear how stupid their email was and that he should not recieve and emails like that again.  effectively  ten out of ten  Dr. Amer always started class with announcements, if there were any that day. He emailed the class as needed if there was something that needed to be clarified or changed.  I would have liked a little clearer communication about if and when assignments were going on Pilot, but most things went pretty smoothly.  He was very effective with communication.  A very good communicator: able to relate complicated topics in easy to understand ways!  Fairly effectively. There were times when I was unsure of what was due or if there was a quiz or not, but otherwise he communicated well  well  He never answered emails and he would call you out in front of the class if you emailed him about any questions. Other than that, he was decent.  Dr. Amer was very effective with communicating to the class.  Not very  Very effective. no-nonsense teacher who was direct and concise with his lectures.

Very much so! :)  Yes, notes then examples. Great way to structure a class  yes  Yes  of coarse  almost always  yes.  Yes.  Yes, the requirements and expectations were clearly listed and taught in a particular order.  I believe so. It went in an order that we were able to understand and accomplish. He was able to time everything out very well.  Yes.  For the most part, yes.  no. not at all.  yes  well organized  Dr. Amer had his pilot organized very simple and easy, which is very nice. Lecture was well organized by doing announcements, notes and problems, and then reiterating what was covered in class and the objectives of the material we just learned.  The instructors handwriting was a bit hard to read at times, and the instructor spoke a bit quietly, but after some quick adjustments on my part it was not a problem.  Yes.

918,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 7,"Yes  I never tried to contact the professor through any of these means.

However, he was not good at telling the students when homework and quizzes would be uploaded to pilot.  Yes  Yes  yes  Yes  hell yea  yes  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, Dr. Amer either answered questions in class or responded to email very quickly.  If I would have went then I believe he would have been. He really did not like emails though.  Yes.

919,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 8,"Dr. Amer called people out during class in two instances that I noticed he should not have. He stopped during lecture to ask someone if they were registered with ODS. He also called me out for taking a make-up exam in front of the class, knowing that I had undergone a traumatic experience that caused me to need to make it up. He was contacted through Student Support Services.  The professor did well in instructing the class. However, I hope in the future he is more open to emails and willing to be more open about expectations for exams. In doing so, students would be capable of studying more effectively for the topics on the exams.  AWESOME!! PROFESSOR AMER IS THE BEST!  Amazing professor and I hope to take more courses with him!  no  Enjoyed being in this class and would take this instructor again.  HE IS FUNNY AF  My only suggestion is to have more quizzes. If a student were to get 2 or 3 of the large point quizzes wrong, it becomes impossible to get the required 60% minimum average for the quiz section. Because most of the 10 quizzes are 5 or 10 points, messing up one 50 point quiz would give you the same score as a student that just chose not to do 5 of the smaller ones. Which does not really seem fair. When each quiz took about equal amounts of time and effort to complete.  Great professor, very practical.  I was only disappointed with the class during the Final for two reasons: one, that the formula sheet provided was not very useful, and two that 50/100 points of the exam were in a question that (to my knowledge) was never covered by the homework.   All the questions needed at least one formula that was not on the formula sheet.  Having a formula sheet suggests that students can focus on studying theory, but on the final this was not the case.  I have done very well in this class up to that point.  I feel like my abilities on the final were not properly assessed, and that being able to properly use a given formula is more important than whether or not you bet on memorizing the correct formulas.  I, apparently, did not 'bet' on having formulas like Polytropic Work at the ready for the final. I'm not trying to place the blame on Dr. Amer, nor am I insinuating that he attempted to ""pull a fast one"" on the class.  From a student perspective, however, I felt unprepared for the final for silly reasons instead of lack of study.  I think he is a little intimidating in class. The way he would answers would come off as mean. It hindered me from asking questions a time or two. He always welcomed questions though.  Dr. Amer not only instructed me on the material of Thermodynamics, he also showed me that I LOVE the subject. I hope I have the opportunity to take more of his classes in the future.  I would take another class with him.  But hopefully he will get better on responding to emails, and office hours!  bad, boring class, hanging on by a thread.  no  Great instructor. Very fair, would take a class with him again.  No.  I love Thermodynamics.  my favorite instructor in the entire university by far. the only negative thing i would have to say is that when it is test time he says he wants you to study everything for the test but he doesnt put everything on the tests. when the tests only have 3 questions and you really mess one up you get a bad grade.

Dr. Haung was a great communicator during and outside of class. Emails were usually responded to within a day or less.  Dr. Huang is great at communication with the class. Whenever a new assignment is posted on pilot she was sure to let us know in class that day or via email.

944,ME 3310,J. Wolff,Question 1,"Good.  Decently effective, has trouble putting the information at the same level as the class.  Very good instructor, but may expect too much from students.  He was a great professor, I just wish I had the discipline to make it to the 8 AM more to hear him teach more thermos. #LethimteachFluids  Okay  He is one of the best professor that I've ever had. Explained and gave great examples.  Very effective.  Pretty effective, though sometimes he falls behind in lectures and we end up turning in hw that has content that wasn't covered in class yet.  Dr. Wolff has done an incredible job in terms of relaying information to students as well as having impeccable effectiveness.  He taught the material well.  He wasn't the best professor I've ever had. Class was very fast paced and a lot of steps were skipped in examples. Also tests were quite hard and the fact that our design project was only worth 2% of our grade didn't feel like it was even worth the time doing it.  Very effective instructor. Extremely passionate about the topic.  I can't say that I learned a whole lot from each lecture, but he was passionate about what he teaches and tried his best to get us to understand although his explanations were not always relatable to those who are completely new to the subject having no prior knowledge of thermodynamics.  There were some things that he didn't explain well that he should have explained but he eventually went over it when he saw that kids were having problems with it.  Fairly effective.  Pretty effective  Dr. Wolff I found was a pretty effective professor.  The instructor tried to be helpful but had a tough time explaining the basics which resulted in confusion when learning the tougher part of the course as shown by our class exam averages.  Knowledgeable but not effective in the sense if a student was struggling with the content.  The student was left to try to understand material without help from the instructor.

Always answered questions  Yes he is passionate that we understand how what we are doing now is important for the work we will be doing as engineers in the real world.  He gave some real examples and even talked about his work that he has did or was working on  to explain the importance of it.  It was evident through his teaching that he took an interest in our learning. In addition, we covered Exergy and the Otto/Brayton cycle, which other sections did not, as he felt these were important topics for future engineers to know.  .  Yes  Yes, he was interested in our learning. But he was so ""interested"" that he made a already difficult course much more difficult.  he was very enthusiastic towards out learning of the material.

Could easily follow the fluidity of the course  Yes, he would well organized for the most part  For the most part some lectures were a little speratic  Yes  Course content and lectures did not seem to have much structure but I would attribute that to the nature of the subject and the mass amount/variety of material that had to covered.  He was well organized with it all.  Yes.  Yes  Yes  they were very organized, but the lectures didn't match the exams very well. I don't believe they should match up exactly, but i do believe the content on the exams should be something we have seen before. Which wasn't the case for the second exam.

951,ME 3310,J. Wolff,Question 8,"nope.  The only problem is sometimes Dr. Wolff has trouble conveying information to the students at this level. Overall a good instructor and caring of the students.  Very good instructor, but tests had way too much content for the time given and the number of hours spent on homework and quizzes doubled all my other classes put together.  Too much content was covered in the class. Although examples were gone over in class, it was hard to follow and fully understand. Class was taught as if geared toward students further in the ME program/upperclassmen, yet suggested to be taken sophomore year according to the ME program guide.  Only thing is that he seemed to make the subject a little harder than it should be for a thermo 1 class but because of that i believe i know thermo better. Great professor.  wolff is serious but hes willing to help and he cares. His class is not for people looking to skate by but for people who want to learn.  Good Professor , fair grader  Dr. Wolff has done a phenomenal job teaching thermo especially when i had no idea what the course was to begin with. I am more than excited to have him for one of my future classes.  He either needs to make the exams a little easier or curve because there hasn't been an average that's passing on the exams all semester.  He was always showing his passion for teaching. He isn't the best teacher I've had but he always has passion to help the kids and teach the subject and that's what more teachers need. I feel like I learned a lot from him throughout the semester and I'm thankful I had him for that.  Overall hes a good teacher and a nice guy. But he has very high expectations for his students. I do also believe the homework should be weighted a bit more. Exams are 90% of our grade and homework, quizzes and a design project were only worth a combined 10%.  no  Nope.",2017 Spring

He is very smart professor.  Josh is a great instructor. He makes his notes and other resources on pilot available which makes understanding course content much easier. Examples covered in notes and in class were excellent and helped illustrate the concepts. Homework could be challenging at times, however, students who performed well were rewarded accordingly.

Anything from genetic algorithms to current research projects. Josh was always willing to dive into information students are interested in.  He was very interested in the students' learning and showed this by being available to answer questions in office hours and providing good insight both in and out of the classroom.  He used visuals and MATLAB programs to justify the use of the equations and how stuff works overall.  We scheduled time after class to explain things  to me.  Yes, Instructor was always interested in understanding of his student. He would give different practical example to support theory which would create student interest in learning.  -Instructor used to ask questions during class that allow me to think on that topic.

967,ME 7080,Joshua Deaton,Question 8,no  I think the material is very interesting even while difficult. My hindrance in this class is my coding ability. There's no real way to get around that except if more Matlab courses were taught to undergrads; maybe one each year?  No  Josh does a fantastic job as an instructor. He is very clear in his explanations of complex topics. This has easily been one of my favorite classes that I have taken at WSU.  He is an excellent instructor.

968,ME 4250,Koorosh Gobal,Question 1,"Dr. Gobal did well. I believe this was his first class and it seems that he did a good job in covering useful subject matter and making his exams look like what he taught. Some professors do not have this skill... Kinematics is an interesting subject and he did a good job to keep it that way.  All the information was there... IF you could keep up.  Decent to good effectiveness. Some topics were vague/confusing.  did not seem too interested in teaching the subject  Very clear that he is a new professor. His ability to explain things could use improvement.  Pretty effective  God awful. The worst overall class ive taken at wright state. Professor talked extremely quiet and did not explain material. The final class project was extremely vague and could essentially be boiled down to ""design something"". Asked multiple times about what specifically needed to be in report and still got no real answers and the professor would routinely change what he said the next time i answered. Horrible professor horrible class. i would wish this class on my worst enemies  Very effective  He just got his PhD, so he was new. Much of the homework was too difficult and I didn't get much out of it. Because I didn't do well on the homework, I still had trouble when it came time for exams. The reviews before the exams were very useful however.  Too difficult- hard to learn  A good instructor. It's my understanding that this is his first semester teaching. I think he did okay for it being his first time. After a few more semesters he'll be very good.  Dr. Gobal spent a lot of time on graphical methods that are impractical and useless. I understand it was his first time teaching the course, however, he should consider teaching the material that we can actually use. This is especially true considering Kinematics is an elective course.  The book taught me better than he did, and all he did was read parts of the book aloud.  Professor was good at explaining the subject but the examples explained in the class weren't sufficient to solve the homework. Questions from the comparatively tough to what we have learned in the class. Need more hard work of students to get average score in the exams. The time provided was not sufficient for solving the type of questions given.  teaching method is good, proper planning for every classes, make revision of all topic after end of the chapter. finally, he has given his good effort to teach his subject.  Dr. Gobal is very helpful. His teaching methodology is extremely well organized. He explains every topic followed by an example, which gives proper understanding of that topic.  Dr. Gobal taught the course very well. He taught all the topics in an effective manner which was very understandable and clarified the doubts raised which made the understanding of the subject even more easier which was very helpful.",2017 Spring
969,ME 4250,Koorosh Gobal,Question 2,"Yes  Yes  Yes  yes, but exam expectations were not always very clear  Not really. Student expectations are greatly over the top. All of the matlab he expected us to be able to do was ridiculous.  Yes  Not really  Yes  Yes.  No  Yes  Yes, the expectations listed in the syllabus were well defined. The homework, however, seemed like busy work. We were assigned 4 programming assignments a week over the same material. One should have been sufficient considering the material is the same.  Not at all.  When it comes to exam evaluation the instructor reduced marks even for a slightest mistake.  yes but he would have  done more practice of tough examples to us which he asked in exam.  Dr. Gobal is consistent in evaluating the work done by students.

No, he always started early which mean it hard for those of us who had class right before on the other side of campus make it to lecture in 3 minutes to not miss any of the lecture  Yes, The instructor was punctual for every class and he also uses full class time effectively with prior planning.  yes, he did.  Yes, Dr. Gobal always start class on time and use the full class period.

Encouraged us to ask questions in class if we were ever confused  Nope  The instructor was very open to questions  He was available after class and office hours and would explain things I did not understand.  I have had hrad time to understand  He made sure to stop so that we could ask questions, and periodically check that we were following along. He also posted lots of helpful material to Pilot.  Yes, he always asked the class if we had any questions. I think it would have been more useful had he assigned the same project to the entire class so that the grading could be more objective. It seems like the project is more of a grade buffer and not meaningful.  Not at all. He was impersonal and could care less  He always asks students for any doubt clarifications after each topic and he explains it to all the students so that all students with the same doubt can understand.  he has given us project, which was based on to design a real world problem with improvement on it, so, he has demonstrate interest through it.  I used to meet Dr. Gobal on regular basis to solve my difficulties. Since then he started taking interest in my learning.  Dr. Gobal taught the subject in a well manner which made the subject interesting and he taught all the topics well and gave various examples to those topics both in classwork and homework which made us understand the topic even more easily. For further better understanding of the course he gave a project in this course while demonstrating the project it gave even more interest in the course.",2017 Spring
972,ME 4250,Koorosh Gobal,Question 5,"Great, I was most impressed with how quickly he would answer email responses. This is extremely helpful when you can't make it on campus but still, have a question. He was reachable at pretty much all working hours as well as the weekend.  Sometimes it was a little rough. He'd blaze through a method and I'd be stuck 6 lines back trying to figure out what some operation was, he'd ask ""questions?"" (no responses, everyone still scribbling and staring at the board) ""good."" (moves on). But like I said, once I got my questions formulated he did a great job of making sure I got straightened out. Always verified that my concerns were alleviated.  He tried hard to ensure that we all understood the topics covered but sometimes his explanations didn't help and created more confusion when asked about it.  never communicated with him  Decently.  Pretty effective  Terribly  Very effectively  He was available after class and office hours and would explain things I did not understand.  80%  On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say he was about a 5 or 6 in effectiveness of communication of the material. I think it's possible that the course topic on its own is already extremely challenging to convey compared to other subjects like mech design or thermodynamics. If he were teaching it different course it's a possibility that I'd rate him higher.  Dr. Gobal communicates well in and outside of the classroom.  The instructor is so friendly and he is always ready to help students in and out of the class  he communicated very politely and every time he helped me to solve my problems related subject.  Dr. Gobal replies to all the queries in and out of class and sometimes he gives suggestions on what should be done. He treats every student equally.  Dr. Gobal clarified all the doubts in any part of the topic.

975,ME 4250,Koorosh Gobal,Question 8,"My only issue is that the homework seemed impossible at times. The homework was HEAVILY Matlab based and many students spent more time trying to learn more advanced Matlab than actually trying to learn the subject. This made it difficult when trying to use homework to prepare for exams. I would expect the homework grades to be relatively low compared to exam grades in this class.  I enjoyed your class Dr Gobal! Sorry I wasn't a better student! I really do feel like I learned a lot about kinematics, even though I had looks of confusion, worry, and panic on my face most of the time in lecture.  Good teacher for the most part. I just felt like some topics weren't covered in the best way. He did plenty of examples but cut out some steps that should be known. It's nice to see each step and how he gets the answers instead of the current method.  does not  write very clear on board  Horrible Horrible Horrible  This class would have been much easier if the homework was easier and if we had more examples during lecture. Homework would have been better if we had more problems but each problem took less time.  Yes exam should be take home  The course is too hard  I think Dr. Gobal did well considering this was his first time teaching. I hope Wright State decides to keep him around.  The instructors needs to provide more and complicated examples related to the topics for good understanding. The time should be provided to complete the exam based on the question paper.  Nope, that,s all for him.  Dr. Gobal is always ready to help each and every student in class and he is very supportive.",2017 Spring

983,ME 7340,Jose Camberos,Question 8,"Overall Dr. Camberos is highly knowledgeable in the field of CFD. However, I don't think his expectations of Wright State Students are where they should be. This one of our highest level thermal-fluids classes. In the final two weeks, we arrived at the equations of fluid mechanics. By comparison, other universities are there at week 4. Maybe this isn't a problem with Dr. Camberos' teaching style though. The department could easily speed this class up by making the advanced engineering math class a prerequisite. Finite differences and PDEs are covered in great detail the math class. It is a waste of Dr. Comberos's time and ours to cover PDE solutions and simple finite differences. Of course, these techniques applied to the equations of fluid mechanics should be covered in great detail. Aside from making an additional class period, I enjoyed Dr. Camberos' class. But I really think the ME department should consider restructuring the CFD class to be more in line with other universities.  No.  no  No  Recombine the first two homework assignments. This may help to get through all the material. Also give the intro to the project at least a month before it is due, when you only give a week, it is just a huge homework assignment and students cannot budget time to do it well so close to the end of the semester when everything else is occurring, i.e., other class projects, thesis defenses, etc.  As a precursor to the following statements, I had no CFD knowledge prior to this course.  My fluids knowledge was limited to undergraduate Fluid Mechanics. Several improvements can be made to the structure of this course that would benefit the students.  A signficant amount of time was spent on finite difference theory.  The class spent quite a while on deriving finite differences.  Including how to derive the finite difference equation from a Taylor Series Expansion and how the finite difference can be used to discretize the governing PDEs.  This could be condensed into half-a-class (40 minute) review.  This should be covered in the pre-reqs, and is covered in other classes as well.  I did not have all the pre-reqs for the class, but I have taken EGR-7030 and MTH-6050. •	EGR-7030: Covers during the finite difference equations and the use of various numerical methods (i.e. Runge-Kutta). •	MTH-6050: Covers the analytical solution of PDEs using Fourier series and introduces solving PDEs numerically using the finite difference methods.  Also teaches the Crank-Nicolson method for Laplace equations. Stability analysis is not covered in these classes, so that should be kept in the class.  This is relatively simple and should be able to be taught in one class period. The more advanced finite difference methods (i.e. DuFort-Frankel, Lax-Friedrich, Lax-Wendroff) should still be covered as they are not covered in the other classes.  However, with the pre-req knowledge students should be able to easily understand how the equation was discretized, how it was modified after discretization (i.e. let u_j = 0.5*[u_j+1 + u_j-1]).  The majority of the time on these equations can spent on showing that the modifications lead to favorable stability characterisitics. All of the above should be able to be accomplished fairly quickly.  The application of these methods should be demonstrated in class. It would be helpful to the class if these methods were coded up by the instructor during class and the class could follow along since we were in a computer lab.  This could be accomplished quickly for a simple 1D example. A much greater amount of time needs to be dedicated to the finite volume methodology.  In the course this semester, finite difference was hammered hard (too hard) and finite volume was very very breifly touched on and then was not covered again until the last two weeks of class when it was time to start working on the project.   Instead, after finite difference is covered (relatively quickly) for 1D problems the finite volume method needs introduced.  The FVM process needs to be described thoroughly and methodically as it is very unlikely the FVM method is covered is any other course (unlike finite difference).  Then, the  equivalent of all the FD schemes needs to be implemented in class.   Granted the FVM won’t be much different from the FDM for 1D problem it is probably the most logical place to introduce it. Extension to 2D problems will be relatively simple for the FDM method, but it should still be covered in a way that students can see how the algorithms are extended in a second direction.  This was they can easily extend the algorithms to a third dimensions on their own if needed in the future.  This is where the most time on the FVM should be spent as it will show the difference between the FDM and FVM method more clearly.  Additionally, it wasn’t covered in this class but how to solve a problem on an unstructured grid, using the FVM, should be taught.  As I understand it, this is one of the largest benefits of the FVM method.  Also, sinc e the FVM is the most widely used in practice, it only makes sense this should be covered more thouroughly. Additionally, I think the full Navier-Stokes equations should be introduced in the first week of class.  This isn’t unreasonable, as it was done in the first week of Convective Heat and Mass Transfer.  This way students can see the full level of physics that are being modeled.  Then as start learning in 1D, incompressible, inviscid example we can be shown how the NS equations are simplied to reach the governing PDEs for this case.  Then when we move to 2D, then compressible, then viscid we can do the same thing and see what simplifications are made to the NS equations to reach the governing PDEs for that case.  I feel this would help a lot especially when we get to the Euler equations and we start using flux vectors.  This makes it significantly easier to understand what each component of the state vector and the flux vectors means.  With an understanding of that, will come a much better understanding of the Euler equations and solution methods for them. More time should be spent on flux vector splitting.  The different ways in which it can be split, what this means physically and mathematically, when it is and isn’t necessary, and how it is implemented in both the FDM (studied first, but quickly) and then the FVM (studied in more detail). The time spent on each portion of the class material didn’t seem adequately distributed.  Far too much time was spent on simple to understand concepts which are either partially or totally covered in pre-reqs, and not enough time was spent on actual CFD applications rather than just numerical methods.  If we plotted it with time on the x-axis and material covered on the y-axis, it was almost seem like a linear curve with a very small slope over the first 9 weeks and then the curve suddenly turns exponential and rises very rapidly over the last few weeks.   I feel it should be more of a exponential curve at the beginning quickly covering the simple numerical method type of things (which should be review from pre-reqs) and then when we rich the more advanced material (FVM, Euler equations, etc as decribed above).  The curve should become more linear as we progress more slowly and carefully through the new, more advanced, material we haven’t seen in other classes. Once again, I would like to iterate that I had no CFD experience before this class.  Not in any other classes (except undergraduate Fluid Mechanics) and not in research.  I started learning CFD at the beginning of this course.  I did go beyond the course by watching the ME-702 CFD lecture videos from Boston University on YouTube and working through the 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes python modules during the first two and a half weeks of class.  These are linked in the sources at the bottom.  I feel the ME-702 lecture videos should be more of how the class is structured, but still with more emphasis on the FVM, flux-splitting, and the Euler equations than even the ME-702 lectures presents. This is the highest level of CFD that WSU offers. It is a 7000 level class, but I don’t feel the content is repesentative of that.  Students who take the 7000 classes are driven, capable, students.  I feel WSU needs to be more confident in their students abilities and teach this CFD course at a level that will bring students to a high enough level that they could enter a career based in CFD and perform adequately, albeit at an entry level at first, without a lot of hand holding for their co-workers. Please note that the above is a criticism on the course content and not on the teaching ability of Dr. Camberos.  However, I do have some suggestions how how he may be able to make some changes to his teaching methods that may allow students to understand the content better.  I, personally, have never met a student who has learned material well simply from the instructor lecturing from powerpoints,  especially for a class like this.  I think if the instructor notes were a little more organized and were written up on the board as students followed along would be effective.  The powerpoints could be used as supplemental material which could be reference for graphs, tables, etc., and studied in detail by students in their own time if they don’t have a sufficient understanding of the material from the lecture.  Dr. Camberos relied more on the powerpoints at the beginning of the course, but got much better at writing notes on the board and doing examples toward the end of the course.  Additionally, many of the algorithms are simple enough that they can be coded up together in class.  I think this would be better than providing pre-written code for students to use.  Its very easy to take pre-written code, modify it to make it do something else, without actually understanding how it works.  When I was a senior, for part of my senior design project I wrote a C++ code and GUI that took inputs from the keyboard and trasmitted it wireless to a robot for control.  I knew no C++ at the time and to this day I’m still amazed how I was able to piece it together and get it working from a variety of StackOverflow questions and code snippets without having a sufficient understanding of what was going on.  So for class, I would have a volunteer come up and run the computer to start implementing the code.  The rest of the class can help out in describing how the algorithm can be implemented and the instructor can assist if he sees the class struggling.  I think this would give the class a better understanding of the implementation of each algorithm.  Also, since this is computational fluid dynamics, computational time is important and should be reduced as much as possible.    Granted this isn’t a course teaching how to optimize numerical algorithms or their implementation for speed, but some basic thing should be mentioned.  For example, many of the posted MATLAB examples relied VERY heavily on for loops.  For loops are awfully slow in interpretted languages such as MATLAB and Python and instead vectorized operations should take their place (MATLAB vectors/matrices and Python Numpy).  Granted real CFD takes place in Fortran, C, or C++ for which for loops are still efficient, but as the vast majority of WSU engineering students (unfortunately) do not know these languages, it should at least be mentioned how CFD can be made more efficient in MATLAB (vectorizatoin). Overall, I enjoyed this course. I’ve always been interested in CFD and I greatly enjoyed learning about it.  I just feel like all of us could have learned so much more in the time we had, esepcially with the extra, unscheduled, class on Fridays.  For example, look at the CFD class from Notre Dame (link in sources below).  They are doing Euler Equations by the end of Feburary  (and they started later than us also, Jan. 18th) while we started Jan 9th and we didn’t get to the Euler equations until later March / early April. The CFD content at WSU is far behind other universities. With minor tweaks to Dr. Camberos’ teaching methodology and a major restructuring of the course content, I believe WSU can have one of the best CFD courses in the country. One other thing that comes to mind.  Far too much emphasis is put on writing a report for each homework.  I understand the importance of having strong technical writing skills and I have often heard employers are not satisfied with today’s graduates’ writing abilities.  However, this is not the place to teach that.  Students are paying for a course on CFD.  All teaching emphasis, and especially all grading should be placed on CFD and how well the student is capable of solving CFD problems accurate.  This isn’t the course to grade if a student has proper grammar and writing style, there are WSU courses dedicated solely to that (3000 level technical writing course).  Students would be greatly benefitted by removing the report requirement for each homework and assigning additional CFD problems.  On average, I probably spent 70% of the time writing up the report and only spent 30% of the time actually learning CFD concepts on each homework.   P.S.  Do a “12 Steps to Navier-Stokes” type of module written in MATLAB (since most WSU engineering students only know MATLAB and not Python) would probably work great as a learning tool for the course.
