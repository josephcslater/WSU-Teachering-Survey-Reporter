10,Allen Jackson,2016 Summer,ME 3600,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Very well run class despite a terrible book. Dr. Jackson provided many examples to thoroughly explain the topic. He also provided real world situations and examples which many professors do not. :: Pretty bad professor. Didn't make attendance mandatory and the classes were a joke so only 10 students including myself consistently showed up to class. His labs were a joke. I didn't learn a single thing from the labs. Went over examples in class but would just show the book solution to the problem and wouldn't actually work the problem out. Also would make tons of mistakes in his work and would get lost all of the time. Couldn't read his handwriting. Bad professor and am disappointed that he is teaching senior lab. The material for this class is also dumb, most engineering jobs will never use this. :: He was often very unclear while explaining the subject matter, to the point of further confusing the class. :: yes. :: Teaching aspect overall is fine. :: The instructor is very respectful and his level of understanding students' cases is highly appreciated, however this subject needs to reconsidred to have better and more useful matrials to get real benefits from it. :: Dr. Jackson has an odd at times, but very hands on approach to teaching. He always answered questions in class to the best of his ability, and made problems as clear as possible so everyone would be able to understand what he was explaining. :: i like his way by practicing the problems in the class. :: asdf"
11,Allen Jackson,2016 Summer,ME 3600,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes, through examples given in class, homework, lab problems, and test preparation. :: not really. :: no. :: Typical instructor aids: readings and problems. :: Actually not at all because this subject has many matrials are not useful. It should be more consantratied on only important materials. :: Yes, he did. I went into this class with nearly no real knowledge of what it was going to be about, and through the lab and lecture sessions I have learned a great deal of things that before I probably wouldn't have either noticed or accounted for. :: asdf"
12,Allen Jackson,2016 Summer,ME 3600,Question 13,Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- yes. :: The course content seemed to be random in flow and building over the course but overall ok. :: This class should not a required class for Mechanical Engineering. :: `asdf

24,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Summer,ME 4140,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- very unclear on the project. :: Dr. Bae is very kind and very intelligent, but I personally had a lot of difficulties with this class.  The biggest issue for me was that the problems that we went over in class were often left untested, and the test questions were barely explained in class.  While I understand that the questions on an exam have to be somewhat different than what has been covered in class, so that they are not too easy, but we would often spend a lot of time on a few subjects in class, only to never see them again on the exam.  The third quiz in particular was difficult for most people because we did very few problems like the ones on the quiz in class.  Most of the examples were over beam bending, and then the quiz was almost entirely over springs.  It's difficult for me to know how to do something if I haven't been shown a general example on how to do it.  Otherwise, I felt that I had a good understanding of the things that were covered in class. :: yes, but grading was not totally fair sine the TA was grading our midterms, where the TA knows some students in the class as friends and gave them a score more than they deserve. :: Good. :: Bae is one of the worst instructors Wright State has. Does not care about the students at all. After every exam he would tell students who got below a 50 on it to simply drop the class. Other good professors would care more about their students and say stuff like come see me in office hours or work a little harder on homework or studying, not Bae. He just simply says if you got below a 50 I'd drop the class. Also his exams were nothing at all like the material we covered in class. For example our third exam consisted of two spring problems and we didn't cover a single spring problem throughout the course of the semester. Everyone did terrible on the exam and it was like he was surprised that everyone did bad. Terrible professor I would never take him again. Also if he didn't have his notes in front of him during lectures he wouldn't know the material worth a shit. His notes are the only reason he can even solve problems. For example his TA taught the class one day using his notes and did just as good of a job as Bae did. Anyone who could read could teach his class. :: good. :: he some how explain, but he gives us an easy example in class but in the quiz's he gave us really hard problem to solve. :: Very clear in explaining and examples were really helpful. :: His accent didnt stop him from making sure everyone understand this class.  Simply the best professor I had so far. :: He is very kind but tough to understand sometimes. he goes way too fast on lectures and don't give time to understand well. :: Very clear in his explanations. Overall an excellent teacher. Sometimes though, you barely hear what he says, because of his accemt. However, overtime, you get use to it. :: He went through things way too quickly. It may have been because it was a summer semester but he still flew through chapters as if we should've already known the material he was teaching and all of it was just a review. :: asdf. :: I feel the teacher did a good job answering questions that were irregular. :: Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae is one of the best professor ever. I learnt this subject very interestingly. And He explain us all theory with an examples step by step. He convert all difficult subject theory into easy and interesting subject."
25,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Summer,ME 4140,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- homework did not go with what he was teaching. :: Dr. Bae did very well trying to understand and answer students' questions appropriately and accurately. :: yes. :: Good. :: good. :: no he did no. he did not give us the question problem during the class time. we asked him. he told us just to search on them in book. :: Yes. Explains everything in details which let us learn more. :: Mech design is not an easy class, with this teacher it was easy enough to break any problem down to a simple stuff so we can solve it. :: yes. :: Of course, Dr. Bae is very helpful instructor and the good thing in his class he try to join the class with reality through explain the topic and its application in life. also many time he refers to advantage and disadvantage of some topics depend on his experience.  i really enjoyed in his class and hope to take more classes with him. :: Made himself available during his office hours to properly explain materials that were not understood during the lecture. :: At times. Sometimes he would answer questions very well but other times he would stand there and look at the students as if they asked the dumbest questions. :: asd. :: Yes, I was interested in contact forces and he gave me food for thought when I asked during class. :: Yes, Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae teach us Mechanical Design-1 very well. And the method as he teach us by point to point is like by every student of class."
26,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Summer,ME 4140,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- needs to post homework with a week notes. :: One major issue that I took with this course was that the homework was often assigned on either a Wednesday, to be due on a Monday, or a Saturday, to be due Wednesday.  This was very difficult to schedule with other classes and work.  It always took a lot of time to do the homework because the questions assigned were not very similar to the in-class examples, so that meant that there was not much time available to do an assignment that was very difficult.  This ended up taking time away from studying for the quizzes, and actually made the course more difficult.  We need more time for the homework assignments and they need to be questions that practiced what we went over in class. :: Great. :: good. :: He did not give us any extra work. He told us he can not. HOW!! he is a professor of this course and all of the professors does.!!!!. :: dd. :: No further comment. :: asdf. :: All in all this was a great class! A lot of material for the summer. :: I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae for teach us very difficult subject with his excellent Technic and convert it into easy and interesting subject. In future, If I have a change to get any subject related to my field, I will not hesitated and I am sure, I will take that definitely.  Thank You Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae"
27,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Summer,ME 4140,Question 14,"Additional comments--- give are tests back stop worrying about crap  His tests are out of control they nothing like what he teaches!!!!!!!!. :: Bad teacher, the whole class struggled throughout the semester. What he taught in class was clear enough to understand/follow along, but the exams were no where near what he taught in class. :: I think that Dr. Bae will be a very good teacher for this course, once he has it a little more organized. :: none. :: Thank you. :: good. :: .. :: Very good professor. Would take any of his classes again, and would highly recommend anyone to take him. :: asdf. :: I will definitely suggest to take classes under him.  Thank You Very much Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae."

38,Zifeng Yang,2016 Summer,ME 3350,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- the instructor is very good at what he is doing. he was clair all the time and his notes were very helpful. :: Instructor gives good examples and answers all questions. :: He was well organized. :: Explained everything in depth to the point that we all could understand it. :: good teacher. :: Felt rushed in the end. We were going really fast and more examples would've helped me understand better. :: Went over the theory first, then went on to solve multiple examples which was ideal. :: Very good examples in class. :: The professor was very clear and respectful of everyone. :: Zifeng is a great professor, I had him for thermo and was very glad to see him as my instructor for fluids. I like the way he presents notes in class and works through examples. His exams are very fair also. :: the instructor explains the material really well. he was clear and confidant about the material. :: Good. :: Went over a lot of examples in class and had good course notes and everything. I thought he did a good job teaching for the most part. I was upset though with the final exam schedule. I had three final exams in one day and his exam overlapped with both of the other exams due to the fact that he extended his exam period by 20 minutes. I asked him a week in advance if I could take the final exam a day early so that my exams wouldn't overlap and so I wouldn't have three finals in one day. He said the only choice I had was to take it 2 days early which was before he even covered all of the material that was going to be on the exam as well as going over the final review. The reason he gave was that if I took it two days early it would be less work for him. This in my opinion is bull crap because the final was worth 50% and I had to take it on a day that two other exams fell on and I had to leave the other exam periods early or show up late to accommodate for his final. :: Good. :: great teacher. :: Very well. :: The professor was clear in his explanations and had the students understanding as a priority.  He was understanding and willing to work with my inability to attend the first three classes, and it all worked out well. :: He covered relevant examples and the same information that was in the book so I could go back and find the same info he covered. :: he is a good instructor's for this specific class. :: Very clear in explaining a difficult subject. His ability to take problems through a step by step process to give us time to understand was a big help. :: instructor did examples and explained the theory behind most of the subject.  very good instructor. :: Bad. :: Clear and knowledgeable. I feel like to much time was spent on going through the derivations of the higher level concepts, while this is beneficial in a graduate course I'm sure, at the undergraduate level I think example problems are more helpful than derivations. :: He explained concepts with examples and notes."
39,Zifeng Yang,2016 Summer,ME 3350,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- yes very much, specially with the class problem and examples. :: Yws, his examples were very clear. :: yes. :: yes by explains the concept of the subject. :: Yes. when given a question he would explain it in further detail if it was needed. examples in class helped a lot for hw assignments. :: yes, would ask interesting questions to get you thinking about what he was teaching about. :: yes, explains things very well. :: Yes. :: Yes very clear explanations. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Good. :: Yes. :: He is one of the best teachers in the Mechanical Engineering department. :: great teacher. :: Yes. :: He did a good job at explaining the content and the examples we went through.

If I could change one thing it would be the weight of the exams. Not being a good test taker, and having the final exam being worth half my grade makes for a stressful combination. :: No. :: Thanks. :: Also this class is a joke because no one will ever use this material again in their lives.

52,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5350,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Dr. Sucosky is a fantastic lecturer. He uses time well and balances theory with example problems well. He answers questions thoroughly. :: When teaching, the professor would hand write the notes with the class so the students learned the material in real time and would not have to worry about falling behind. Also, Sucosky will provide handouts so that students just have to fill in blanks of the steps of the problems that way they do not always have to draw out every diagram and write out every note or definition. :: Handouts were very helpful but wish we had received them at the beginning of the semester rather than each week. Also would help if the derivative and partial derivative symbols were more clear to read. :: The examples in class and handouts follow the homework very well. This contributed to my learning as I was able to study the handouts to learn the problems and this provided a very effective combination overall. :: Did a very good job of teaching the diffuclt material. Handout helped a lot. If you didn't have a full understanding he was always available for office hours. :: Handouts were very helpful. Notes/lectures well organized. :: I think Dr. Sucosky did an amazing job teaching a very complicated subject. Fluid dynamics is a hard class but with the way he sets it up, the way he teaches and how well structured his class is, he makes the class a lot more doable. :: Very informative and great all around professor. Broke down theory and calculations very well . Able to convey the material to all students effectively with little to no issue. :: Dr. Sucosky taught this class perfectly. All examples were very relevant to the content that was being taught at the time, and his us of vocabulary in lectures was perfect; not too sophisticated that it went way over our heads, and not too unsophisticated that it felt like he was talking down to us. I said to my peers multiple times throughout the semester that Dr. Sucosky is probably one of the most well-spoken professors I've ever had. The handouts he procured and gave us for some of the lectures were one of the most helpful things I've had in a class to date, and I'll probably end up missing them in future classes. :: Dr. Sucosky would answer and explain any question and would challenge the students in the class. He was respectful of the students. :: more examples would probably help in understanding the material in this class. to not disrupt how you currently teach the class maybe have the class three days a week and the third class is a recap and then go over the previous weeks homework and then run through a few harder examples. I'm a visual learner so being able to see multiple examples helps. you could use your home works from years past as the examples. :: Explanations were very clear. Great at breaking down complicated examples. :: Dr. Sucosky is very organized and easy to follow. I love the way he teaches his class. He is always available for questions and encourages class participation. :: He always had handouts for class to help cover more material faster, and it provides easy to follow examples and explanation for the material. He always worked to answer all questions and tried to get the class to think about the material instead of just telling us info and expecting it to be absorbed. He respected everyone in the class too. :: Explanations and examples were very clear, most everything was well defined. :: The handouts were great for class notes. In the handouts, the process for answering some of the problems was broken down step-by-step.  If you really pay attention to the class notes and spend a decent amount of time on the homework, you can do fairly well on the exams. For the first few days, people complained about writing the homework in pen. I think it helps if you begin your homework in pencil similar to a draft and write the final copy in pen. Writing the problems multiple times could help with the retention of material. The exams were bearable because notes were allowed to be used. One of the biggest problems I noticed was math (derivation and integration) errors being made. The math errors seemed to set people back in this course. The comments on the first page of the exam are a really great tool to utilize to learn form your mistakes. :: I love how Sucosky teaches his class. His class is super organized with his notes and handouts. The class is quite challenging and requires you to really think, however, Sucosky explains the material very well and everything you need to know is right in the notes. :: Little hard to understand and goes pretty fast, just works out the theory and reasoning of problems. Would be great if he worked out actual problems in class.  Still a good teacher. :: Professor Sucosky is one of the best professors I have come across in the ME department. He is very organized with his lectures so it is easy to stay on track and focus on the material. His lectures include many detailed derivations and examples with connections with the real world. This teaching strategy aided my learning greatly. :: Dr. Sucosky, does great job of explaining material to students. He takes the time to provide handouts over each section of material.  I am a big fan of these handouts.  I would print these handouts before class and take notes on them. This really help me learn the material during class lecture and help me stay organized with my notes. :: Fluid is a very difficult class and coming into this class i was determined to pass the class. but i didn't know what was going on and i got lost in the class. I'm struggling to get a C in the class which will be my first C ever in college. If more detailed explanations could be given regarding exams and information provided are detailed oriented, i feel like people will do better.the purpose of homework is to help you prepare for an exam. Giving difficult homework that are not in the textbook and unable to solve doesn't encourage you to learn the materials. I suggest homework should be related to exams. :: Class was very well structured. Handouts for notes really helped for reference. :: The instructor did an excellent job explaining the concepts of fluid dynamics, proofs and core equations, any examples provided, the answers to any questions asked. The homework stimulated my thinking because of their difficulty, but, for the most part, I was able to solve them. He respected individuals and their differences. :: I think most students would agree the 1st test is brutal but I dont think its because your did a bad job covering the material its just that we are all used to how other profs structure exams and homeworks. We are used to applying known equations with given variables to fit certain engineering principles but you make us derive everything and it definitely through me for a loop so I was not prepared to do this for an exam. :: very good and very informative. :: professor makes thorough handouts with examples that make it significantly easier to understand the material. :: The classes were streamlined with handouts that aided in the ability to follow along with the instruction of concepts. Philippe provided plenty examples and guides for solving problems that also aided in the ability to work through homework and exam problems. Sucosky provided real world examples of the concepts via videos and images that helped to visualize these concepts and stimulate thinking. :: Explanations and examples were always on point. He's very knowledgeable and does a great job explaining the material.. Material is very challenging but I think he does a great job explaining the basic concepts in a way that can be applied on more difficult problems"
53,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5350,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- The instructor's handouts are very helpful for understanding and future reference. :: Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of the subject with multiple examples per section of the class as well as relating it to his field to get a real world understanding of how to topics and equations work. :: Really appreciate the exam reviews and allowing open notes. Confused on why we are not given the full lecture time to complete exams. Practice exams also much appreciated. :: The class is paced, planned, and executed excellently in this class. The class is not a joke and definitely not easy, but with the structure of this semester it was an enjoyable learning environment that I haven't experienced in a long time. :: Yes, the handouts helped tremendously. :: Yes, handouts. :: Yes. He made had everything very well organized in a way that made following the class a lot easier. :: My understanding of all the material covered the course was enhanced. :: Dr. Sucosky was extremely helpful. Whenever we had a question about anything we could ask him with full confidence we would not only have an answer to the question, but a deeper understanding of why the answer was what it was. :: The instructor would answer questions in class, after class, or in his office ours. :: Provided handouts to cover complicated examples. :: Yes, he was always available during his office hours and after class to assist students who have questions. :: Yes he did. With his handouts, homework, and old exams; I was able to learn the material and develop an understanding of what was actually covered, instead of just learning the material enough to take the test and pass. :: Absolutely, the structure and organization of the course content was incredibly helpful. :: I downloaded some of the suggested apps and programs which helped me visualize fluid flow around solid objects. Coming into this class, I knew a little information of Bernoulli's equation and fluid flow. I enjoyed going more in depth with the topics of the class this semester. It definitely broadened my knowledge of fluid dynamics. :: Yes. As I said before, professor Sucosky is a very good lecturer. His lectures are interactive and full of detailed examples. He always stops for questions if some students get confused. :: He provides handouts over each section and does recap when wrapping up each section of material. This helps you hear and see materials before moving onto new material. :: No, like i said i didnt learn anything and failed my exams. I get so lost in the class that i barely know what he is talking about. :: When I came in for office hours and had a question regarding anything, Dr. Sucosky was always able to answer my question. Even questions that were further than the scope of the class were answered from time to time. :: Yes, the instructor explained every concept very clearly and to the point. His explanations of the NS equations, control volume analysis, and pressure distribution across a body were excellent. I struggled on the dimensional analysis portion to some degree, but I believe that has to do with the topic more than the instructor. The homeworks and the homework solutions do an excellent job clarifying any vague or uncertain part about the core concepts. :: Yes because he made us derive so much stuff that if you wanted to pass you were forced you to understand it mathematically. Plus it helped refresh some math I hadn't used in a while. :: yes the lectures were very informative and the handouts were a big help in understanding the material. :: Instructor is always available for office hours. :: Sucosky was available for consultation during his office hours where he was able to help work through a specific problem using the correct methodology. :: I asked a LOT of questions! He was always happy to answer them. I didn't visit during office hours due to my schedule but I would frequently ask questions after class. He was very nice and very patient  I would definitely take another course with this professor."
54,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5350,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Having notes for the exams was very helpful to see all the examples of how to do the problems as there are lots of equations and assumptions to memorize for each exam so that was very generous. :: N/a. :: Learned a lot from this class. :: Dr. Sucosky is asked to teach a very important class. It is probably one of the most difficult classes I have taken so far but with him teaching it, I was able to do well in the class. :: People are hard on Dr. Sucosky. His style may not work for people, but as long as you put effort into the subject, get help, and review all the material before the exams; you can do fine. He covers all the material you could need and is always open to questions. He truly cares about the student's understanding of the subject. The homework assignments can be hard, but he does this on purpose to prepare you. Also, he is great on partial credit. If you mess up one little detail or calculation, he doesn't take off a large amount of points. It's different if you miss the main part of the problem, but he is still fair on grading. :: I had heard that fluid dynamics was very difficult and it was nearly impossible to receive a good grade in the course. However, professor Sucosky teaches in a way that is very easy to connect with. He gives many examples and also practice exams for students to compare their work with. While the exams were challenging, I always felt that I knew what was expected of me ging into the exam. This helped me study the concepts effectively and succeed on the exams. :: He knows the material but he has to consider that few students do not have english has their first language. He needs to break down equations to a lay man's level. :: Dr. Sucosky is an excellent professor. His class is straightforward and clear. The homeworks test each student's abilities, and, after the solutions are posted, any confusing aspects about the concepts or math can be addressed and corrected. :: Your homeworks were hard mission accomplished.. But it did help me better understand the material so I thank you for that. I do have a small suggestion tho, maybe add some more of those very basic simple ones to the harder more involved ones because I found myself searching for easier problems to do just to get the basic principles down to do your harder ones. :: i think the open note tests are very good and feel they should be kept. :: Mr. Sucosky is a really good instructor. I enjoyed the course a lot. I did feel really overwhelmed with the homework assignments. They were really really difficult and time consuming, I would like to have maybe more problems that weren't as difficult to have more practice. If I missed a problem my homework grade went down considerably even with partial credit.  Exams were very fair, and if you studied notes and homework solutions they were perfectly reasonable. Really no excuse to have a bad grade considering they were tests with open notes. Organizing notes helps a lot before the test.  Overall, he's very knowledgeable and demonstrates passion, and understanding for the subject which made me want to learn more about it. This was my favorite class and I enjoyed the learning process. I was a little scared at the beginning of the course because I had heard about how difficult the material is, but I felt more confident after the first test."
55,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5350,Question 14,"Additional comments--- The structure of the class and the process for handling homework and exams was very helpful and amazing. :: This class was an enjoyable learning experience where I was able to learn and maintain the skills taught to me. I don't say it very often but I did actually enjoy this course. The 1 hour 20 mins does seem to drag on forever though. :: N/a. :: I believe Sucosky is the best professor to teach this class. :: One of my favorite professors. :: Really liked the handouts and added examples that were provided for the course. Strongly encourage keeping the class setup the same as a whole. :: Dr. Sucosky, I saw you are teaching Thermodynamics 1 in the fall. I would recommend that you change a few things from your Fluids class to the thermodynamics class. I would recommend that you use the book and use homework problems out of the book. I don't think the students in Thermodynamics 1 could handle the way your class is ran right now with the harder homework problems and using handouts deriving equations. I would do a lot of numerical example problems in class from the chapter problems in the book.  The professors I've had for Thermodynamics 1 and 2 have both used the book and the problems in the book. I would also change the way the grades are distributed and have the homework worth less and the exams a little more and use quizzes or a project to make up the difference in points. :: This is my second time taking Fluid Dynamics. I felt the open note exams were much easier and conductive to learning compared to the closed note exams given last fall. :: I love the set up of the class. Please do not change this! I loved being able to have notes on exams even though I hardly used them. The homework was a little difficult but they weren't impossible. I felt well prepared for all homework and exams. :: Although the material of this course can be difficult, I found the class to be very interesting and not as difficult as I assumed it to be. This was definitely one of the best courses I taken this semester. :: Can Sucosky teach all of my classes?. :: Dr. Sucosky, is a very good professor.  I would take him again for another class. Fluids is a hard class but he is able to communicated and explain material for students to learn.  I wish he taught my other classes this semester.   Thank you Dr. Sucosky, ME 3350 is one of my favorite classes!. :: He's a good professor and knows the material , but relaying the materials to student is the only issue. :: The current setup for exams works very well. I rarely needed to reference them, but when I needed to it was nice to have them. :: I do like your handouts and material from your website. It really was nice to have to study for the midterms. :: Instructor was one of the best teachers I have had. I really appreciate the large amount of resources he provided including many practice exams, homework problems that were challenging and related to concepts seen on future tests, and well thought out handouts for each chapter. :: Difficult material. Great instructor! Fair grading and tests"

66,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5360,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- The professor did a great job of presenting the class information in an organized manner. He provided a decent amount of examples, even though I would recommend more examples for the heat conduction sections since there seemed to be fewer examples for the first exam. He was respectful to students and asked stimulating questions during class to help us understand the material. He was open to questions in and out of class. :: Good. :: Worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life by far. Very unclear, very rude and prideful, class time was not far from useless, and he has no respect for his students or other people. :: Philippe Sucosky is my favorite teacher I've had in my college career. I could tell he did everything in his power to help his students pass and be successful in his class. He always used all of class time wisely. He always well defined what we needed to know for quizzes and tests and then even taught us more so we would be better prepared for later in life. I wish i had Philippe Sucosky for all my classes! He is the epitomy of teaching and i wish Wright State University would higher more teacher like him and of his quality. He spent more time invested in his class and had more knowledge of the subject than any teacher i know! Some students complain about him because they are lazy and want to pass the class with doing absolutely nothing and putting forth no effort. Any student that complained about him probably did not attend the majority of his classes and they get upset because they ridiculously think it is their right to pass. Philippe Sucosky has been the most fair teacher i have ever had in my 5 years of college. Many could tell that he really did everything in his power for his students to be successful and pass. Honestly, he was too easy. He required a very fair amount of effort from his students. He was always very willing to answer questions and explained them very well. Most students that complained about him (especially one) chose never to come to class and not even to show up to an exam, when i know for a fact that they could've been their for it but the person was trying to get away with extra days to study because he procrastinated. That's not fair to the other students, or to the teacher. Even after this student trying to be tricky and sneaky, Philippe Sucosky was very nice, respectful, and fair to the student, doing everything in his power to help the student out after the student made a very poor decision. Philippe Sucocky deserves praise and a raise and more teacher should the effort like he does into his students and classes. :: The professor formulates the course around his handouts and his notes and it works really well. Its easy to follow along with the course and catch up if you get behind. The homework is similar to the exam problems and are graded very fairly. :: Sucosky did a great job in aiding in my understanding of the material. His notes were thorough and well laid out. His lectures were structured and he never wasted a moment on non-relevant information. He was respectful of all students and expected a lot. He handled questions well and was always able to clarify. :: Sucosky is very detailed. Provides good notes and examples for the students to follow. Overall clear and concise with his lectures. All of these are why I chose him as a prof. :: Class was very well organized. Every class he reviewed what happened last class and then moved on it lecture."
67,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5360,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes, he aided in my understanding of the subject. He provided organized lectures and defined any confusing concepts. His layout of chapters and topics were easy to follow and helpful. :: Good. :: No. I learned absolutely nothing in this class. Philip is just straight out a bad teacher. I strongly feel this way, and I know other students do as well. :: Tremendously!!! He was the only reason I understood anything at all!! Some teachers make you learn the material by yourself, but not Philippe Sucosky, he spent every moment in class personally explaining every single topic and problem using his profound and plethora of knowledge and understanding. Always willing to answer any question a student had in as much depth as it was needed. :: Heat transfer by nature is a difficult subject and Professor Sucosky makes it much simpler to understand. :: Absolutely. The combination of structured notes and challenging homework was extremely helpful in the learning process. :: Yes, through detailed examples and handouts, the difficult content was made much more clear. He always made sure to understand questions and answer them as clearly as possible. :: yes"
68,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5360,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- The class was laid out in an organized manner. I would suggest more examples on heat conduction and defining what topics are expected to be on each exam. The topics don't have to be specific, but a general overview for students to follow. I believe that both additions would aid students in understanding the material more easily. I also don't know how much I prefer the open note exams to the closed note exams that were used in previous classes. This may be another aspect of the class you might want to consider changing based on class results. Overall, it was a challenging semester. :: He did amazing in every single area of his class! I look forward to having more classes with him!!!. :: ,"
69,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Spring,ME 5360,Question 14,"Additional comments--- I was challenged in this class throughout the entire semester, however I did learn a lot through the organized teaching style. :: Exams was harder since it was an open book exam, which is unfair. Furthermore, the time of the exam was too short we barely had time to do the questions. We need more time to do the exam. :: Ive had previous professors who were actually good teachers and actually taught the students. This professor does not teach, and you do not want to learn from him. He has no interest in his students and does not care if they pass or fail. He has said multiple times during class to ""Not waist my time"". He has discouraged students coming to his office with questions and asking about the material. This review is only partial to my dislike of this class. I have never come across a student who has said they liked him. I'm disappointed in Wright State for hiring such a professor. Very disappointed. Please wright state, take more care in hiring teachers for students. Would even consider switching colleges because of the sense of the lack of care of what teachers this college hires. :: Some people are going to give Philippe Sucosky a bad rap and report. That is because those people are bad students and/or bad people and/or misunderstood him. I don't think they liked his french accent and the mood he set. i think they didn't understand the personality he had. But anyone could tell that he put a ton of effort into helping his students pass his class and i am very thankful for him as a teacher. Thank you Philippe Sucosky! Have a good summer!. :: One of my favorite professors in college. I wish he taught more classes. :: ,. :: It always felt like I was trying to learn one material and being tested on another. Not sure what I was supposed to get out of this class, but I didn't get it."

She spent class time well with good notes and examples to teach the subject. :: The explanations were very clear and she gave plenty of examples. The course was made as interesting as it could be and everyone was respected. :: Other than homework there was  no real preparation for exams, she has finally provided a practice exam for the final. I would like to have clearer instruction on what will be provided on the exams. Material was also correlated directly from notes which were often incorrect. :: Dr. Gockel was very clear with all of her lessons and related much of the course material to real life examples. She was able to answer all the students questions and graded very fairly. :: This class was good. She respected everyone. The questions were handled well. :: The simplicity yet effectiveness of her teaching makes it really easy to understand what she is teaching. She handles questions wells and is willing to stop class to answer important questions. :: She handled questions very well, would have liked more examples during lecture. :: Overall, a few more examples shown in class would be helpful. :: Instructor explained information well and expanded when asked questions. My notes were a little unorganized with the way she worked through the derivations of equations. I would prefer it if she explicitly wrote down the equation, then worked through the derivation of it. I think it would make it easier to go back later and find it in the notes. :: I don't have much to say, there was a good mix of examples and walk through of the theory.

Concept quizzes were helpful in remembering and understanding the underlying concepts. :: Yes.

She is very receptive to questions and thoroughly answers them. She often uses visual aids, such as breaking chalk or paperclips, to help students understand. :: The instructor did a good job of giving examples and providing a good understanding of material in class. She showed students how to use graphs and where to find them. However, sometimes the homework she assigned would require different equations that she did not go over in class.  She was respectful inside and outside of class. :: All portions were good. :: Instructor did a very good job of explaining course material. :: very clear teaching style and good examples to learn new material. Test had way too much content on them for myself. I was only able to fully finish one exam. :: Good teacher I enjoyed this class. :: Clarity of examples fell short of expectations from time to time, but overall an effective learning environment. :: Not much to complain about in this class honestly. Some of the examples done in lectures felt rushed and I didn't have much time to actually pay attention to what Dr. Gockel was actually saying. :: Some examples were not very clear and we were rushed a lot of the time. The 55 minute class seemed to short because we could do few examples and they couldnt be very long. :: Did a pretty good job of explaining material and information that was presented in an organized fashion. :: 4/5. Joy did a good job when it came to teaching. The one thing she lacked mostly on was clarity. Occasionally she would write down equations that were not used or the same as the textbook, it turns out some of these equations were minor typos. Quizzes were a very good use as they helped students continuously think about the material. :: Everything about Dr. Gockel's teaching strategy is excellent. I do wish however some students didn't continually interrupt her, but even then she answers questions quickly and gets back into the teaching. :: Joy is (for lack of a better term) a joy in class.  She somehow keeps this energy about her that makes the material engaging and is very responsive to questions from the students.  Problems are worked out on the board and make sense.  Homework feels like it's on-par with what was taught in class. :: I thought the instructor was clear and she had good in class examples. She respected all of the individuals that were in the class and seemed to get her point across for the information that was given. :: I enjoyed the teaching style, there was a good mix of theory and example problems done in class. :: Very effective instructor. Examples and real-world applications were clear and helpful to understanding. :: . :: Joy was a great professor.  She did a lot of examples and taught well within the class time. :: Joy is clear and explains things well. The math is worked out before class and so sometimes there is more writing then learning in class. :: She was very clear on questions and examples. :: examples in class were very simple then homework was very challenging since we did not have proper examples to look back on. :: Dr. Gockel was generally a good professor. She had well-outlined notes and organized lectures, and seems to want people to succeed. :: Very clear examples and thorough answering of questions from students. :: Teacher did a very good job of laying out the material and explaining it in terms that were easily understood, homework aided in the learning of the material as well. However, the exams were absolutely brutal and there was way too much material put on the exam for the time allotted to take it. :: Examples and notes were good. It would've been nice to see more complicated situations to reference while studying for exams. :: Dr. Gockel is an excellent professor. She explains everything thoroughly and ensures that everybody understands the subject. :: Dr. Gockel was an excellent teacher. She knows the material well and explains it to the students in a simplified way so they can grasp the content. :: Very clear, well done. :: Very clear explanations during example problems. Usually had an answer to a question on the spot. :: Dr. Gockel is very knowledgeable and helped me better understand this subject greatly. :: Dr. Gockel did a great job at teaching this course.  Lots of examples and explanations.  I like that she supplies sample tests before each midterm to help me focus my study.  I would have liked her to provide the solutions for the sample exam for the final. :: Good professor. Examples weren't always clear. Tests were too long for students that don't work fast. :: Dr. Gockel is kind and friendly. She is easily approachable. Her topics are clear and she teaches them well. She uses good examples that allowed me to understand the topics better."

Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- See above. :: Yes the professor aided my understanding of the subject. She was available during office hours and she responded to emails. She answered any questions that I asked during class. :: Yes. Real life examples were discussed during the course that helped the importance and understanding of the material. :: yes, very good at teaching this subject. I learned the content and understood it but struggled on the test. :: Yes. Good in class examples. Ties to real life examples discussed. :: Yes, understand on types of loading and stresses has been greatly improved. :: Dr. Gockel gave good real life examples from when she worked in the field. :: yes, real world applications on the subject and detail explanations of concepts. :: To a degree yes, most of the understanding just came from the problems assigned as homework. She did do well with realistic applications of the material to aid in understanding. :: yes. :: Yes. :: She is prepared to fix the class's weaknesses by bringing back old problems multiple times to ensure we get enough exposure to fix the issue. :: Yeah she did. There was one time where she brought in a paper clip and we broke it in fatigue and compared how many cycles it took for us to break the paper clip. It was interesting. :: Yes. Examples and real-world applications were clear and helpful to understanding. :: . :: Yes.  She made sure to answer everyones questions, even when some people asked WAY too many. :: yes, she worked out many examples and answered questions. :: Yes she would always fully explain things and give you an answer so you understand it. :: yes. :: She was available during office hours when I went to visit, and she always answered students' questions. :: Yes. Many of the examples performed in class gave a very clear idea of the material being studied. :: yes. :: I mean she taught the class. :: Yes. She gave plenty of helpful examples in class, and was very clear in her explanations. :: Yes, as stated before she was clear and concise with her lectures and example problems. She didn't just tell us t do something, she explained why we had to do it which always helps with understanding. :: Yes. Gave lots of examples and described everything in a way that was easy to understand. :: Met with students after class and answered all questions to help students understand. :: Yes. :: Yes, she was very detailed in her teaching methods.  She is also very knowledgeable about the course material. :: Somewhat. :: Dr. Gockel did aid in my understanding of this subject. She worked through multiple examples for each topic, this allowed me to better understand the topics."
96,Joy Gockel,2018 Spring,ME 4140,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- The professor did a good job of explaining material in class and being available for questions. However, the exams were too long for the time that was given. I believe that the time crunch on the exams caused some students to not have the ability to perform to their full potential. Furthermore, the exams varied quite a bit from the homework and practice exams given. I do not think that the provided study material represented what was to be expected on each exam. :: No matter how much I studied, there was never enough time to finish the exams. Therefor, I had to rush and provided inferior work or couldn't complete a large portion of the exam. This negatively affected my grade when I sufficiently knew the information on the exam, but didn't have enough time to complete the problems. :: sometimes concepts in class were not covered in a lot of detailed, but i went to office hours so it was no big deal. :: no comment. :: Joy is a pretty cool cat. :: . :: Joy was very available and fair when it came to grading. :: None. :: -. :: na. :: N/a. :: decent"
97,Joy Gockel,2018 Spring,ME 4140,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Overall, the teacher did well at explaining material for the class. She should definitely consider the length of exams. :: The tests of the course were too long for a 55 minute class. Many other students felt the same way. I feel like the tests were timed perfectly for 1 hour and 20 minute courses. This happened with all the tests not any specific one.  Another point would be when we got the design project. I feel like it would be a better course if we were able to work on the design project throughout the course instead of the last month.  In the last month of classes all classes give projects and papers due at the same time before finals. It really does not make sense to me that this happens. If we got the project at the on the second or third week of classes we could apply each subject we learned throughout the semester. If this was possible maybe a list of potential project subjects could be made too so that students would be sure to get a good subject that would apply to most of the class.  Otherwise the course was well taught. Class time was well spent and followed well. The connections between class, examples, homework, and tests was made. If the tests were shorter the class would be much better. :: Exams for this class were too long for the amount of time given. Having one of the exams dropped helps make up for this problem. :: The design project was vague considering it was a significant portion of our grade. Could have been provided with a better understanding of what was expected for the project by providing examples old projects or more in-depth requirements for the project. :: Make exams more reasonable to the 55 minute time frame. I personally had issues getting all the exams done without feeling rushed. Also slow down on some of the classroom material. It was difficult to grasp some of the concepts at the rate she was moving on some days. :: All I would say to improve on the class lecture is to focus more-so on quality as opposed to quantity of material, as some of the lectures seemed very rushed. :: Tests are to long for a 55 minutes class. Some material seems unorganized. I wish things would have lined up with the book better. It made it harder to know what exactly to study for exams. :: available outside of office hours which was great. nice and fair. :: Exams need work. Keep the difficulty the same or maybe make them a tad harder but they definitely need to be tailored to the amount of time we have to take them in class (a 55 minute class period should be given an exam that a STUDENT should be able to accomplish in 55 minutes). :: Awesome professor, professional, knowledgeable, and fair. Tests were a little tough though. Just not enough time. :: The project at the very end of class felt a little sudden.  Perhaps informing the students a week or two sooner to form groups and pick a topic would let them better research their project for a more well-constructed paper. :: Overall I thought the exams were reflected about what we have learned. However, they were a little long and at times were very difficult to finish on time. Cutting off one part of one problem may help, maybe two. Just advice and you can leave it or take it. :: I felt that there was not enough time to complete the exams. Three problems that you have to work through extensively in 55 min does not leave room to think about what you need to do and if you get stuck you will not finish in time. :: . :: Great class, the only thing that I felt overwhelmed by are the exams. Unless you started the problems off correctly there was no way of going back and making corrections while finishing the exam. This is defiantly due to the class only being 50 min. long. :: Exams were extremely difficult to complete in the given time. :: Dr. Gockel's class was pretty enjoyable. My BIG critique: Exams 1 and 2 were too long for a 55 minute time block! I felt much more intimidated by the time restrictions than the difficulty of the material itself. Pop quizzes are a pain, but I feel they help keep you in check and ensure that you are leaning the material at a good pace. So I guess they serve their purpose. Overall, not bad, but please please please think about the length of the exams, because I feel that a number of other students share these feelings. :: I think most students can agree that the exams given in the class were 1 hour and 20 minute exams, not 55 minute exams. :: Keep up the good work! :). :: na. :: The only downside was that no lecture notes were posted if a student did not copy something down in time. :: Exam questions were fair in difficulty, as in no curveballs, but there was consistently too much content for a 55 min exam. If given more time I would have been able to get an A on all of the exams as Dr. Gockel prepared us accordingly, but there wasnât enough time to finish the exams for me. :: decent. :: I would like to thank Dr. Gockel for a great semester."

108,Zifeng Yang,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Classes where unorganized and hard to follow. It was difficult to tell what was the important information of the course. Explanations and examples where usually sloppy and not prepared well. Questions were handed decently. Everything else was fine. :: Teaching was a little unclear and examples were explained too fast. :: Lectures were unclear and vague. Clear disconnect between notes and book, due to a new book being used. The information expected to be learned was not sufficiently taught in or class or available in the book. Lab was very poorly organized. Professor often spent up to 30 minutes of lab dealing with technical difficulties and there was often obvious lack of preparation for the lab. Time was wasted at the beginning of the lab setting up portions of the lab that students should be familiar with, while the end of the lab containing new information was rushed through and students were often left with only left with 15 minutes to complete the portion of the lab required for the lab report. Sufficient information to complete the lab reports and post-lab questions was not learned in the lab. Actual lab was not consistent with provided lab manual, specifically in regards to equipment used. This lab would greatly benefit from a couple TAs. :: His lectures were well organized. We knew what we were doing and what was going to be like. He did mess up a lot, tried to correct himself but sometimes it was unclear what the correct thing is. :: Had issues understanding some material due to complexity of the material, but overall good at explaining methods and examples. :: Dr. Yang seemed to be very scatter-brained when lecturing for this course. He informed us that he has not taught this class in a couple years, back when it called for a different text book so the difference in notes between what was taught in lecture and what was seen in the homework was confusing. :: All teaching aspects were good, only downside is that sometimes the writing was hard to read, but its on me for not saying anything about it. The layout of the room didn't help either. :: Prof. Yang was very thorough in explaining and providing examples for the material. The material itself just isn't interesting and isn't easy concepts. :: The class was a little unorganized sometimes. we did examples but they rarely helped with doing homework problems, however they did help with exams, sometimes explanations of things wasnt always the best, but overall if was fine. :: Dr. Yang had good examples most of the time. Sometimes he got mixed around in his examples and wouldn't be able to finish the problem. :: Did a very good job at teaching. Very and clear and willing to answer any questions the students may have. :: The lectures were okay for the most part. The notes can be a little more clear. He kind of goes back and forth on the board when presenting material in class. :: Clarity was a bit of a problem in this class. He doesnât use the same variables in the class that the book uses which is extremely confusing. He also didnât explain how to do the formal lab report until AFTER it was due which isnât helpful. He also didnât clarify in the syllabus that quizzes would be bonus and that all quizzes and lab reports were done as a group so some of us had aleady started the report by ourselves before we realized itâs a group report. :: Perhaps it is just the class material itself, but the subjects we covered were a seemingly random assortment of topics. I almost feel like there should be classes taken before EMI because I had not been exposed to a vast majority of the material. Also, the class was super fast paced and barely covered each of the topics. :: I don't really feel like I learned a lot from the lectures. Sometimes the lectures were informative but most of the time examples were hard to follow and included many mistakes. :: Dr. Yang is very knowledgeable and helped me out a lot on the things I had questions about. :: He wasn't very clear during lab. He basically made us follow  his instructions not providing much information what the actual steps were for. Did not help us understand the overall goal of the experiment very well. :: His course was very scattered. He is hard to understand. He sometimes answered questions that people didn't ask and wouldn't try to answer the correct question."
109,Zifeng Yang,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Although the instructor did go through the book, explain it, and go over examples, there was not a lot of organization or thought put into it. Going over the material is not enough when teaching the class. I often left the classroom confused and frustrated without understanding what was covered. :: not really. I had to do a lot of self learning. :: No. Information from lecture rarely helps with homework or exam content. Notes posted on Pilot are even more vague than lecture notes. Book is next to useless. Often didn't define keywords or explain key concepts discussed in class, sometimes didn't even include main topics discussed in class. Definitely not sufficient to aid in understanding of theoretical concepts used in lab. :: Yes. He tried explaining everything as well as he could. Would give good examples after teaching theory. :: Yes, my understanding of how statistics is applied to engineering was greatly improved. :: Yes, answered questions after class to help with understanding of the subject. :: Yes, provided in class examples often and had pop quiz's that he provided the solution to upon completion. :: kind of, wouldnt hurt to do more examples. Talk more on the correlation of the labs with the class. :: yes, Dr. Yang would go through different examples that covered the different scenarios in class. :: Yang was extremely helpful in me completing my lab assignments. Even if I screwed up multiple times to get correct lab data (which I did), he was very responsive and polite in helping me set up the lab again in order to get it right.  He was very quick to respond to emails and tell me when I could come to his office for this, and it felt very easy to do so.   Thank you. :: Yes the instructor aided in my understand of the subject. Often I would ask questions during the lectures, Zifeng always answered my questions clearly and in a way that made sense to me. :: Yes, If I had a question, he answered it to the best of his ability. He replied to emails in a timely manner as well. :: Not really. I knew the early stuff because of a previous statistics class but if I hadnât had that class I donât think I wouldâve done near as well on the first exam. Class lectures also donât tend to correspond to homework problems. Notes are usually all over the place and not very organized. :: Somewhat. :: Yes. :: Not so much. :: There were parts of the course during which he wrote three equations that should have had the same indices of a summation, but all three equations had three different indices. One was 0 to N, one was 1 to N, and the last was 0 to N-1. I still have no idea which one is correct."
110,Zifeng Yang,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- This class is not well taught nor is there sufficient information in supplemental information posted by professor or within the textbook. Many topics were covered very briefly, not allowing to learn topics as in depth as expected. The only time I had success in this class was when the homework or exam problems happened to be very similar to one of the few examples from class or a book problem unlike content learned in class. :: His hand writing on the board was sometimes hard to see or follow. Would cram words close together or jump from one part of the board to another then back. :: Prof. Yang was a great instructor, a few of the lab assignments seemed to even stump him at times though. :: I felt kind of lost, just wasn't sure what was going on sometimes or why we were going over it. the labs were kind of rough. it wouldnt hurt to give a more detailed or do examples for exam reveiw. :: Dr. Yang is knowable on this subject and has good real life examples that make this class easier to learn with. I feel he was thrown in this class last minute and didn't have enough time to prepare for it correctly which could be why lecture and lab had some rough spots where the examples wouldn't work out correctly or he had trouble figuring out a lab or 2. :: Zifeng is a pretty cool dude. :: Great teacher. :: Lab time was not handled very well. The instructor seemed confused a lot of the time and didnât seem well prepared when he would walk us through what to do. Also he spent a lot of time on really easy parts and went really fast through parts that were confusing. :: N/a. :: This class was boring and scattered but I think I learned something in it."
111,Zifeng Yang,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 14,"Additional comments--- The course needs to be better organized. It should easy to use the notes and book do the homework. Sometimes things referenced in the classroom were not the same as what was in the book. This made the course confusing. I part of the problem is the book is not written very well and is hard to understand. :: The textbook for this class was truly terrible. Rarely contained descriptions information of topics discussed in class and often equations and other information were presented very differently than in class. :: Not at this time. :: Course textbook is absolutely horrendous. It does more bad than good, the concepts were confusing and no clarity is given. And there needs to be a better way to introduce labVIEW to the students either prior to the course or during. Having one orientation in the class then being expected to use the software for all of the lab assignments isn't very practical. :: Dont think we should be required to stay in the same group for the entirety of the class, maybe different groups each week. Nice professor and moderately fair. usually available outside of office hours. extra credit quizzes were great idea. :: WHY DOES THIS CLASS HAVE TO BE SO EARLY. :: The only recommendation I have is that the labs be done slower. Often, labs would be done at a quick pace and it would be hard to follow along and understand what was happening. :: N/a. :: The book for this class is terrible. It should not be used. The school should find a new book to use for this class. The book should actually be able to be used as a resource for the class."

Sheng Li was respectful of students and stimulated our thinking. :: Although a bit dry at times, Professor Li is clearly a very capable teacher of his subject. This is apparent by his highly in-depth explanations of topics, but also in the way that he required the class to think about problems; answers were not simply spoon-fed to students, which greatly stimulated the learning in his classroom. :: I feel like he tried to make sure that everyone understood the examples and problems in class. :: Dr. Li was very effective in his lecture and use of time. :: Great teacher. Examples were laid out and explained fairly well. Asked good questions and lectured at a good pace. :: Teacher presented multiple examples of each subject and answered any questions the students had, stopping to make sure he provided opportunities for students ask. :: Clear explanations, handled questions well, stimulated lots of thinking, and very respectful. :: He was very good at giving us practice problems before the exams. :: The professor did a really good job of making sure that people understood the material. :: I loved all the examples he showed, he just moved through some of them too fast. :: Overall, I thought Sheng Li gave more than enough examples during class as well as answered questions clearly. He had a strong respect for individuals and their differences. :: N/a. :: Could go a bit slower in class so people can catch up on their notes. :: Good teacher who often challenged students to think. Examples were very detailed and helpful. :: He did a good job of teaching the topics and going through examples. He did not always show us how to finish a problem because he just assumed we knew how to do it from where he stopped. :: Great instructor, always makes sure we know that we should ask questions no matter how bad. :: Great Professor, 8.9/10 STIMULATION OF THINKING: The only dissatisfaction I had, was that he would ask vague questions to guide the students, rather than specific questions; and in the first 6 weeks, he would wait an unnecessary long time for the students to volunteer an answer--which they refused to do.  I found that by personally guessing the questions incorrectly, either he would move on and explain more quickly, or another student would be emboldened by my foolishness, to volunteer an answer of their own. But in all other respects a great professor."

His lecture notes were very clear and helpful. :: Yes. Taught concisely and clearly. :: Yes with thorough explanations of varied examples. :: Yes. We always learned about a new topic and were given multiple examples. This is a great style of teaching for students to really understand the material in this type of class. :: Yes, he was very knowledgeable of his teachings. :: He would ask questions throughout the class as he is going over the examples and would clarify any questions that were asked. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. He gave more than enough examples for each topic covered in class that day as well as special tips/tricks that could be used to solve the problems. He also gave old exam questions on previous exams as examples for exam reviews for upcoming exams. :: N/a. :: Yes, helped me after class a few times. :: Yes, he would break down problems if they did not seem clear. :: Yes, his style of teaching is what I like to have so it made learning the topics much easier. :: Yes. Sheng Li has a very solid set of skill in teaching. :: He was an instructor and he instructed well.  Patient too. When someone had a question about something he just explained, he did not [rehash the entire example and ignore the question]*, but actively sought to answer the student. *Re-hashing is common among tenured professors and just wastes time."

For my own studying style, I would appreciate examples that are not explained in the book (perhaps other book problems not assigned as homework). Additionally, I have previously taken Biomechanics 1, which is the BME equivalent of Statics. I was pleasantly surprised when we covered more material in this class and explored topics in more depth. :: No. :: N/a. :: Nothing. :: Not much to say.  Most profs I've had have been worse.

Even if they're really dumb. lol. :: He did a lot of example problems to show different situations. :: He did a bunch of examples, he made sure to cover everything, and do a large amount of examples. :: Very clear explanations, answered questions thoroughly and gave plenty of good examples to supplement. :: Sheng Li is an amazing professor and among the best professors in the engineering department. His examples are crystal clear and mimic exactly what we need to know for the exam. He is one of the few classes I've taken in college where I can simply review the notes and I feel confident to answer homework problems and exam problems. He answers all questions no matter how basic the question is. He is passionate at encouraging students to think of solutions on their own with a bit of guidance. He is respectful and well prepared. :: He was effective at doing what he was supposed to do. :: Overall he was very effective at communication.  He definitely knows the subject well enough to easily handle questions in class, but not in such a way that he left his class confused about what was happening.  We could see what the approach was and have it make sense as to why he was doing it."

He breaks down difficult problems into more basic parts and makes seemingly impossible problems easy. The times where I have asked him questions he gives a very full answer. Most professors seem to be in a rush to give a quick answer which only leaves you more confused.

He is a fantastic  professor and excellent at his job. :: Keep up the good work. :: Mainly my quibble with this class is homework.  The homework was a frustration for me, because I feel that the lecture didn't adequately prepare me for the homework problems.  I could feel confident in lecture but be lost on the homework.  Dr. Li himself admitted that the homework problems were harder than what was being covered in class.  Additionally only one homework problem from each assignment was graded due to the grader's limited availability.  This made the homework frustrating for me to do."

This class is a very practical class, but he treated it in a theoretical/conceptual way. :: He taught material much harder than was asked for on the exams. I lost interest in his lectures because they were way too complex. He didn't seem very interested in this topic. He called many students out for things that wasted more time than they were worth. :: good. :: Very good easy going always came prepared. :: Very difficult to understand. I gave up listening in lecture about half-way through the semester. I had to use the book the entire time to try and learn myself. :: Sometimes explanations were not very clear and he expected us to understand a concept immediately after learning it, even when the applications were not intuitive. :: Went his own pace, examples were typically unclear, overall unproductive atmosphere. :: He is a terrible professor. His examples aren't that good. He doesn't teach well. He doesn't always handle questions well. The only good thing about his teaching is that if someone isn't paying attention he tries to get them to answer a question. :: Examples were clear and his questions and quizzes throughout class kept the students involved. :: provided adequate and extensive examples and was respectful. :: I tried to follow the examples in class, but it was nearly impossible.

Word problem. :: Not really. :: Yes by providing examples and explaining keys to solving hard problems. :: A little, the practice problems and exams posted on pilot were fairly helpful, as well as the book. :: He does not help with the understanding at all. He does not have good examples during class. I did not learn through the class. I couldn't figure out how to do the problems in the homework, but when the exams came around, I figured out how to do the questions by using knowledge from Physics 1 and the equations given on his equation sheet. I probably could have not shown up during class all semester and shown up during the exam and passed just by using the equation sheet. :: yes. Helped through good example problems. :: yes. :: While I'm sure Dr. Priezjev was trying his best to explain the problems, I just could not follow and learned basically nothing from him.

Both classes that I have taken with him have been beneficial to my degree program. :: none. :: I feel some topics could've been explained and practiced less in-depth, while some topics probably should've been explained a bit deeper, or maybe more general and then over time get more specific. :: He is not a good professor.

I think if the class was more engaging and the atmosphere a bit different and he worked on his teaching skills as far as connecting with the students and explaining questions, his overall teaching would be more effective. :: Do not let him teach anymore he is not a good professor. Sorry. :: The biggest thing that made your lectures hard to follow were the slides. There was way to much information on each lecture slide. You should try to break it into smaller manageable concepts. I also got lost with all of the variables. I don't think it was clearly defined from the beginning what everything represented and you moved too quickly for me to figure it out during class. For instance, in the work and energy equation, it took my friends and I almost two weeks before one of us realized that the variable U was work.  Furthermore, while you ask us if anyone has any questions you rarely actually pause to look up and answer them. There were many times people had their hand up, but you were looking down and said ""good"" and moved on. :: Nikolai is a very intelligent professor; that much is clear."

Going through examples in class helped a lot towards the end of the semester. However, teaching concepts through examples on a slide show I did not find helpful. During the class, the professor would click through the slides too fast and cause students to not have enough time to understand concepts. Having more explanation of problem processes would have been helpful too. :: kind of clear. :: Class time seemed very rushed. :: Difficult to understand at times, seemed to jump around alot and leave examples unfinished, confused students who were trying to understand how to be able to replicate the methods in homework and testing. :: Instructor didn't give time to work problems out or takes notes. Example problems were already worked out so it was hard to follow along. Shouldn't read straight from powerpoint. :: Great teacher, made topics very easy to understand, wish he could teach my upper level engineering classes. :: He is a good professor who knows the material very well. He is a little nervous when he lectures so it is hard to understand or hear him at some points, but other than that I enjoyed his class. :: Nikolai was not very responsive with questions during class time, even when he asked if there were any questions. Every one of the lectures was powerpoint that was read word for word from the slides. The examples gone over in class were always entry level material into the topic, never helping with the difficult questions that would appear on homework and exams. :: There were a lot of days that it was very hard to understand the material and whenever we work through problems in class, he speeds through them and it is hard to follow. :: He is clear for the most part. I think he tries really hard to try and get us to understand the material but I think he has a hard time teaching it to the students. I think he handles questions pretty well for the most part and respects the individuals. :: Examples problems were walked through during almost every lecture. A few more minutes could have been used for the ""quizzes"" during lecture. :: excellent professor would take again takes things slow and makes sure you understand them. The class is well defined and there is no excuse for anything. Well Done!. :: K. :: He was overall a decent professor.  He could provide better explanation on the different topics that we learn. Also, provide better office hours that work with the students schedules. :: Teaching dynamics off of pre-made PowerPoint slides made this class unbearable. Problems were almost never worked out on the board and could not really understand him very well. Tests were easy enough to do well, but the material was not taught well at all. :: clear explanation and handling question very good. :: He provided lots of examples, but some of the PowerPoint examples he went through too quickly to follow. :: Examples were very clear but were often much simpler than the homework. :: The examples were helpful, but I feel like some of the conceptual ones didn't help very much. More basic, specific problems would have been more useful. :: Did more lecturing than practical learning with doing problems, a lot of variable work problems that skipped many steps and were easy to get lost in. :: He was okay but he could've been better. I do not think PowerPoint presentations are the most effective way of teaching Dynamics, and that's what a lot of this course consisted of. He definitely knew what he was talking about but sometimes he did not know how to explain it very effectively. :: I think you're a very knowledgeable professor but the setup of the class and the lectures were not effective and not enough time was spent doing problems and understanding the material. Too much time was spent on the theoretical background and setup of equations or problems. I'm not the only one but most of the kids learn best when we see problems worked out and if equations are used that we don't understand or a concept we haven't seen before we're more inclined to ask questions about it. :: I felt like the majority of the time he would ramble about stuff that was not important or did not pertain to the class. It was very hard to stay awake and keep focused in that class. He answered questions to the best of his ability being able to answer any question asked. :: Teacher provided good examples in class. Sometimes the theory and process behind the examples were unclear. :: Very clear explanations, but required participation and critical thinking. :: Nikolai is very knowledgeable and help my understanding greatly. :: Excellent examples, always wanted students to learn. :: Gave clear understanding examples for each problem and thoroughly explained them. :: He was good in lecture."

The classes felt rushed though and he seemed to skip over explanations. :: yes. :: Yes. Brought in mechanisms for inperson examples, applied material to real life examples, and was helpful during office hours. :: No, what I gained from this class I mostly taught myself, because in class examples were not from relevant course materials, and could not be validated or the answers checked. most frustrating. :: Not much if any. :: he had very informative power points and explains them very well. :: brought models in to display certain topics. :: Up until this point I have done well in the class, but my understanding in the subject has been entirely based on myself reading through the book and working through the examples. This is how you must learn most of the material in most classes, but it is nice when a professor seems excited about the subject and is willing to help clarify difficult material, which Nikolai is not. :: Very little. All of the power points he had were not made by him and occasionally he wouldn't know what it was trying to do. He also would already have problems worked out that he would go over in class and instead of walking through a problem he would just copy what he already did.

Spent way too much time on theoretical happenings and did not touch on actual engineering examples. :: Dr. Sucosky was up front about the difficulty of the class. However, he explained the materials well and quickly responded to any questions that students had. He gave plenty of examples and was clear on what was expected out of students. :: Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor and one of the most intelligent people I have had the privilege to listen to. Does a great job at giving notes and material to the class that really contributes to the class learning. :: Materials supplied via the website where very helpful. :: His in class examples and explanations were clear. The homework however is greatly outside the realm of possibilities for students to be able to complete. :: I liked how he gave handouts with notes on them, so that we can fill in the blanks; it was easier to follow along and write the notes, while still paying attention to what he was saying. Class time was spent wisely. He taught the course very well, considering it is a hard subject. :: Some people have stated they feel as if he comes of a bit arrogant. I can not say I do not see what they are saying but I do not believe that it is intentional. :: Very helpful professor. One of the best I've had so far at Wright State. Homework and notes were clearly laid out. Willing to answer any questions and helpful during office hours as well. :: I did not like the way the homework was set up. I felt like my homework had to be perfect or my grade would suffer dramatically. :: Philippe gave handouts as examples, which really helped the learning of the material. The handouts further helped explain the information, and the tests were based off them. He respected everyone equally. :: He is a very good instructor, easy to understand, and explains the material well. :: Thank you. :: Lectures were put together excellently. This is a very difficult course but the material provided made everything much easier. Being able to use resources such as our notes, handouts, and practice exams on the exams makes it easier to understand and show my obtained knowledge. :: Very clear in explanations of coursework. Class was very well organized and seldom strayed off topic. He engaged the class well with guided notes and interactive simulations. He was very straightforward to the class about student expectations, responsibilities, and potential outcomes. Every piece of information that was necessary to excel on the tests and homework was provided to students in class or on his course website. He is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the subject and did his best to appeal to the level of knowledge of the students when answering questions and explaining difficult concepts. There were no surprises throughout the class because of how well it was organized and I feel that as a whole, students would be much more successful if all classes were structured like Sucosky's. I definitely learned a lot about the fundamentals of fluid mechanics throughout the semester. :: Dr. Sucosky is among the top 5% of the best professors I have had the pleasure of learning from. He is highly organized in his presintation of information and able to answer complex questions with understandable answers. Thank you for the time spent with us. :: the instructor has a strict system that works on making the students learning the material. :: Dr. Sucosky was excellent in covering new topics and going over examples. :: Overall handled questions well. :: Not good, class time just keep  writing and reading it's not writing class. :: The problem I had was that he gave homework that he said not to study for the exam because they wouldn't be similar enough, but my study consists of doing homework. I don't have time to do homework that will be useless, then also study what is expected. :: I appreciate his approach to the material. :: Very organized professor, everything is very clear. If you have any questions, go up to his office hours and he will gladly help you. His tests are exactly what he says they will be and his review sessions are extremely helpful."
263,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Spring,ME 3350,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Instructor did a poor job of conveying useful information. Expectations of students were unclear in expectations for exams. Did not explain how any of the information we learned was applicable to any real-life scenarios. :: Yes, he did. Made sure he went through every step in his example problems and note taking to make sure the students had clear idea on what to do, even with the extremely difficult material that is studied in fluid dynamics. :: Again, he was a clear teacher. But homework is impossible to complete. :: Yes, he gave real-world examples of things we were learning about. For example, one day he showed us how the velocity of air flows through an f1-formula car. I thought that was very interesting and it greatly sparked my interest in the subject. :: He focused far too much on thorough and far to little on application. more example work and less how we get there would be extremely helpful. :: Yes. Homework and notes were extremely helpful and could be used on tests. Practice exams were given for each exam as well as a review session was held. Very helpful overall. :: He provided very helpful handouts. :: He did help aid in my understanding. Sometimes the information being wrote out was a little much, but overall the notes were helpful. :: Yes. :: Yes, awesome. :: As I said above, the class was well structured and all material necessary for learning the topic was provided in the class and on his website. The book was mainly used for reinforcement and more in depth ""next level"" learning development. The instructor most definitely aided in my understanding of the subject because the students expectations and outcomes were clearly outlined in his class syllabus and everyday lecture. There were no surprises and I think many professors could learn a thing or two about how to structure a class from Sucosky. Intelligent, straightforward, and honest. :: yes, he made sure I learned all the material by taking notes and using handouts. :: Any questions I had, Dr. Sucosky was able to answer. :: Yes. Answered all my questions in class. :: No. :: I think he could have spent more time on examples. We spent days on proving the equation, then twenty minutes on an example of how to use it. When it came to the exam, the example was there, but in situations I hadn't seen or anticipated because I didn't know to anticipate them. After the first exam, we got examples of what to expect, the only problem was only one out of every three was something I had seen and could figure out how to solve properly. :: He did, as everything was extremely clear and organized. :: He did go over handouts and notes, but he did not give very many concrete examples. It was hard with the homework being so different from the things that were done in class to learn the material. Test questions were different than the homework and were very challenging."
264,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Spring,ME 3350,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Below average instructor. :: Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor. I have no complaints about him, as he is a smart and intelligent man with a gift in teaching. My only issue was he did not respond to an email about one of my finals (potential grading issue), but it wasn't a huge deal. :: Lower the difficulty of the homework. :: Overall, he is a great professor. Taught the class very well and his exams were fair. :: I was extremely interested in this class it was in fact probably the class I wanted to take most out of all required classes in my degree. But this class has become nothing more than a chore. We learned so little about how to actually solve for dynamic fluid problems and so much on base theories most of which we will not utilize. :: Thanks. :: Awesome style of teaching. :: No additional comments. :: Nothing. :: He was available for consultation yes, and he said people who came to his office often passed with higher grades. I would have liked it if he spent more time teaching what he expected us to know. I work, so I can't go to office hours all the time, I go to class to learn what I need to know.. only that it feels like he teaches everything EXCEPT what we are expected to know. :: He is a very cool professor who clearly knows what he is talking about. If you cannot make it to his office hours, he will work with you in order to get you what you need. Overall a very good experience in the class."
265,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Spring,ME 3350,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Looked down on students. Assumed that if you didn't understand material immediately, you never would understand it. :: Dr. Sucosky is a great professor. The material in this course is naturally difficult, but if one does as Dr. Sucosky instructs the course becomes a lot more manageable. :: Thank you for a great semester!. :: Lower the difficulty of the homework. :: One thing that I did not like was how he gave much harder problems on the homeworks than he did on the exams. I would have liked it better if he gave the same amount of difficulty on the homeworks as the exams. Alot of the homeworks i had a very hard time trying to solve them. If the homework was easier, it would have given us more practice problems similar to what is on the exams. :: It is very helpful that the homework is worth 25% of the grade but It is so difficult compared the book/exam problems. If the homework represented problems that we would more likely see on an exam it would have been more beneficial. :: Great teaching. :: He is a great teacher and very strict. :: No comment s. :: Nothing. :: Awesome professor who makes a challenging class a little bit easier to grasp."

279,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Spring,ME 4340,Question 14,"Additional comments--- One of the main adjustments I can think of is to include more use of Fluent in preparation for the semester project.

I learned way more about comp methods in this course than I ever did in the class taught by Nicolai.

I remember so much from his classes because of the way he sets up lectures and exams. Even if it is a challenging subject, you still learn a lot and can do well grade wise. :: I felt Dr. Yang did a decent job teaching this course. I was aware going into the course it was his first time teaching the course, and at times it was apparent. He did have some questions where he seemed a bit confused and took extra time to look up the answer.

We were allowed to use the textbooks during the exam, but that wasn't much help on the problem, either.  A nearly identical problem appeared on a homework assignment he had assigned just a few days earlier.  If a piece of material is going to appear on the exam, the teacher should discuss it ahead of time.

Writing on the board can sometimes be a tad small and hard to read. :: Very good. :: Hard to follow along with what he is explaining sometimes, not real clear in explanations. :: Sometimes seemed to get confused when someone asked a question or clarification but he did very well in explaining when he understood what was being asked. :: Would like more working out of problems in class and less theory explanation. :: Dr. Bae did a very good job teaching this material.  I always enjoy his classes.  He does a lot of examples and really takes the time to help us learn the material. :: Very good examples and explanations to in class problems that helped me understand the material. :: Dr. Bae knows and taught the subject of Vibration of Mechanics very well.  Consequently, Dr. Bae instructing ethics has not been ""up to par"" (fair); to illustrate this,  Dr. Bae has penalized students for grievances he wasn't clear on (he never declared he would penalize), however, he did not penalize students for grievances he was clear on (he did say he would penalize on syllabus).  This type of teaching (inconsistencies) makes it unfair for all students that are under his instructing.  I think Dr. Bae has the potential of becoming a great teacher, but his bad ethical practices is one great hindrance to him and this great institution: I have had other master level students complain about his bad ethics.  This is constructive criticism and nothing personal.  As a matter of fact there has been time when Dr. Bae has shown good ethics with his students; consequently, this is very rare occurrence with Dr. Bae: hence he has potential of becoming a great professor. Thanks GAA. :: He could write a little bigger on the board. Depending on where you sit, it is difficult to see what is written. :: Teaching was fairly well done. Sometimes had trouble figuring out what was being taught in class, and how it was different from previously learned material. :: Lots of examples which were helpful. :: I believe that Dr. Bae showed us many examples of everything that he expected of us. He was clear and precise on everything. :: I felt like matlab was useless in this class. It is required to be able to do it on the homework which is useful but then can not be used on the exam. :: The written notes on Pilot were helpful when reviewing and doing homework.  Numerous examples were covered in class for each topic.  The matlab code is helpful and helps students understand the solving procedure. :: Examples were good and the instruction sound.  However the presentation was difficult.  PDF notes were projected onto the white board - not a screen, so there was a glare.  Half of the lights were on, so the dim lighting made the projection harder to read and the white-board handwriting difficult to read.  All handwriting was difficult to read.  The PDF notes were too small to read from the middle of the room. Office hours were good though, and the professor was patient in his explanations. :: Lectures were useful. Definitely helped for exams. Exams had questions that were prepared so that they tested knowledge of the subject without any major tricks. :: While there is a small difficulty understanding some words from time to time, Dr. Bae is very good about making sure that the students understand the material and the content he is trying to relay. The examples always help in understanding the theory and formulas. He is very open to questions, and does a very good job answering them satisfactorily. He does a great job with providing conceptual examples to understand the problems. :: he is one of the best in ME. :: Examples are good, but instructor is sometimes hard to understand. :: Explained topics well despite his accent and treated students well. :: The examples in class made it clear on how to use the principles being taught, and what each variable was explained in depth. The class can clearly be a difficult class to teach, and Dr. Bae did a great job.  The only negative opinion I have of the class was trying to keep notes. As I was writing notes I had a hard time keeping up with the notes he would write in class and the notes that were projected on the board. It made it difficult to keep up with the writing and pay attention to the lesson. :: I felt that to much of the class this semester revolved around reading straight from the notes on the projector. I've had Dr. Bae Previously and he was an excellent professor. Felt as though he wasn't as confident on this material. :: Dr. Ha-Rok Bae was always good at answer questions of students in a clear and straight forward manner. Unless the answer was about to come up in the next portion of the lecture, then he would have the student wait to see if the question was answered after the lecture covered the material. :: Most classes were spent doing examples which really helps in the understanding of the material. Most professors only focus on content with no examples making the class difficult to understand. This is not one of those classes. :: Dr. Bae is one of the better professor's at the university. Funny guy bringing some levity to the dry material. :: Needs to spend more time on examples and not just going over the notes that are given. Just make students read before class and then do problems. :: Gives good examples. I have enjoyed the chapter 4 lectures, but I thought CH 1-3 were boring. That's more of an issue with content than teaching style though. :: Dr. Bae is one of my favorite professors at WSU, everything was fine. :: Very Clear. My third time taking him in a class, and I Love his classes. :: The professor's teaching is good. The explanation and examples are not up to the standard of exam conducted. :: From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding. He answers each and every questions or doubts. :: From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding.

319,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 4210,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes reviewing multiple examples helped. :: Yes, I saw him in his office for help on the homework and he helped me to make sense of the material. :: Dr. Bae aided in my understanding by answering my questions through email and after class. :: The instructor did aid in my understanding of the subject through the examples he did in class. Homework that was assigned was also a good way to learn the various subjects we were talking about. :: Yes he did. :: Not at all, almost everything I learnt during the class was self taught. Dr. Bae has a teaching style that is hard to follow and at most times doesn't make sense. :: In some regards yes, it was sometimes hard to figure out what exactly we were solving for in a problem or what certain variables meant. :: Very much so. :: Dr. Bae does a great job of taking the time to explain the material to us.  The only criticism I would give is that the notes could be hard to follow in class and I wasn't always sure what material was important to record, and what material should not be recorded.  The class was very fast paced, so this made it difficult to follow as Dr. Bae would switch between the notes and examples and it could get confusing. :: Yes Dr Bae gave real world examples that I could relate to which made the material easier. :: Dr. Bae has the potential of aiding, but he tends to discourage students from asking questions; to illustrate, he compares other students ability to figure out a problem quicker than that student that couldn't (office hours): which can disable a student from asking for aid from Dr. Bae.  Besides that, he taught the subject very well. :: Yes. He would stay after class to help answer some question we had or would ask us to come to his office hours. :: Yes, was able to visually show how an object would move by using Matlab. Which also helped to see how changing the parameters affected the system. :: Yes, I learned alot. :: Yes, Dr, Bae was much more clear than the book for this course and made sure that we understood everything before moving on. :: Dr. Bae simplified each solving method into a list of simple steps to break down problems. He also went through matlab code to show how these steps are used and how they work together. :: Yes. He answered conceptual questions to the best of his ability. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was always very open to questions and helpful in answering them in or out of class. :: yes does a great job. :: I asked for clarification on a topic and he cleared up the confusion. :: Dr. Bae did a great job explaining, answering questions, and knowing when the class was overwhelmingly confused. He would stop periodically to ask the class if there were questions and would take time to make sure the questions were answered. :: Yes, some examples were helpful. :: Yes, I had a question about mode shape responses and he was able to meet with me directly after class to clear up my confusion. :: Yes. As stated above the examples really help to build an understanding of the material and how to apply it. :: Yes, he likes to use colorful MATLAB plots to demonstrate a vibration analysis. Again, helps create more interest in the subject. :: Yes. good professor.  Good person. :: Yes, he gives good lectures and the homeworks were extensive. :: yes. :: Yes he did. He provided numerous examples, and stimulated thinking. :: Yes, Professor helps in getting the clarity of the subject and specific topics. Dr. Bae clarified my doubt related objects response to resonance conditions and the possibility to create virtual machine which can convert excess resonance energy to useful form. :: Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of this subject. Dr. Bae used to give real life applications of the theory and he even showed the examples in matlab to broaden our concepts in mechanical vibration. :: Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of this subject.

320,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 4210,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- I thought the class was taught well. :: No further comment. :: Poor teaching style. :: Dr. Bae did a great job when showing how to solve the ""Vibration of Mechanics"" problems using Mat Lab: according to what I have learn previously in Mat Lab. :: While being able to view the PDF on pilot greatly helped, I had trouble following some of the material when the PDF was used in class. :: Dr. Bae is an excellent professor. :: nope. :: N/a. :: It would seem that the lab and the lecture are not even related. The labs are months ahead in the material and really only provide as an exercise in MATLAB than anything to do with vibration analysis. Painful 4 weeks. :: No. :: The homeworks were often very long and time consuming, I think it could serve for those to be cut down and targeted closer to the types of problems on exams. 5-6 problems per homework would have been better than 10-12 problems. :: One of the best engineering professors here at Wright State. :: Everything was good except the time given to solve problems. The time was insufficient to perform to my full extent. :: Mechanical vibration is very challenging subject but, Dr. Bae helped me in understanding the subject by answering my doubts and query. I used to meet Dr. Bae on regular basis to get deep understanding of the concepts of vibration. :: Mechanical vibration is very challenging subject but, Dr. Bae helped me in understanding the subject by answering my doubts and query.

321,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 4210,Question 14,"Additional comments--- I thought this class wasn't too bad.  I know it's the hardest in the major and I thought the intuition a gained from this class will be useful.  The ability to research more on my own and do a deeper analysis if I am required isn't out of the question either.  Thanks Dr. Bae. :: I would suggest providing some solutions to the homework assignments before the homework is due. This helps in learning if the students get stuck so they can see how the problem is properly solved rather than doing it wrong the first time and thinking it is right. :: Overall the class was taught fairly well. The examples were good and the homework helped aid in the understanding of these examples. The labs were alright but they it was hard sometime to understand and follow along with what the lab was looking for. :: None. :: When student's would find mistakes in the notes he posted online in Pilot, he didn't make note of the changes so he could correct the notes at a later date. It's unknown if he ever went back and re-uploaded corrected notes. Anyone who missed that class or stepped out of the room for those few minutes when the correction was brought up would never know, and could possibly have now incorrect formulas or methods on crib sheets or homework. :: Dr. Bae did a great job and I enjoy his classes!. :: All the info I have provided has been only the truth and nothing personal (not trying get anyone in trouble); I would hope this will generate a healthy dialogue for Dr. Bae. :: MATLAB codes were useful, but they weren't allowed on exams. Because of this, some of the homework wasn't very useful for studying for exams. :: the crib sheets i want to keep so do not write on them. :: N/a. :: adsf. :: I could tell that Dr. Bae liked FEA more than vibrations. We had so much fun in FEA. :: Great class, I enjoyed it.  Thanks!. :: Dr.Bae is so helpful for graduate students. He is a knowledgeable person. He can clarify any doubt related to the subject. :: The labs performed were very useful and taught in a very well manner."

Most of the information in the lab manual was not well explained or collected in a readable manner. :: Lab time was spent horribly, most of the labs we stood for the whole class period and never had to do a thing. Then we would collect data that the TA did for us and leave without any explanation on how to use the matlab functions that were required to get your results. :: Labs were long but related to class so that helped make them easier. :: The labs were often repetitive and given with such instruction that put the focus on understanding matlab and not about understanding what was going on. :: Labs were taken from when Dr. Slater took it, so the TA wasn't always familiar with the material. He was helpful with what he did know, but many things he did not know. :: Class was actually handled by a TA.  Explanations of labs were straightforward, demonstrations helpful. :: Explained topics well, answered questions with clarity, and treated student very respectfully. :: Sazzad did the best that he could with what he had to work with. Labs were silly as students barely use the software and basically show up to strike a beam or wing with an impulse measurement hammer. Labs were was ahead of the material and so I had little to no clue as to what I was doing."

334,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 4210L,Question 13,Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- I think if the lab manuals were easier to read and the lab was explained a little better it would be easier to understand what was happening. :: Re-evaluate this lab. Space them out or provide more explicit written instructions. It can be hard to understand or hear the in-lab instructions and therefore once I'm home weeping at my keyboard and Matlab displaying errors in red I've no clue what variables correspond to what and what equations to use. Yay college!
335,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 4210L,Question 14,Additional comments--- I think there needs to be more hands on portions to the lab. :: Students are so uninvolved during the lab sessions that it might have been equally beneficial to have the experiments video recorded and distributed with the lab data for people to use. This might be more useful than sitting there confused for 2 hours and then being given data for matlab to go home and figure out.

Not always because the data was flawed, although it was occasionally, but mostly because the lab did not teach us how to appropriately analyze the data and the lab was way ahead of the material that we learned in class.  So it made it absurd and not very useful. :: The lab was a little less well put together in my opinion.

Generally like the labs were hitting something with a hammer and praying for the best in results from the computer, other than that not much was explained in any clarity. :: Labs did not line up with lectures also did not beinifit to learning just made understanding harder it took time away from homework and studying just adding difficulty with no gain. :: The lab was explained all the way through using the lab manual and the TA was very helpful when obtaining the experimental data."

I kind of enjoyed seeing the results of the labs.  I think this could be a very fun lab. I think the theory parts for lab were a bit of overkill in some respects.

However, the lab reports were challenging.  Most importantly, the lab reports were much farther ahead then the class homework assignments, which made it harder to apply what we learned in class to the labs; unfortunately, this made the lab reports unnecessarily more confusing on interpreting the info we obtained. :: The prelab lesson was not clear. We jumped from page to page and it was hard to comprehend all of the material. The matlab was extremely hard to do by yourself. I do not like to ask to many questions and found it difficult to figure out. When the lab was being conducted the instructor did a very good job. He knew how to use to use the program and how to explain what the information was we were looking for. :: It's fine that you wanted to challenge us in this course, but you didn't quite nail giving us all the tools we needed.  The main issue was a lack of explanation of the functions that we were required to use or what they did.  Now granted, they probably where explained in each lab, but a single typed up chart to explain what the inputs are (I.e. units and where the program got them) and what the outputs are (units) in a single typed up sheet with the words ""DO NOT LOSE"" might be a better option than the piece meal version."

416,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 7210,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Clarity of explanations - The instructor repeats the explanation that is provided in the recommended textbook. I don't understand the point of coming to the class if I have to read and hear the same lines. Examples - Same as above. The instructor didn't take efforts to solve examples outside of the textbook. More emphasis was given on completion of the course syllabus rather than the student's understanding. :: Personally, I would prefer that less lecture time is spent on the derivations of various equations. Although derivations are helpful for understanding the assumptions involved in various methods, examples of how the equations are used are much more effective at helping to cement the method in my mind. I'm not saying to focus exclusively on examples. It would just be nice to shift the balance a bit. I would also have appreciated it if Dr. Bae used some examples which didn't come directly from the text. That way, more than one example would be available to help clarify the use of the different methods. Finally, it would be more manageable if the homework assignments were split into smaller assignments due more frequently. :: The professor needs to do more examples that aren't straight from the book. After seeing only one example, it was very difficult to do the homework and do well on the tests. :: Good. :: Because the book is not easy to read and understand, for me the examples are important to understand the class. But the example is not enough, it makes me hard to catch up the class. Handout material also could not help me a lot.  But this is the first time Dr. Bae teach this course, so it is could be understood for his difficulty. :: excellent method for teaching and also answer all of the students questions during the class. :: Everything was well organised. :: Instructor was clear with his teaching and examples . Answered the question to the point with valid explanation. Instructor respect the individual and allow student to speak and ask question during lecture hours. :: -Instructor provided good explanation of all topics of this course along with many examples. He also used to asks question during class that allows us to think on that topic. He also used to respect each individuals. He used to clear the doubts of each individual till that students get clear understanding. :: Dr. Bae is an overall good professor and this course went as well as it probably could have being his first time teaching it.  One improvement that could be made adding more examples (beyond what is included in the textbook) and having a solution to the homework available before the homework is assigned so he can more easily help students on homework if they have trouble.  One minor thing, when doing equations on the board, please write your ""w"" and ""omega"" symbols differently.  It was difficult to tell sometimes when he was talking about displacement (w) or natural frequency (omega).  Also, always be sure to use different symbols for different quantities, for example towards the beginning of the class there was a mix up between ""H"" for the hamiltonian and the ""H"" matrix. I would also like to see more numerical methods taught in this course rather than just the theory since this is ""computational"" methods for structural dynamics.  Other than those minor things, job well done for the first time teaching the course. :: 1) During my Graduation, Dr. Bae is one of best professor and always very helpful. 2) He explaining example very well during the class so that we can easily solve the homework problem even in exam problem too. 3) Dr. Bae is awesome. He explain everything very well and I learned a lot from him. If I get a chance, I would like to be a future student under him. And suggest other student also to be a part of it. 4) He is very energetic during class and always positive. He is very respectful and cares about the whole class. 5) He gave us excellent knowledge about different kind of software like MATLAB, Mathematica. :: The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students. I like the way he took personal care of the problems arose from the individual students. :: Good"
417,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 7210,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared for class. Im sure he will get better when he gets more experience teaching the course. :: Yes. :: He really tried to make sure all students understand the class, but it is hard to know comprehend all knowledge in class. :: yes definitely. at the starting off the class he took a per-requisite test for this subject. and he also provide all the materials for study. its really good that he took that test because we can have some basic of this subject clear. :: Yes. :: yes instructor was helpful in understanding this subject. Any doubt asked was cleared with an example which help in understanding the subject and also did relative examples in class to help understanding the structure. :: -Yes instructor aided in understanding this subject well. He used to clear my doubts during class time or even after class in office hours. He used to give different examples so that I can understand the topic well. :: Yes. :: As I said earlier that I like the way he teaching the subject by explaining everything very well.  And understanding of example during the class helps in exam and homework problem. I was challenged in this course but Dr. Bae made easy to understand this subject. :: Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept. :: Yes, Classes have been interesting."
418,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 7210,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- To be honest, I don't understand the point of appointing an instructor if all he does is re-write whatever is given in the textbook with no additional information. It would have saved the students a lot of money and time if they were directly told to read the textbook and appear for an exam. :: Nothing else. :: Please, please add more example to help students understand the knowledge. If possible, teach some knowledge about the software you used in class. If possible, change the book, it is not friendly to students (like me). :: No further comments. Instructor was fluent with his teaching and examples. :: -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor. :: This class is very important and has many application in my focused area in future or in job.  Great teaching in all subject that I had took under him. He has excellent knowledge about software. :: Everything is good"
419,Ha-Rok Bae,2017 Spring,ME 7210,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Examples - More examples from outside the recommended textbook will go a long way in helping the student's learning. :: This is the first time to Dr. Bae teach this class? This is a really hard course, hope he can help more students to understand the techniques used in this class. :: -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor. :: At the last, Dr. Bae is very very very good professor. :: I would like to take the subjects in future under this instructor. :: This is not regarding the Professor. Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly. This will benefit every one who is interest but kind of feel tough to grasp the teachings."

She respected all individuals equally. :: Dr. Gockel did a good job using examples, answering questions, and explaining the material effectively for the students to learn. :: Dr. Gockel was a fantastic professor and  was very clear in every thing she expected from her students. :: Sometimes explanations were vague and confusing, but she did well handling questions from the class and did her best to guide students to understand the topic more clearly. First year teaching the course and it was noticeable. :: Very clear real world explanations. :: The examples in class were very useful to reflect on while doing the homework. Since there are a TON of equations, it was nice to have some examples that used them. The homework was actually useful to do, unlike many of the other courses I have taken at Wright State. The exams were similar to the homework problems, which seems to be an oddity in the engineering classes. She handled any questions I had, and answered anyone's questions in class. :: In class she was fine.  She provided both theory and real-world examples.  She would go a little too fast at times, and wouldn't thoroughly explain every step to every problem sometimes. :: Provided great examples and taught them well. :: clarity of explanations and examples. :: Very clear instruction. Structured and straightforward notes and lecture organization, really appreciated that. Lecture was from 7:40-9pm, but didn't feel bogged down or slow due to the later meeting time. :: Dr. Gockel was very clear in lecturing, whether it was discussing new topics or going over examples. :: Clarity and speed was good. :: Very clear instructor, with plenty of helpful examples and useful homework problems. She encourages the class to ask questions, and gladly answers all of them. Her exams were clear and tested over the material covered. :: The instructor did quite well with questions and worked out a lot of helpful examples. :: Dr. Gockel comes to class prepared with both new material and effective examples every class period. She clearly reviews the material prior to teaching it. Many of her examples incorporate both prior material, and newly learned material. :: very good instructior"
431,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 3120,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Her examples were well thought out and demonstrated her points with clarity. Any further questions were answered in a timely manner in or out of class.  The class as she structured it was very linear and therefor easy to move from topic to topic throughout the semester. :: She forced us to use programming on our project, which helped show how much we had learned. :: Yes she aided in our learning. She made sure to keep the class engaged since the class was at a late time in the day. :: Dr. Gockel did an excellent job in helping myself learn the subject. She went through examples that helped backup the concepts. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, I asked for some help when it came to the assigned project and she pointed me in the right direction with ideas that I hadn't thought of. :: Yes, to a point.  The homework probably taught me more than anything. :: yes. :: aid in your understanding of this subject. :: Dr. Gockel was able to answer any and all questions I asked her. :: Yes, she helped me learn all that was expected in the course, again with helpful examples and clear exams. :: Any questions I asked, whether in class or during office hours, were answered clearly and concisely. :: yes"
432,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 3120,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- We were given 4 weeks instead of 8 to work on a semester project, which was complete nonsense and I completely object to. Assigning a major project with half the allotted time listed in the syllabus was a total foul. :: Halfway through the class she gave us a break which I strongly believe helped keep us engaged during lecture. Knowing we had a 5-10 minute break also helped the class time go quicker and not drag. :: Only issues I really had was taking too long of a break during the class. She usually would give a 5 minute break halfway through. I would rather just have pressed through and finished early. Also, she wrote slightly too small for certain parts of the room to see. Other than that, no problems. :: Nice woman, good teacher. I'd take her again for other courses. :: She could sometimes be a little vague, and I feel as though she was a little bit unorganized when it came to a comprehensive list of what we've learned.  I didn't feel like things really related from lesson to lesson. :: NOTHING. :: The division of the class time was great. She allowed for a small break, in order for everyone to clear their heads and stretch their legs, and then continued on teaching. Overall a nicely organized class. :: none"
433,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 3120,Question 14,"Additional comments--- When you are approached by a student brave enough and in need of help, for crying out loud, help them and give them a straight forward answer. You were most frustrating in this regard. :: I really wish she was available more during the day.  She's not a bad teacher by any means.  I feel like graded work was a little unfair, as I was marked off on minor mistakes.  The project was also somewhat unfair I feel, as we weren't told anything about it until the last month of school.  I think if the project were assigned halfway through the semester it'd be a little more reasonable. :: NOTHING. :: none"

444,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 4140,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Professor Gockel is a highly motivated individual, who is organized in her teaching methods. While lecturing she breaks down the information into chunks that follow the syllabus to a point. When it comes to answering questions she is respectful of students, not simply saying ""no"", ""incorrect"" or ""not even close"" she tries to understand where the students question is coming from. Giving an opportunity to explain why the question was brought up initially, and how to solve for the students question. She not only teaches the subject at hand but as well as critical thinking skills. :: Joy was easily one of the best professors I've had at wright state. She provided several examples throughout the class and made sure to allow time for students to ask questions. Everything in the class seemed fair and she treated everyone with respect during the duration of the course. I really wish I had the opportunity to have her as a professor again. :: Overall, instructor was good. However exams were slightly ambiguous and more challenging than previous examples. :: Dr. Gockel is a very good professor, she is very good with the subject and was quick to reply to  questions the students had. :: She does a lot of examples and answers a lot of questions to further our understanding.  She also gives pop quizzes every once in a while to keep us sharp.  The final project is a great way for us to apply what we've learned. :: Very clear. Told you what she wanted you to know. Exams were a little over the top though. :: She was a very good teacher, always answered any questions right away clearly and always respected her class. :: The instructor was average with regards to this. :: Lectures were straight to the point and notes given were extremely helpful for homework as well as exams. Everything was explained in a clear and concise manner. :: Dr. Gockel was very good at explaining things in a clear and concise manner. She also handled questions from the class well and also was able to inject a lot of real world information into the lectures. :: She is easily the best instructor I had this semester when is comes to teaching the courses material. I learn more in her one week review of mechanics of materials course than I learned the in the whole previous Mechanic of materials course. :: yes. :: Spent class understanding equations needed to solve problems. :: Clear examples, responded to questions clearly, concisely, and helpfully, and was always respectful. :: Ava;iable during office hours, kind and was good at helping answer questions. :: Professor Gockel always treated the class and the questions of the student with great respect and provided us with organized material that she tried to make as clear as possible. :: Very good at explaining things and handling questions. :: Very clear. Easy to understand. Willing to slow things down so people actually understand. :: The teacher has a well made system in teaching this course. I enjoyed this class very much from the way she taught it. she used class time very well and did example problems to make sure the students know what they are doing. :: No additional comments. :: Her teachung style was very easy to listen to and understand. The examples she did were applicable and dine in an orderly and simple way. She made it easy to speak up in class and provided overall a good learning environment. :: The professor was very clear in her explanation of the material. She frequently asked questions to keep the students engaged and to see how well we were following along."
445,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 4140,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- For Mechanical Design, Professor Gockel was always open to new ideas and questions relative to better understanding lecture. For whatever questions that were asked she would lead you in the right direction but allow you to arrive at the conclusion. By doing this it makes learning the material easier and more effective. :: Yes, Joy was available during and outside of office hours to provide extra help. I had needed to meet her one day and she was respectful and helpful in making sure we understood the topic before we left her office. :: Instructor was very good at explaining concepts. :: She's cool brah. :: The material that she taught in the class was helpful for me to succeed in her class. she good helpful explanations. :: Not overly.Â  Most of this class was self taught. Of the lecture time, we spent maybe 10% going over what we truly needed. The rest of the time was spent going through long mathematical proofs on how we derived the formulas for our calculations in the first place. The class should be about application.Â  If we want to know were our approaches come from, we should simply take the initiative to find that portion on our own. We are tested over our ability to apply these formulas to situations.Â  As such, our time should be spent learning how to apply, not how we obtained the approach in the first place. I can safely say little of class time was beneficial to learning how to do anything in the real world. :: Very willing to answer any questions that arose in class. All homework was related to material that was just covered in class and was comparable to questions that were given all the exams. Had flexible office hours if students needed extra help. :: Absolutely. The lectures were very organized and easy to follow even when the content was difficult. :: yes. :: Dr. Gockel provided lots of theory in class and spent time making sure the equations were explained in class. :: Yes. She provided good examples hat were neither too simple to be connected to assignments, nor too hard to understand. :: Yes. Her weekly quizzes helped me know how I was doing with the conceptual portion of this class and assisted in me in making sure that I knew how to attack most problems when considering my approach. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, she used example problems to teach the material. :: No additional comments. :: She was very helpful in my understanding if this subject. I don't know if there is a specific example, but just they way she teaches makes thing easier to grasp than someone else might."
446,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 4140,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- The tests are absolutely inexcusably too long. Never before have I been in a class where I was unable to finish a test due to simple time, rather than clarity of material. At no point did I stall or was I held up in any way on the test material, yet I was unable to finish in time. We had a 55 minute test, including time to hand out, and there were 11 parts, not counting the graduate problem.Â  Even if the tests were able to be instantaneously handed out, this is only 5 minutes per part. During our final class day Dr. Gockle actually stated ""it is my goal to create a test that 25% are done with 30 minutes remaining. By the end to have 50% to 75% to be finished"".Â  By stating this, it means she aims for 25%-50% of the class to be incapable of finishing her test in the allotted time. This is completely irreprehensible. Some have stated that is actually the schoolâs goal.Â  If this is true, and I hope it is not, it is still irreprehensible as we are paying costumers not people being done a favor. We pay to be educated on the material.Â  As such, the goal should be to help us learn the material.Â  And with learning as the main focus, on a fair test, anyone who did notÂ  make truly poor decisions regarding learning the material should have no problem finishing the test and achieve an average grade, that being a C.Â  It seems as though her goal is to be certain that some of us fail, rather than learn.Â  And with an intentional lack of adequate time, she is not judging our knowledge at all, but rather how quickly we can guess. :: Best ME professor in College of Engineering. :: Often times, I felt we spent class time deriving/ learning too many equations but not solving problems. While I was in class, it made sense but trying problems on my own were often times difficult and I had little to no examples to reference.  Exams were setup to take the entire class period assuming no mistakes were made, they felt a little long. :: No further comments. :: Tests were unfair for the 55 minute time block. Material was fair just to much of it. :: Professor Gockel seems like a very nice and respectful person that is very enthusiastic about her job. I have learned  a ton thanks to her teaching. :: No additional comments. :: Just that when I say she made it easy to learn that doesn't mean the material was necessarily easy. It was pretty hard, but she gave the right tools to be able to figure out the work."
447,Joy Gockel,2017 Spring,ME 4140,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Wonderful professor, cannot wait to take Mechanical Design 2! :). :: She is a very good instructor. :: Best teacher I've had this semester and maybe ever at Wright State. Wish I had a chance to take her again. :: Everything in her class was reasonable. The only issue I had was the two mid-terms were too long for the given time frame. :: The material on the exams was very fair, my only complaint was that it was a lot of material to cover in only a 55 minute exam time frame. :: No further comments. :: A very good professor. I would definitely take another class taught by her again. :: I enjoyed the class interaction that the instructor demonstrated, such as continuously asking questions of the class. :: You are an excellent teacher keep up the good work. :: No additional comments. :: I really enjoyed this class."

458,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 2210,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Very clear on what was needed to be known for exams. Always provided examples. He made me feel confident going into exams. :: Gave clear explanations and answered questions well. :: Good professor with lots of examples. Only downfall is he writes out rhw whole problem word for word on the board and it can get quite long and drawn out. :: He would explain and give good examples. Ask question to try to make us think. :: Thorough and efficient in his teaching style. Gave us lots of example problems in class and very concise review sessions before exams so that we knew what to expect. He didn't mess around or try to trip us up, the class structure was very well defined and straight forward. :: Examples were helpful in clarifying needed points or special cases. Questions were adeptly answered. :: teaching was kind of dry, very monotone, did do examples in the lecture which was nice, could do something to make the class more interesting. :: Teaching was clear and easy to understand.  Provided a good number of example problems we went through in class which was very helpful.  All around great teacher and a good guy. :: The instructor went through many examples during class time and made sure that the class understood them. He also made sure the students know that if they understood the in class problems then they would do well on the exam. :: very good instructor. :: As Sheng Li lectures he writes down nearly everything on the white board. (This is very useful!) At the beginning of class he explains the general principles and equations and next he demonstrates how to use those equations & principles to solve problems by applying them to several examples. His examples are chosen to show how these equations and principles can be used in different real world situations. He tries to make solving these examples an interact process by asking us what the next step might be. After all he is teaching problem solving. He would always ask if we had questions and always answered them to the best of his ability.  As for respect for individuals and their differences, I assume he met that criteria since the topic never crossed my mind until this survey mention it. This was never an issue in this class."
459,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 2210,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes. The examples that were provided through out class gave a clear outline of what was needed for the exams. :: Yes. :: Yes if asked a question he would do his best to try and explain. :: Yes. He would give good examples and explain very well. :: Yes, explained things in relatable ways with plenty of examples as I said above. :: ehh. not really. :: The number and clarity of examples helped my understanding of Dynamics. :: yes. :: He went over pretty much everything he had listed in the Syllabus, explaining each topic completely and demonstrating the all the equations and formulas each topic generated. I was very satisfied with his lectures. His whiteboard notes were legible enough, pertinent, and comprehensive. If  a student took very good notes they would only need to refer to the text book occasionally for help.  It is hard to single out specific examples: his teaching style was consistent lecture to lecture. In each lecture he would define and explain the topic matter and then demonstrate how the newly introduces principles could be used for problem solving by utilizing a variety of examples that would utilize those principles various ways to arrive at a solution. He kept things simple and straightforward."
460,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 2210,Question 13,Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- nope. :: N/a. :: He made sure we knew what we were being tested on. Did not give us curve balls. Good professor. :: he was either right on time or late to every class period. :: none. :: No further comment.
461,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 2210,Question 14,"Additional comments--- nope. :: N/a. :: Great course and great professor. I would take it again, provided it was in a different time slot. 8-9:20PM is just cruel. :: none. :: Sheng Li is a competent instructor and I would not hesitate to take another course with him."

472,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 4190,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Instructor did excellent job teaching students value concepts that can be applied in industry and used to develop complex approximations of lubrication theory. :: Really good at answering questions. :: Thank you for all of your help. :: I love how this class was taught. I like leaving a class with a notebook FULL of relative information and examples. Dr. Li utilized the white board and made every effort to give us all of the course note. It motivated me to come to class because I wanted to learn more about the subject. Very linear pace as far as the project was concerned. If you took good notes, payed attention, and went to each class and consulted in office hours, it was a good project that is understandable. :: Dr Li always gave examples related to real life applications and comparisons on how the theories of the subject were applied to the industry and what the industry expects from new graduates. :: He is a very motivative teacher, never degrades his students. Explains things very patiently which is one of the most important things I like. :: The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students. I like the way he took personal care of the problems arose from the individual students. :: Amazing faculty to have , Crystal clear explanation. :: Professor taught us  with good practical insight."
473,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 4190,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes, always available for office hours and explained hard concepts more than once. :: Yes. Was able to meet to help figure out projects at times. :: Yes. Dr. Li had plenty of questions asked to him during this semester and he answered each one and tried to make it applicable to the class. :: yes. when ever we had doubts in class he gave specific examples considering real life applications. :: Yes. :: Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept. :: Her showed us the lab and that helped me a lot to understand the practical application of the theory. :: Yes, With the project he helped me a lot in finishing it early."
474,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 4190,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Great professor, highly recommend. :: I liked the teaching style. So much learned about bearings and lubrication. For something that is overlooked most of the time, this was an excellent introduction to the process. :: Everything is good. :: It's all good"
475,Sheng Li,2017 Spring,ME 4190,Question 14,"Additional comments--- I liked how prepared Dr. Li was for the class. The notes say it all. Very detailed and helpful. Labeled well too. Anyone can make power points, but I was glad to see that I was not bored in class because the notes and pace forced me to pay attention and learn the material. :: The course was practical with projects which helped in learning unlike written exams where you don't really learn anything. :: Overall a good experience. :: This is not regarding the Professor. Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly. This will benefit every one who is interest but kind of feel tough to grasp the teachings."
476,James Menart,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- N/A - Not in this course. :: I do not have this class. :: I finished this course along time ago, but from what I hear he is somehow a good and understanding professor. :: took this 4 semesters ago, dont know why i got tagged to respond to your teaching now. but when i did take it, you sucked. :: great. :: didn't take this class. :: I was not in this class, but I was sent an evaluation. :: I don't have this class. :: /. :: I did not have this class this semester.  I had system dynamics with Hamed Attariani. Overall he was not an effective professor.  I didn't really learn anything new  if this was on an scale of 1 to 10 and 10 being the best class ever.  I would give this class and the instructor an 3. :: I AM NOT IN THIS CLASS. :: I am not enrolled in this class, Pilot sent this to me as a mistake. :: not my instructor. :: I was not in thermodynamics this semester. :: I wasn't in this class, I was in system Dynamics. :: a. :: I have never taken this class with this professor. :: Dr. Menart was a very effective teacher.  The approaches he took were very clear to us students and easy to follow.  Some people complain that they feel like they know what they're doing until test time and then find they don't.  I think this isn't fair, because he provides numerous examples in-class, including problems just like the ones he puts in exams, so really he does a lot to prepare us for the tests.  He also provides prctical applications to prepare us for the real world, which I find helpful"
477,James Menart,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- N/A - Not in this course. :: took this 4 semesters ago, dont know why i got tagged to respond to your teaching now. but when i did take it, you sucked. :: didn't take this class. :: I don't have this class. :: /. :: No, the grading was completely random.

The class was a waste of time and money.  But nothing will change so I don't understand the point of these surveys. :: I was not in thermodynamics this semester. :: I wasn't in this class. :: Dr. Menart was a teacher who challenged us to think, and who provided a lot of real-life examples so we could start applying what we were learning in class to real-life systems such as jet engines."

484,James Menart,2018 Spring,ME 4560,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Menart was very efficient at relaying course information and material. His homework and testing methods were fair in that they were challenging, however, the material was covered thoroughly in lecture. :: Very good and very knowledgeable. :: Dr. Menart essentially had 3 different sources of material for this class, each providing a different way to study. :: Dr. Menart is a very involved instructor who seems to genuinely care about the quality of his students' education. The course, however, is perhaps too broad in scope for a one semester course. :: Very knowledgeable and good at explaining the subject. :: good. :: Very good. :: Dr. Menart is very passionate about this subject and overall does a good job teaching it. I do feel as though I have learned the material presented in this course. :: Very effective. Descriptive in class, provides on screen digital notes (not standing in front of his own notes like when doing whiteboard stuff), and records his lectures, which is super helpful when studying for exams/homework. :: moderately effective. :: has a positive and comprehensive style- very encouraging about a subject he is clearly exited about. :: Dr. Menart was pretty effective. The lecture could get a little dry with just so many equations, but that was due to the material. :: Very effective. :: The course gives a good overview of wind power problematic. :: Very effective. Lots of information transmitted very clearly. :: good. :: explains clearly is well prepared  uses wit and humor effectively is a good public speaker (see Speaking at the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking) knows whether or not the class is following the material and is sensitive to studentsâ motivation is concerned about the quality of his/her teaching. :: Very much effective. :: Great!

If he made a mistake he would email out the correction. :: Excellent. :: very clear in classroom. :: He is very effective at communicating. Recording the lectures also helps. :: Very effective. :: Sometimes there are errors in the formulas given in the presentations. This makes it very confusing and a little anoying. You have to crosscheck the formulas of the script, which is unfortunately not very well organized. A improvement in this case would be very welcomed. :: Dr. Menart communicates well. He knows his subject and knows how to explain it. :: Very much effective.

Sometimes the computer notes get a little messy and disorganized, but you can still make it work. :: Dr. Menart's notes he uploaded were very well organized, as well as the lectures. However, trying to find some note from the lecture could be confusing with all the scribbled out parts, unless you re-watched the video up to that point. :: It was very nice having the lectures online to look back over material but jumps around what he is talking about. :: yes. :: Very, but the lectures could allow more time for the students to write notes. Sometimes the notes were gone from the projector before I finished writing them down. :: The course content was well organized, the only complaint I have is sometimes he would deviate from his notes in class. By doing this, a lot of the times he would make small errors in equations which can lead to confusing exchanges during class. :: Very well organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: The lectures are extremely organized. Everything is preplanned. :: Yes, he always knew what he was supposed to be teaching. :: Overall the covered content formed a good picture about the problematics of windpower. :: Course content and lectures are well organized.

It was a little hard to get into though because I wasn't too interested in the topic, but because that was the only course available that fit with my schedule I had to take it. :: He is a very nice professor who knows the material and cares about his students. :: no. :: My only suggestion is to control test time better. Allowing tests to routinely run overtime is a bad practice, especially for students who may have classes or other obligations stacked up following the test. :: has a thorough command of the field contrasts the implications of various theories gives the student a sense of the field, its past, present, and future directions, the origins of ideas and concepts  presents facts and concepts from related fields discusses viewpoints other than his/her own Dynamism and Enthusiasm is an energetic, dynamic person seems to enjoy teaching conveys a love of the field has an aura of self-confidence is perceived as fair, especially in his/her methods of evaluation  is seen by students as approachable and a valuable source of advice even on matters not directly related to the course. :: I wish i can take more subjects under him because he always makes things easy for me. :: no"

Problem is, many parts of the lab has changed and the manuals haven't been updated, meaning lots of questions had to be asked to make sure the test was done correctly. :: Would appreciate faster grading"
500,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Great teacher. :: Henry Young is a great man and great professor. very knowledgeable about the material being taught. though the exams were a little tough I felt challenged and enjoyed every minute of class time. Dr. Young isn't the man the people want, he's the man the people need. :: Very good. Enjoyed his teaching. :: yes. :: great. :: Fairly Effective. :: great. :: Dr Young made a somewhat dry topic very interesting. He constantly used real life examples that made the material relatable to engineering applications. :: during Material selection, the derivations to find the material equations was very confusing. By just doing the same 'light strong tie rod' 10 times, does not show me how to find an equation for another type of shape or component. For example, the quiz made us find something that was cheap, we never used cost as a factor in any of the problems worked out in class. :: Highly effective. Dr. Young knows the material well that he teaches, And presents it in an interest-keeping manner that makes it easy to learn the concepts. :: Fairly effective. It was a little difficult to pin down what was going to be on exams. Some of the material on the exams felt like it hadn't been covered completely in class. Overall the lectures were enjoyable to listen to. He really seemed to enjoy teaching. :: Great. :: Effectiveness of the professor was good. Very attentive, started class on time and worked well with students on due dates and lectures material. :: Explained the subject of the course clearly, homework reinforced concepts taught in class, and posted grades in a timely manner. :: Great!

502,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Very much so. :: He did use the entire class period for most of the year. It was just that pesky clock that kept changing. I blame the school for the handful of minutes I missed because the clock in our class room was never correct. im sure Dr. Young would agree. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Within reason, yes. :: yes. :: yest. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Class started on time and the full class period was used. :: Yes. :: Always. :: Yes. :: always on time"

Many time I was confused during Material selection but did not know how to ask a question for clarificiation. :: Dr. Young conducted the class in a flexible manner that allowed the students to fully understand a topic. He spent extra time on areas the students struggled with, and did not linger on topics that we understood quickly. :: He asked for feedback on what topics we were more comfortable with and went over topics that we knew less about. :: Yes a lot. :: Instructor asked questions and kept us interested during class lectures. :: Available for questions after class. :: Yes always willing to help. :: Explained everything in detail. :: he helped a lot and was always opened to questions."
504,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: given that I am not the materials engineer some of the other students are, Dr. young made sure that everyone had a tight grasp on the material being presented. I can confidently say that this was one course where I learned a plethora of material. :: Great. :: great. :: Instructor was very receptive and helpful in communications. :: very good. :: very good. always available via email and office hours. I went to office hours regularly as he is also my capstone adviser. :: good. :: Lectures were engaging and interesting, and he was readily available via email and office hours. :: He was pretty effective. He contacted through email and announcements and everything was pretty clear. :: Great, always has done well as this. :: Communicated well in and out of class through email. Always let us know about assignment due dates and exam dates. :: Replied promptly to e-mails. :: Just fine. :: I havenât met him out of classroom but in class he is good. :: very well"
505,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Very much so. :: uh yeah. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I think the material was organized, but it mat be helpful to know what material you want to cover in a particular class period. A lot of time was wasted deciding what material to lecture on. This would streamline the class and allow you to cover more material. :: ye. :: yes. :: The project should have been announced/ released soon after spring break. 1 week is really not enough time to do everything for a report on top of all other projects and exams from other classes.  The syllabus was very ambitious and throughout the semester, it seems we missed a far amount of material due to spending extra days on repeated material. :: yes. :: The lectures were fairly organized. Sometimes he would get off on a tangent, but that was interesting to listen to as well. :: Yes, first few lectures were tough but he changed up how he was teaching to help all students. :: Well organized lectures and course content was understood. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Lectures should have been more organized. :: yes"
506,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Very much so. :: it was almost like he had telepathic powers. he replied to emails within hours of sending them and was always available via email or after class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: was available when needed, very slow with email responses. :: yes. :: He was available when we needed to talk to him. :: Yes. :: Yes the instructor was always available and if he could not make an office hour he was very flexible when it came to appointments. :: Yes. :: Not applicable. :: Yes. :: always"
507,Henry Young,2018 Spring,ME 4740,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Get this man a cape. :: Awesome guy. :: I thoroughly enjoyed this class. :: no. :: Dr Young is one of the best professors in the engineering dept. He is always excited about his class and was always interested in how our capstone project was going (and happy to help). The university could use more teachers of his caliber. :: Great professor. :: Dr. Young is my favorite instructor. Regardless of which course I take with him, he has always made it interesting. While the material he teaches is not always easy, he provides the understanding and tools necessary for the students to learn the material. :: Overall an enjoyable class and teacher. :: No thanks for a great class Dr. Young. :: I appreciate his enthusiasm!. :: No. :: he is very good teacher with very good way of teaching methods."
508,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He goes over all of the material, but I feel like the notes could be more organized. I feel like the basics of each problem (like reasons for each assumption) could be stated more clearly in lecture. He assumes a lot of prior knowledge. :: very effective. :: He was very effective. He made his point clearly and made it fun to learn. His exams were VERY difficult, but overall, he was a great professor. :: class followed syllabus given at beginning. :: Dr. Wolff really pushes his students, and I like that. Thermodynamics isn't a subject you can just learn leisurely. This was one of the first classes here that really pushed me to learn and I'm so grateful for that. :: Professor Wolff was effective in this course, and exhibited a great knowledge of the course material. :: He was very effective at getting all the information across, and making sure to do practice problems with us. :: Dr. Wolff was a very effective instructor. He used the entirety of class time given to him and he covered topics that would help us prepare for our future. :: Dr. Wolff is a very interesting professor. He is very knowledgeable in the field of Thermodynamics and loves to teach it, but he sometimes skips steps that he expects students to know when we are taking this class for the very first time. I have learned a lot in this class, but unfortunately I may need to be re-taking this class next semester due to how much the exams are weighted in the class and that they are sometimes are to try and complete in the time given during our class period. :: Dr Wolff was an adequate instructor. Seemed very knowledgeable. :: assumed we already knew the content of the course and how to do the math. :: Dr. Wolff is one of the most effective instructors I have ever had. He works through many difficult example problems during class which is very helpful. :: 1. :: Very good. :: Dr. Wolff is a great professor in my opinion. The materials for the class is quite new and difficult for me at first. But Dr. Wolff has assigned the textbook chapters to read for class materials, that really helps. His class is hard, however, that is a huge motivation for me to work harder to really understand the subject. I have learned a lot throughout this semester. Thank you Dr. Wolff. :: He read from the book but if you asked a question he would answer the question"
509,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Word for word. :: Yes, we did everything that was in the syllabus as planned. :: Yes he did, he was very effective at sticking to the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Everything was laid out in the syllabus that was expected in class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, there were no surprises with the grading. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: he told us what he expected from us"
510,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: I'm not sure even one minute was wasted all semester!. :: Always. :: Yes, every single time. :: Always. :: Yes. Class always started on time and went to the very end. :: yes. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time and every minute of the lecture was filled with learning. There wasn't any wasted time. :: Yes. :: Yes, always. :: yes. he used every minute."
511,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He really wants everyone to know the basics of thermo. :: made jokes, used real world applications. :: He was always willing to answer questions and meet during office hours. :: offered office hours but he moved through in-class problems quite fast, didn't work through all the steps to make sure students knew what they were doing. :: Dr. Wolff has a passion for Thermo and engineering in general. He always talks about the applications of Thermo in industry and research. He was also ready to answer questions in class and is totally invested in his Thermo students. :: Explaining applications of what we were learning, which definitely sparked my interest. He also explained fields of study that we could go into to do more things like what we were doing in class. :: He really emphasized the idea of making us critically think, and understand the concepts presented. :: Yes. He often would mention examples intended to inspire students. :: He showed interest by always being available outside of class. :: Gave good lectures with many example problems. :: giving quizzes he wouldn't teach us how to do and wouldn't explain them afterwards half the time. :: Dr. Wolff clearly cares that we understand the material to prepare us to work as engineers. He makes sure to challenge us and tests our ability to think rather than perform cookie-cutter calculations based on memory. He even adds additional information into lecture that he does not have to cover within the class such as jet engines and diesel cycles. :: Yes. :: he tried to relate to real world application"
512,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Well. All of the assignments and exam dates are clearly known. :: very effectively. :: Very well. :: fast communication, short answers. :: Was always thorough with announcements. I never missed anything due to miscommunication. :: Very well. Response time was quick, and any changes were accompanied by a heads up email. I am very happy. :: very effective at letting us know any changes he made. :: Dr. Wolff was very effective in his communication. :: He did by always letting us know what was due. He would email us and tell us in class if there was ever an issue that came up. :: Communication was very effective. :: well enough. :: He communicates all necessary information via email and also reminds us during class. :: Yes. :: Dr. Wolff is always available to meet after and/or at his office hours. :: he emailed us if he added something to pilot. very effective"
513,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I think they could be organized better. Notes seemed jumbled to me, I think more example problems would be useful. Maybe explain things while using an example? I just think the solutions we go over could be better organized. It might have just been because of the classroom we were in, the board was awkward. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yeah. :: 100%. Absolutely. :: Yes, always. :: yes. :: Very well. you could tell that he has taught the material before and that he spent a lot of time preparing his notes. :: Yes, besides the fact that I think some material that was left out of lectures should have been talked about in class and other subjects that were went over should have been left out due to how much time we have in a semester. :: yes content was very organized. :: yes. :: They were very well organized. He always taught from notes he made prior to class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: he prepared the lectures well"
514,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: Always, he was very good at this and extremely understanding. :: yes he was. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes the instructor was available. :: yes. :: I never went to his office hours, but he was always willing to talk after class. I only emailed him once regarding a few points the grader mistakenly took off on a homework assignment. He never responded to this email, but I didn't really care since those points meant basically nothing for my final grade. I'm sure if it was something important he would have responded. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he answered my emails in a timely manner."
515,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Difficult test. Lots of time required for studying for exams. :: no. :: Nope!. :: teaches this INTRO class like a graduate level class.  these students are full time students with plenty of other classes. 12 hours a week of studying outside of the classroom for this ONE class is totally unrealistic when you take into account the 18 credit hours we are taking, in addition to the 30+ hours a week we work in order to pay for our tuition not to mention the other classes we are taking which also require outside studying.. :: Dr. Wolff is by far my favorite engineering professor simply because he pushes us so much!! I would take any of his classes in a heartbeat. @WSU PLEASE let him teach fluid dynamics..PLEASE. :: He's a fantastic teacher, and a brilliant guy, but thermodynamics is still really really difficult. :: I appreciate Dr. Wolff's style of teaching and general attitude toward the material. He seemed to enjoy his job and encouraged students to learn more whenever they could. He is one of the best instructors I have ever had. :: Dr. Wolff definitely sparked an interest in my mind when talking about Thermo. :: Class was very exam heavy. This made excelling in this class very difficult. :: poorest instructor I've ever had. Does not know how to teach students. :: I won't fill out the superfluous questions above; instead I will comment on the general efficacy of the professor. Dr. Wolff is a great guy. He really knows the material and does an excellent job of explaining concepts. I was recently hired as an intern for WPAFB. Because of Dr. Wolff, my boss thinks I am some kind of thermodynamic deity. At the end of the day I learned a lot and will be able to breeze through thermodynamics two. IMHO, let Dr. Wolff teach whatever course he wants to teach, as doing so will only benefit us (the students). :: The material is hard and tests were difficult but overall the teaching was effective and Dr. Wolff did a good job. :: I didn't have enough time for any test to finish it. i felt rushed. and i felt as though that affected my test scores."
516,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- yes. :: He's somewhat effective. Talking to students who have taken the class previously, the subject matter can be difficult to grasp/follow in general, so I'm hesitant to comment on his effectiveness. It seems like he's probably doing a good job given the material. :: a. :: This instructor was effective. His lessons flowed and he did a good job of explaining the material. The material was difficult for me to understand, but I feel that it was taught pretty well. :: Quite effective. Good explanations and examples."
517,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, evaluations were fair and the criteria was justified."
518,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes.
519,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He regularly asked questions in class to see what we understood. Most of the time the class was quiet. I'm not sure anyone really ""gets"" what he's asking when he asks it. :: We had a one on one discussion after class one day that expressed his interest in me as a student. :: Dr. Wolff always makes time for questions about homework problems at the start of class and reviews exams very thoroughly. Always tries to keep everyone engaged through active discussion throughout the lecture."
520,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He communicated very effectively. :: Good. :: Very effectively.
521,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part. Dr. Wolff has a habit of jumping around topics - rather than cover one topic completely in one lecture, it will be covered partially throughout a series of lectures with other topics. This seems to just be his style, and it not overtly confusing."
522,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, always answered questions during office hours thoroughly."
523,J. Wolff,2018 Spring,ME 4330,Question 8,0
524,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Overall he gets the main points of the class. He is extremely nice and does an decent job. :: Was very good at the beginning of the semester but as time went of he became rushed and did not do a very good job. :: good. :: Great teacher. Does a great job explainable the material at hand. :: I learned a lot from this course/instructor. This just happens to be a class where you have to put in extra effort outside of class to catch on to the concepts. It helps to watch videos over YouTube. :: Very confusing while teaching in class.  Rarely gives decisive answers or explains exactly why answers become what they are. :: He was effective. Went through many examples in class. :: Classes werenât very effective learned more reading the book than going to class. :: Not very effective, I did not learn a lot from this professor. He didn't seem like he knew the material very well himself, and would even teach equations incorrectly. He didn't seem very prepared for class, and the examples he did do he didn't have worked out and would stop working on them. :: Teaching was unorganized and learning objectives were not specifically followed. :: effective. :: Terrible instructor.   Very unorganized, not good and explaining the material, constantly gave in class quizzes without giving students enough time to complete.  Examples are never completed, professor goes over them quickly and never completes them, just goes over theory of how to complete them. :: he instructs very well and gives a lot of examples. :: he was very friendly. as a teacher he was not effective. :: 8/10 effective. :: Best Professor in Mechanical Engineering Department."
525,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: good. :: Yes. All expectations were clearly described before the course began. :: We were evaluated by what was written in the syllabus. :: Not entirely.  Some work was assigned and graded differently than stated throughout the semester. :: Yes. :: Kinda not really. :: NO HE DID NOT. My fellow classmates as well as myself discovered that he and his grader are using the incorrect grading key for our homework, meaning that all of our homework problems are graded incorrectly and we are losing points for no apparent reasons. Also, on one of my online quizzes, I received a zero, and went into his office to talk about what I did wrong. I was confident in my answer, and went in there to talk with him.  the question was multiple choice, and the solution I got was the correct answer, however, he said that he worded the question wrong, and that wasn't what he was looking for. I asked him how this was okay that I receive a zero on the quiz when my solution was in fact correct and a provided answer, but I received no points for it just because he worded the question incorrectly. He dismissed it and said it was on me that I didn't give the answer he was looking for, even through the answer I provided was correct. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes he did. :: he tested us on things we quickly went over. :: yes. :: Yes, he did."
526,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes he did a very good job at this. :: good. :: Yes. Professor main always  taught until the class was over. :: Yes..he would use every minute he could with our class. Even on the last day of class when everything was covered, he still asked us if we had any questions over any concept throughout the entire semester. When no one had a question, he went over material of what he thought students would need a little more practice in from the experience of semesters past. :: For the most part yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always. :: he started class on time. :: yes. :: Yes, he did."
527,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes, he really wants everyone to understand. But he has a hard time expressing what he is trying to say. :: good. :: Professor Mian was constantly checking if we had any questions and if we were really understanding the subject. :: He demonstrated interest in our learning by asking us if we had any questions throughout the lecture. IF we needed help with the homework, he would try to walk us through the problem at the beginning of class. :: He always accepted questions although he never really answered the thouroghly. :: He always stopped to answer questions if students were confused. :: Talked to us. :: He showed no interest in our learning whatsoever. I went into his office to ask questions and understand the material better, and while I was leaving he told the me that the material was simple, and that I should be understanding this. But then proceeded to say if i needed help to stop by. Despite his degrading remark towards me, I still visited his office hours, but each time I went it appeared that I was a bother and taking up his time, or he would act annoyed while I was there. On one occasion, I emailed him to let him know I was going to be stopping by to ask questions on some of the material, and when I got there he was helping another student. Once the other student left he was getting his stuff together to leave and I asked him where he was going and he said that he was leaving to go somewhere. I asked him if he got my email and if we could still meet as planned, and his response was he supposed so, and then proceeded to teach me a days worth of material which is around 55 minutes in 10 minutes. :: He would ask for class participation but did not often receive much feedback. :: Wanted to see more involvement and class participation. :: Professor was nice and did seem to care if we learned however he was not good at teaching and was constantly not prepared for class and unorganized. :: he let us ask questions. :: he did. he told us to come to office hours if we need help and he answered every question we had in class. :: Dr. Mian would always provide examples and promote class interaction as to engage with students. :: Yes, he did."
528,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did pretty well. :: ehhh, kind of rough. :: good. :: Very effective in communication. Used pilot and email very often. :: Communication outside of class was great. He welcomed us to office hours from the first day of the semester. Communication inside the classroom was okay for the most part. He would say something about and assignment one day (such as the layout of the assignment, or what it's going to cover), and he will say something a little different about it a few classes later. :: Poorly. It seemed like there was confusion every week. :: Communicated well. :: Forgot sometimes and we had to remind him. :: Not very effectively, if we emailed him with questions we would typically get one worded responses or no response at all. It was hard to ask questions in class because he would change his mind on what he would say. For example, when asking him about the material for the final, he said it was only going to be the last 3-4 chapters we have learned. However, this past week he put out a syllabus for the final, and it is now 6 chapters. While this is better than a cumulative final, he still went against his word. :: Not very well out of the classroom, and average in the classroom. :: effectively enough, occasionally unclear. :: Very poorly. :: very effectively. :: very effective. :: Dr. Mian would sometimes be a little confusing to start but would always make sure to alleviate any confusion still in the class. :: By many ways like emails , Pilot, appointments, office hours  and in-class announcements .. I asked him many questions inside and outside the class, and he was welcome and happy to help."
529,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Kinda. He is trying to make everyone understand so he went a little slow. :: no. they felt very pieced together and like he did not know what he was doing. :: good. :: Yes they were. Taught very applicable material. :: Content and lectures were organized. I feel as though we kind of lagged behind in material when we reached the midterm. After the midterm, we had to catch up so the second part of the semester was more fast-paced. :: No. It may have been organized for the first couple weeks. after that it became mayhem. :: Yes. :: Kinda. :: No, as I mentioned he rushed through material, did not have example problems worked out himself, and would give us incorrect equations and formulas to use for problems. :: Not at all. :: This would be the area that needs improvement. lectures weren't very organized and his class notes seemed a little scatter brained. :: No not at all. :: yes. :: they were not organized. :: yes. :: Yes, they were."
530,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: good. :: Always willing to answer students questions and always readily available. :: I didn't need to contact him online, but he was available during office hours. :: Yes. if there was a problem (which there were plenty) he always had a timely response. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Somewhat, see the response on the interest in learning for my explanation in how he reacted to meeting in office hours/appointments. In short, it was not beneficial to go to him during office hours or even try to communicate with him as he showed no interest in helping as well as would be annoyed when asking questions. :: I did not attend office hours, but he was available on email readily. :: always available. :: Yes. :: yes. :: he was available whenever i needed him. :: yes. :: Yes, he was."
531,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The only suggestion I have for professor Mian is that he would do more actual book examples during class. A lot of the material was conceptual, were is beneficial, but didn't help much for the quizzes and exams. :: Become more organized and do more relevant examples in class. :: Overall, not a good professor. Seems like a nice guy, but is a very poor instructor. Teaches the material in too difficult of a manner to understand, shows no interest in aiding the students, provides incorrect equations to solve the problems, USES THE WRONG GRADING KEY FOR OUR HOMEWORK, grades quizzes on an unfair basis, communicates poorly with students, and doesn't teach well. :: Going over problems that are similar to the homework assigned would be beneficial, and reviewing past quizzes would be very helpful. :: overall good instructor, really cares if you learn and wants to help, definitely needs to work on organizing his lectures and notes. sometimes I didn't know what to write. :: nope. :: N/a. :: nope. :: Thanks a lot Dr. Mian you are the best."
532,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Instructor was new to course but flexible in his expectations of students. I think a more practical approach to teaching this course would be more effective, as I don't think we got a full understanding of how to apply these teachings to the real world applications. :: good. :: In class examples are not very clear. It would be nice if steps were explained rather than glossed over. :: I had Dr. Mian for system dynamics which he taught similar to this class. I feel there was little differentiation between the courses for a large part of the semester. :: Professor was reasonably effective. :: Dr. Mian was effective in teaching the material of this course. :: Could be better, sometimes the lectures seemed to be disorganized and hard to follow. But overall effective in learning. :: Good. :: Dr. Mian covers all the material that he tests us over on exams as well as material he feels with be useful to us in the workplace. :: good. :: Not that effective. His examples in class are not done previously to insure a steady explanation. :: He comes to class unprepared every day. It seems as if he is just stalling until the end of class. It did not appear that he understood the material because he refused to work through examples. We take frequent breaks and he will just randomly walk out of class at times. The lab TA and professor had different requirements for the labs, so it was unclear what we were expected to do. The only thing he covered in this class was Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues, which was a review from Diff Eq and linear algebra. I have not taken anything away from this course and am unclear what we should have learned. I expressed my concern about the quality of the course to the professor and to Heather Casto of the ME department. I was told that if I did not like the quality of a course that I should go to a different university. My experience with this course has been very frustrating and feels like a waste of time and money. If anyone would like to discuss this further I would be happy to provide more feedback. You can contact me at ravencraft.2@wright.edu, Taylor Ravencraft. :: Relatively speaking, Dr. Mian is a very kind and forgiving instructor that is lenient when it comes to grading. To be completely honest, his class sessions were insightful and he did cover example problems that would directly correlate with the homework and exams for the course. However, I would say that the effectiveness of his instructing was minimal. The majority of the instruction did come directly from the course literature, but being someone who is capable of going through the book on my own time, the effectiveness of what he taught in class was kind of ""lagging"". What may have taken him a few weeks to cover in class could take me a few hours to understand on my own. :: decent. :: He is a very nice person and is understanding unlike most engineering professors. His lectures are not the best but they are also what you put into them you get out of the class. :: very good. :: Instructor was very effective in teaching skills needed to succeed in the class. :: Great guy but explanations in class were unclear. :: not very effective. :: Teaching is good.  easily understandable."
533,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: All sections in the syllabus were covered. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No, the lab TA and professor had two different sets of expectations for labs. The TA wanted us to solve for mode shapes throughout the semester, but we were not told what mode shapes were until 2 weeks before the end of the semester. :: Yes, he did follow the course syllabus quite well in regards to expectations and performance toward the final grade of the course. A few variables were made, though many courses do change the terms along the length of the semester. The main structure of the course though did not change at all. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, syllabus was followed and clearly defined. :: Yes. :: yes. he did evaluate my work based upon syllabus."
534,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yep. :: Yes, although he would switch between using the board, elmo, and smart pen. :: Yes. :: Yes. Would always cover as much material as possible every class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No, the professor was late some days, or he would create small talk at the beginning of the class to avoid covering any material. Like I stated previously he would take frequent brakes, and leave the classroom at times. :: Yes, I do not believe he ended the course early/cancelled any of his classes except for the occasional ""early dismissal"" based on the information that was being taught. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, class always started on time and went until it end. :: Always. :: yes. :: yes. he is punctual and sincere in teaching."
535,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Did a great job of keeping student attention, but course seemed more theoretical than applicable to the real world. :: yes. :: Sorta. Whenever there were questions and uncertainties brought up he would try and make things clearer. :: Dr. Mian cared that students were learning the process to solve problems and not just spitting out answers. :: Solved through quite a few examples. :: Dr. Mian would often pause the class for a moment to see if everyone had a good understanding of the material. :: .. :: He did. :: Dr. Mian would make sure we understood a concept before moving on to the next topic. He also encouraged us to meet with him during his office hours for help in his class. :: yes very much so. :: He did not have any interest in my learning. He often talked about non-related topics. He once went on a tangent about nanotechnology. I asked if that was going to be covered on the exam, he replied not, but that he felt it was an important topic and wanted to discuss it. We never covered any related material that day, or most days. :: He always greeted the class with cheer and would give commonplace examples that matched the information being taught (on an occasional basis). He was also open to answering any questions as they arose during the class time. :: lecture. :: Its vibrations not really sure how you would do that. :: yes. :: By providing real-world examples such as the day we went over vibration isolation techniques for various applications. :: Always willing to set aside time to help studenTs and even extend office hours. :: method of teaching is primary mode which i gained interest on the subject."
536,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Held regular office hours and communicated with class via email. :: good. :: Emails were sometimes too broad. :: Dr. Mian would announce changes to the syllabus or plans in class. If something changed outside of class he would send out an email as soon as he could. :: Reasonably well. :: Very effectively. Dr. Mian was always open to students e-mailing him and meeting him if they had any questions. :: Well. :: Well. :: Dr. Mian regularly emailed us and used Pilot to keep a steady line of communication. :: good. :: He was very unprepared and most days was not able to communicate course material at all. :: Plenty of direct communication, was always available in and out of his office hours, and would send emails regularly if there was additional information posted on pilot or requirements set by the class. :: well. :: yeah he was in his office whenever you needed help. :: very good. :: Communicated well by the use of email and pilot. :: Explanations unclear and confused. Made a lot of math errors in examples which made it hard to follow. :: Kept referring back to system dynamics. such as, ""Remember? We did this in System Dynamics."" But I did not take system dynamics with him or last semester like most of the students so I didn't know what he was talking about. And if we went over all of the same stuff in system dynamics what is the point of making a separate class named vibrations. :: he will clarify the doubts we had in class and out of class.. no matter what time is it."
537,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: He was sporadic in class, often jumping from subject to subject with no warning. :: Yes, they typically followed a section per class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Could use more organization during lectures, sometimes are hard to follow. :: Mostly. :: Yes. :: yes. :: It was not well organized. His notes were kind of all over the place. :: No, most days he would write the same formula on the board over and over. He would reference example problems and state that we were going to work through them, but we never did. He would change problems in class to make them ""easier to solve"" by changing the initial conditions to zero, and he was still not able to solve them. He never seemed to have a lesson plan in place. Most days he would come in and flip open the textbook and decide on the spot what we were going to discuss that day or he would put pre written notes on the projector and tell us he would post them to pilot so we could review them. :: The course content was well organized, though the lectures tended to be all over the place. For the most part, they followed the syllabus, though a lot of, what I consider to be un-useful information was given in the lectures for cases in which we never really applied in our homework assignments. :: somewhat. :: Refer to the first comment. :: yes. :: Yes, class time was always spent learning material and doing examples. :: Yes. :: Not always, the beginning of the course was rearranged to not follow the order of the book. He thought is was a better order to teach it, but I don't agree. :: yes. It is well oragnized."
538,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yep. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Mian is one of the best professors I have had when it comes to being available and responding quickly. :: yes. :: If I asked the instructor a question he would just tell me to ask the lab TA. He was never able to answer my questions. :: When needed, the instructor would make himself available to us for discussing information about the course. This was not a regular occurrence, though was performed when necessary. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes, always available for office hours. :: Always. :: yes."
539,Akm Mian,2018 Spring,ME 4210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Mian is one of the few professors who obviously cares more for the students learning than for getting passing grades. This was very refreshing from other classes where the professors are more interested in their research. :: No. :: nope. :: No. :: no. :: I dread taking future courses with Mian because I do not learn anything from him. He has very poor or no lesson plans. I am concerned that students are not learning from him. I am shocked that when I brought my concerns to Heather Casto that she told me to go to another school if I did not like the quality of the courses at Wright State. My experience with this course and Heather Casto has given me a very negative impression of Wright State, their ethics, and customer service. I will be sure to share this experience with anyone who asks me my opinion of Wright State and will suggest to potential students to go else where so they do not have a similar experience. :: I like this professor. He is kind and knowledgeable. However, I wish he made his courses more challenging. As a Master's student, I expect to be challenged in my courses (to build drive and motivation to learn each subject), though this class tended to be a ""cakewalk"". In future courses, I hope Dr. Mian continues to challenge his students at a higher level, either with additional homework or more thought-provoking exams. If possible, I'd like to see him go over a single section of the course notes in a fast manner, highlighting all of the practical equations (completely required), then jump directly into solutions for how each of the equations are applied and in what circumstances. :: Great guy and always willing to go above and beyond to help however he could. :: he is student-friendly and well communicative."
540,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was extremely effective in teaching and explaining the content. :: Very effective. :: Very effective.   Ensures that every student is not left behind if they will request her or the TA's assistance.   The material covered is as expected and is covered thoroughly. :: very effective, I learned a lot in the course. :: She was very effective in teaching concepts and demonstrating solid modelling. :: Knows her stuff and cares about students being engaged. I felt comfortable asking for help when I missed something and that is not something that can be said for all instructors. :: good. :: good. :: The instructor was very effective in that she would go over the required skills in class that we needed to complete out homework. :: I think she effectively taught the material needed, but did not go into depth on things that needed to be taught in more depth. She was very inconsistent with deadlines, and rushed through many things. I struggled to find time to do everything I needed to for my other classes while trying to complete her tasks at the same time. Some tasks did not even include necessary instructions. :: Very good. :: Very effective. :: She was an alright professor and taught the content somewhat well. :: Moderately effective, she moved very quickly during her lectures. The majority of the class fell behind on a consistent basis. :: very good. :: she is very good but she gives a lot of homework. :: She knew the material well and was very fluent with Solidworks."
541,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, the instructor evaluated very fairly, based on the expectations outlined. :: yes. :: Very fair in the evaluation of my work. Absolutely no complaints. :: yes. :: All work was graded as it was explained in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, but I think that she threw too many things in the class that I knew from talking to peers were not included in the course with other instructors. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, she did everything as she described in the syllabus. :: Yes, although evaluation of the homework seemed a little arbitrary. There was no firm rubric set in place for the design tasks. :: yes. :: Yes"
542,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes the instructor was very punctual and prompt. She even came to class early to answer any questions regarding the previous class material. :: yes. :: Instructor was early for every class that I attended. (I missed two due to illness) Used the full class period and was available before class  and after class for assistance. :: yes, although we were released early several times in the first couple of weeks since the software hadn't been installed on the classrooms computers. :: Class always started on time. Class time was split effectively between concept lecture, SolidWorks demonstations, and work time. :: Yes, also provided some lab time where you could ask for help on specific issues you are facing. This was very helpful for this class. Sometimes the issues you run into can not be explained by a text book. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always started on time and leaves some room at the end for open lab which is very useful to get help. :: Yes, she started on time every day, and sometimes she would let us out early if we completed the work. :: Yes, she always started on time and the class period was always utilized. :: yes. :: Yes"
543,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She made sure the activities were very engaging and hands-on. She also used more than one way of teaching - writing on the board, demonstrating and lecturing. :: Very simple, she asked. Looked at the work when asked. Provided a field trip to see additive manufacturing capabilities. Provided multiple videos covering the topic of interest for the particular subject covered during the class period. Provided outside references for those interested enough to pursue. :: Asking me about how i was doing in the course. :: She would answer questions, instruct individuals, send TAs to help, and would redemonstrate the SolidWorks tasks. :: Prof. Mirmasoudi really tried hard to relate the course content to how it would be applied in the real world. There was significant emphasis placed on the design process and its steps in creating a new product. :: She had TA's in the classroom that would help if anyone fell behind. She also set up tutoring hours for anyone that needed help. :: I do not think that she did. :: Yes. :: Made sure everyone understood things and kept up with her on the program. :: She gave us extra credit opportunities, and seemed to care about us. :: Yes, but more in a generic class room sense. :: The design tasks did that for us."
544,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The professor was extremely effective at communicating. :: Very definitive in explaining the class room topics. Very knowledgeable regarding Solidworks.  She knew her stuff. Would cover the process more than once if the students were having difficulty with the example or design task. :: Very, she emailed if there was any changes to any upcoming things. :: She explained things clearly and would make sure everyone could see what she was writing or demonstrating. Sometimes she went through topics quickly and it would be difficult to keep up. She and her TAs would also respond to emails quickly. :: Expectations were clearly defined and questions answered effectively. :: yes. :: Very effectively. :: Well enough to get through the class, however multiple due dates were changed the day of and we were not notified until class time when the task was due, which completely defeats the purpose of changing the deadline to help students. :: Good. :: Very well. Emails were sent if she didn't discuss something in class. She also sent reminder emails which are very helpful. :: She was pretty slow to reply to emails, but she did communicate effectively. :: Well, she always responded to emails and students' questions quickly. :: very well. :: Out of the classroom was difficult to get hold of her but the TA's were good at answering questions on her behalf quickly."
545,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course content was very well organized however the textbook was not very useful. :: yes. :: Outstanding.   Made the classroom exercises very effective due to the outstanding organization of material. :: Yes, although it was rushed since the computers didn't have solidworks for the first two weeks of the course. :: Classes were well organized and split effectively between topics and tasks. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: They were organized enough to get through the material necessary. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was very well organized. :: Yes and no, we progressed through the material at a good pace and she knew what she was doing for the day. However, there was no defined overview of what was going to be covered each class period. :: yes. :: Yes"
546,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor was always available and responsive. :: yes. :: The instructor was very available and very responsive before, during, after class as well as by e-mail and appointments. :: yes, she didn't have a physical office for office hours but replied to my emails with questions promptly. :: She did not have office hours, but she would respond to emails quickly and so did her TAs. The TAs were always available during their office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not really, there were only two office hours for the entire week whereas I have classes that provide 21 hours a week to accommodate more students. She had no office hours herself. :: Yes. :: Yes, normally replied within hours. :: Yes, she or her TAs were available in office hours sometimes, and responded to emails within 2 days. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I was not able to reach her out of class in a reasonable time the one time I needed an answer for an assignment due the next day.   However before class she was always available, and as long as I copied the TA's I got a timely answer."
547,Sara Mirmasoudi,2018 Spring,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Very good instructor.  The class is lucky to have someone as well organized, as knowledgeable, and interested in the students learning. :: no. :: Refreshing to see an instructor with real world experience and that has an obvious passion for ensuring that students are prepared for work in their career. That is not always the case. :: Instructor was very good overall. :: I do not recommend this instructor for anyone. She was very inconsistent with deadlines. Many things were rushed because she claimed the class was behind the other sections, while there are no other sections this semester. She also refers to teaching the class as her hobby, which I do not appreciate. My education is not a hobby. She also assigned two design tasks in one week multiple times, when they are supposed to be given a week apart. She also assigned a design task and made the due date the day before the cardboard chair project which is also not common practice. There were many small things that made this class much less fun than it should have been. :: No. :: No. :: She was an average professor, for a very interesting class. She kinda sucked the fun out of the class, and that was very disappointing, considering this was the only section offered for this course. :: The course text book needs to either be made an optional purchase, or integrated into course material more effectively. I did not use it at all during the entire semester."
548,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very reasonable professor. :: I believe Dr. S is a great instructor and is always responsive to emails and helpful during his office hours. He is legitimately interested in the topic which causes him to explain processes and real-world applications rather than just stick to the book. :: At the beginning of the semester, the instructor was very effective at relaying course information. However, the second half of the semester felt rushed which made the instructor less effective. :: good. :: the instructor was good and got his point across. good teacher but since it was his first semester teaching this course it was kinda rough. :: Not very effective. He assigned a total of 6 projects for the semester and waited till the last 2 weeks of classes to assign the last 4 of them. :: Dr. Srinivasan is knowledgeable and gives thorough derivations in class, but he does not teach optimally for the homework and exam requirements. The second exam had a class average of 44 / 100, but it was still followed up by an unprofessional email that seemed to claim that he had no role in the embarrassing scores. Overall then Dr. Srinivasan seems to need more hands on experience in order to successfully return to teaching the course. :: Not very effective, very little examples in class.  Which makes homework and exam content more difficult. :: Awful his lectures consisted of just deriving equations from the book. He is very unhelpful when answering questions, he will just restate the question. His exams and homework did not reflect what we went over in class. He did not follow his syllabus. :: somewhat effective but it would help if the information was presented more organized. :: He was an effective professor. Explained the material so we could comprehend it. :: We were supposed to cover chapters 1 through 17 in the book assigned for that class. We made it through chapter 1-7. We were supposed to receive 5 grades for 5 Finite Element Analysis projects. We will receive 2 grades for only performing 2 of these projects. (15% of the total grade) We were supposed to complete 4 data analysis assignments. We did 2. (15% of the total grade). The average of the second of the two midterms was a 44%. A homework assignment was given a couple days prior to the exam covering the material we expected to see on the exam. No class examples were worked for 3 straight weeks regarding the material for this second exam. As I write this, a retake for the second exam will be given today. No additional lecture was given regarding the material covering this make up exam (which the majority of the class seems to not understand based on the test average). The syllabus was modified with the parenthetical ""tentative"" after all the due dates and class expectations. I'm in zero control of my grade for this class. :: Pretty good at teaching what he teaches in class, is very thorough.   However, there has been a disconnect between the material taught, the homework, and the exam problems - at least on exam 2.  The homework did not prepare us for the second exam by a long shot, and that is reflected in the grades on exam 2.  That is not to say the professor is ineffective at teaching, I - and many other students - feel that the work asked of us did not reflect the difficulty of that exam. :: Dr. Srinivasan is professional and knows metal forming very well. His teaching was adequate. :: He was effective in showing us the theory behind many things and the labs in the course were fantastic. There were almost no worked through examples though and most of the class agreed that that is the best way to learn and how to perform well in the course. :: okay... :: This instructor did not help me to understand the material at all.  Lectures were focused on theory and how to derive the equations but did not help me to do homework problems, exam problems, or understand how to apply the equations to the labs. :: Was not effective at communicating content or student responsibilities throughout the semester. The lecture notes were all numbers with no context. We would spend the entire class learning derivations and go over very few examples to problems that we would be tested over. More often than not, if we did get examples they were given the last day before the exam. I do not feel like I was able to retain any of the information taught in this class because there were no clearly defined concepts for students to study and practice. :: I enjoy Dr. Srinivasan as a professor, but I don't feel like I learn as much from him as I could. He spends a disproportionate amount of time on the minutiae of the concept, but tests on aplpication, with little practice in relating the two. :: Fairly effective. It was a bit difficult to get the concepts that we were supposed to be gleaning. I tend to learn a bit better with textbooks, however, and the textbook was very unintuitive to go through. :: This instructor was not very effective. He did so many notes in class, but he did not do hardly any examples. It was hard for the students to understand and apply the learned material to use on specific problems. :: good. :: He did a good job of explaining things in a way that we could understand and find interesting."
549,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Please do not forget about labs and then jam them into the last two weeks. It is unfair to expect that out of students. We are already working on all of our final projects for other classes, and we are people. We do need peace of mind that we know what is due and when. To be thrown more out of what feels like nowhere is extremely stressful and counter-intuitive to learning. I respectfully ask that the professor re-evaluate what needs to be done in this course and change the syllabus. We do not need to do that many simulation projects in order to understand the software or what is happening when an object deforms. It added so much unneeded stress when the software would not work, and it felt completely unnecessary. :: Yes, the evaluations seems to have stuck to the syllabus. My complaint is that I do not believe the initial homework were graded fairly. :: The second half of the semester I felt unprepared for. :: yes. :: kinda, his second exam was alittle harder and over material that we didnt  cover very well in class. Shouldnt have saved all the projects till the end,. :: Syllabus was unclear from the beginning. :: No the syllabus and pilot have contradicting grading information. :: No. :: kinda of, yeah. :: Yes. :: No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Not at all. Missing approximately 15% of the total grade in various project alone (since they were never assigned), I can only wonder what my grade in this class will be based on. Over the course of the semester, only 5 homework assignments were given. The student grader was consistently giving remarkably low scores on the class's homework. Homework, being 10% of the final grade, works out to be 2% of my total grade per assignment. The student grader was addressed about how he/she was grading the homework, at which point, homework was graded more leniently. Up until that point, there is about 5% of my total grade that I can't recover. In other words, it is my estimation that there is approximately 20% of the grade for this class that I simply have no control over. :: Yes, grades were as spot-on as the syllabus stated. :: The syllabus was clear however we did not make it through everything we needed to cover for the semester. :: yes. :: sure? the grader was super strict at the beginning, he did loosen up after we all complained but none of our grades were changed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He did. However, he did not give out any partial credit which seems a bit harsh for such a difficult class. :: YEs. :: good. :: Yes"
550,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, and yes. :: Always. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes always on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes, and often went late. :: yes, but sometimes class was over early which isnt always a problem, but I do feel as if sometimes we got out early the time could i have been spent covering more information. :: Yes. He used the class time efficiently and effectively. :: Yes. He held class consistently. Some classes were cancelled, but this was very seldom and a result of an injury he sustained. :: Yes, class rarely started late and almost never ended early.  Was always full of useful information. :: yes. :: felt like after spring break, the lectures dwindled off. the first few weeks were note heavy and lecture heavy. After spring break, the lectures became notes on the projector. When you wrote out the notes on the projector, they were easier to read and were centered in the room making them easier to see. The pre-written notes were not helpful, moved too quickly, couldn't take any good notes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he used the class time as scheduled. :: Yes. :: yes always. :: Yes"
551,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Had good notes to go off of, answered questions reasonably. :: Yes, see my first comments. :: Dr. Srinivasan was interested in our learning. He tried to be as helpful as he could be. :: yes. :: yes, was will to hlep outsaide of class and would reteach something if the class wasnt understanding it. :: He didn't often take interest in our learning. :: No, he teaches only to be teaching.  Seems to not care much about the students learning and cares about how his classes grades look. :: N/A he did not seem to care whether or not we understood the content. :: He gave a lot of real world applications and was available outside of office hours if needed. :: He would ask questions after certain material was taught to help us understand what was going on. :: Based on the class structure (or lack thereof), I can not be convinced he has an interest in my learning. I took the technical elective because I felt it would benefit me at my job to have some of the knowledge behind metal forming. I feel like the class became less about the subject and more about simply making it out of the class with a passing grade. :: Took class time to address certain problems or to hit on key points we missed in the homework assignments. :: Dr s demonstrated interest in our learning by doing labs and using the entire class time. :: didn't. only cared about getting his assignments complete and didn't care how much time we spent late into the night on these assignments and simulations. :: He assigned a significant amount of work for practice after he felt we had not grasped the concepts provided. :: He did seem to want us to learn the material and was responsive to feedback, but I just had difficulty with his teaching style. :: yes. :: He routinely asked if we had any questions, and waited several seconds for someone to ask a question."
552,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He was effective in communicating. :: He always responded to questions well either in class, via email, or during his office hours. He was eager to help me understand. :: Communication was great. :: good. :: did a good job of responding to emails and was always available during his office hours. :: He was never very clear on what he wanted us to do in class. :: Poorly, does not explain things.  When asking questions about clarification he brushes you off and says we will discuss later, which never happens. :: poor, he rarely responded to emails and was not in his office during office hours. :: you could usually get in contact with him but would it actually help you, it really depends on the topic being discussed I wouldnt recommend asking for help on homework but i would for the projects. :: I was able to meet with the professor multiple times outside of the class if I needed to ask questions. :: He sent emails out when things (like due dates and expectations for assignments) changed. Which was often. I suppose this is to say he communicated well. :: Professor was quick as a whip in answering emails. :: Dr S was easy to communicate with through email. He was not very clear in everything he wanted i.e. exam questions, lab reports. :: Very well. :: drags on and on about a topic then gets behind in the schedule and can never catch back up. :: Expectations for labs was unclear.  Only a couple days before the lab was due I still did not understand what we were expected to turn in. :: The instructor did not communicate clearly in the classroom. Myself and the majority of students that I spoke to out of class did not understand the concepts that were taught in class. Additionally, the book assigned was outdated, riddled with errors (both in text and in HW problems). It was difficult to take any of the information in the book and apply it to problems that were on the exam or HW. :: Prett yeffectively. :: He used emails effectively and when there were announcements in class they were clear. :: great, really good at communicating in class and via email!!!. :: He did a good job of explaining things and keeping us updated on tests and assignments."
553,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Timeline was off. This ended up with us covering no new material after the second exam and being fully saturated with a ton of lab work and FEA projects. :: At the beginning of the semester yes, however, the second half felt rushed. :: yes. :: yes, a few of the lectures were confusing but is expected in an engineering class. :: No. The class was very unorganized and coursework was not well balanced throughout the semester. :: yes for the sole reason he copied down equations from the book. :: not really, was never really sure what we were covering until it was covered. no real layout for what would be discussed or what chapter we were in the book. I came to class everyday and still had no idea what was going on most of the time. the projects were really rushed and not explained well. :: Yes. Class time was well spent and was organized. :: No. :: Yes, with one exception.  We were suppose to have 6 mini-projects scheduled throughout the semester, and we ended up having to cram a bunch of them into the last 3 weeks of school. :: yes. :: The syllabus schedule was very ambitious, didn't even get through half the material that was supposed to be covered. A month before the end of the semester, you said that since we hadn't done many of the labs that we wouldn't do the rest due to time limits. apparently you changed your mind and assigned everything in the last 3 weeks of class. This is not okay since we all have papers and exams for other classes. I guarantee that most people in your class are not only taking your class and most students are taking at least 12-15 credits this semester. Its hard to study for the make up exam and try to do all these reports on top of all my other classes. If you were to stick to the original schedule or keep us updated with an updated schedule, that would have been greatly appreciated. :: The labs could have been less stressful if they were distributed throughout the semester rather than all due together at the end of the semester.  The course content could have been better organized to align with the labs to be performed throughout the semester. :: Organized but unclear. :: yes. :: I think the organization could use a bit of work. :: They needed more examples but the actual lecture material wasn't bad. :: yes. :: Yes, although we were forced to deviate from the schedule so much that most of the projects ended up being concentrated in the last few weeks of the semester."
554,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No he was slow to respond to any email if at all, he would meet outside of office hours if you made an appointment. :: yes always available but not always helpful. :: Yes. If I needed to ask a question outside of class, I could set up a time to meet with him in his office. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes and he also helped outside of office hours if needed. :: sometimes, The saying 'we will take about it' really is not a good answer for students who need to plan things. :: Responsive through email. :: yes. :: He is always interesting to talk to and responsive to needs discussed. :: yes. :: Yes"
555,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Spring,ME 4860,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- This was the first time this class was offered in years. The labs did not line up with the content well. I feel like the labs contributed to my learning better than the lectures. This class really disappointed me with content. It should be labeled mechanics of materials 2. I wish it would have been more on metal forming processes and materials. I thought it would be relevant to industry and help me understand forging and die casting. The class description should be changed to reflect that this is the math behind deformation. :: Dr. Srinivasan is a good instructor, I felt like he got behind on his schedule and tried to play catch up which caused him to be less clear during lecture. :: Might need to lower his expectations for the class. the final projects were a lot to spring on us in the last two weeks. :: It is ridiculous that we are told to study homework and lecture examples for exams, but when we only have a single homework with a total of 5 problems that covers 3 chapters which was the only exposure of the exam material.  Then the average on the exam was a 44 he blames the students for not trying.  When the average on an exam is a 44 the professor is to blame, not the students!  So to make himself look better he decides to redo the exam on the final day of class.  With the final being in the following week. He had scheduled 6 projects during the semester but brushed them aside as they came along according to the syllabus schedule, with the exception of 1 which was due according to schedule.  But since he had it on the syllabus he still felt the need to assign 4 very time consuming projects in the last 2 weeks of the semester. :: He takes the cake for the worse professor I have had here at WSU. within the last two weeks of classes he assigned four labs and lab reports and an additional exam none of which were on the syllabus. Ive never had a teacher who cared so little about their students. :: really nice professor, but office hours are for helping not to be lectured on what I should know, I am there because I dont know. Spend more time answering questions and help with understanding not suggesting I go study more after I just came from studying. I wish the class had a lab to it still, that was the main reason for joining the class. :: Not relevant comments, no. :: He's a pretty cool dude. :: Dr. S needs to improve exams. They are not unreasonable and fair however, the questions are not very clear and we covered very few example problems. All of the example problems in the book are vague without solutions which left me unprepared for the exam. When Dr. S put equations on the exam, this clarified the direction the problem was taking the student. If it is the students job to understand this sort of questions without the equations, then more examples in class that are fully developed for the students are necessary. :: If you plan to do these labs in a future class, the university needs to get more licenses. I personally have trouble coming in outside of class due to work and other class commitments. :: I think this class would be far more successful if the lecture focused on application more than theory. Theory is defiantly needed, however, I don't feel like it should be the primary focal point of this course. Being a senior level engineering student, I would like to be able to apply what I learned from this class to my work in industry. I do not feel like I will be able to do that. I hope that in the future, the lectures will share an equal amount of theory as well as examples. Additionally, i think it would be very beneficial for the instructor to provide more context (written context) with his notes. It is very difficult for a student who is struggling with the theory of this content to review his/her notes because there is nothing to support the pages of numbers, incomplete derivations, etc. :: Not really. :: Try to be more clear when assigning FEA projects in Simufact. It was hard to understand what exactly was wanted for the results in these projects."
556,Scott Thomas,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- he is vary helpful and cares about how you are doing in his class. :: He does well in explaining concepts. :: Dr. Thomas was very engaging in lecture, and immensely interactive even with having so many students. His overall effectiveness in lecture was grand, I certainly enjoyed it more than many other courses in programming. The energy Dr. Thomas brought to the classroom was refreshing. :: he is a pretty good professor and cares about his students and wants everyone to understand the problem. :: The instructor creates a fun atmosphere for the class while teaching, allowing the students to retain the information better. :: The time spent on examples was very useful because it gave you time to work the problem by yourself but you would always have help if you needed it. :: Professor Thomas is a very effective instructor who stays on schedule with the syllabus and really makes sure that his students learn the material being covered.  He is funny, nice, and easy to approach with any question. :: Scott Thomas is effective in explaining the topics at hand. His patience and willingness to help is encouraging and welcoming in a very challenging academic field. Scott is well educated and very knowledgeable of the subject and should continue to instruct it. :: Mostly effective. :: Thomas is a great professor and he made being in his class fun while still teaching the material well. :: Very Helpful, willing to help with any misunderstandings of programming, go over exams and helps with homework assignments. :: 4/10. :: Very. :: He doesn't really teach the subject. Just puts up a problem then says now go. so we sit for 10 minutes not knowing how to program a problem then shows us how after nobody gets it. :: I felt that Scott was an effective instructor. He'd go over the material and do examples in class to help us get a stronger understanding of how we should go about the homework problems. :: Very knowledgeable on the subject and taught it in a relatable manner. :: He describes the material really well and his slides are well made.

558,Scott Thomas,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- he was always on time unless the people in his last class had a lot of questions after class. :: he was 2 minutes late one time through out the entire semester and he has to come from Russ from a class that ends at 3:30 I suspect. So very routinely started class at the start time. :: The whole class period was always used and only on rare occasion was Dr. Thomas ever late, considering that he had 50% more lectures than he's used to I'd say his punctuality was very good. :: yes. :: Everyday we were reminded that we start at ""3:35 exactly"" as he would state at the beginning of class. :: The class was almost always started at 'Three Thirty Five Exactly!' almost every day. :: Professor Thomas was on time most of the time for class and always notified the class if he was running late or would not be teaching that day.  The TA did a good job in his absence. :: Scott was always on time and ready to teach. :: Yes. :: Class was always started exactly on time and we stayed in class for the full duration. :: Yes.

559,Scott Thomas,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he would walk around the class when we where working and see if we needed help. :: He would answer any questions you had regardless of subject, after class. :: He regularly rounded about the class looking for students in need of help. He also held his curriculum with high esteem and energy which proved helpful, it's always easier to buy into what a class is teaching if the instructor believes in it right? For sure, and in these things he certainly demonstrated an interest in not only my learning but in the class's learning as a whole. :: the way he explains stuff. :: The sound effects the instructor made seemed silly in his demonstration but for some reason it helped me comprehend the information given. :: He was always energetic and made me care about what we were learning even if i wasn't feeling enthusiastic that particular day. :: Professor Thomas excels at teaching students one on one and shows genuine interest in my understanding of the material. :: Scott was very invested in our success and sought to ensure we did not fail. :: Demonstrated interest and asked what teaching tactics were best. :: Yes he was always available to help and always put the most effort into your understanding. :: Scott Thomas was willing to go over exam problems, homework problems and easily to contact through the email in syllabus. :: ?. :: By demonstrating interest in my learning. :: coming to students individually when nobody knew what to do. :: He demonstrated my interest by relating to the work I'd be doing once I get out in thee field of Engineering. :: Working out our questions on an individual basis without hesitation. :: Related course material to other courses/real life situations."

561,Scott Thomas,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Highly organized. The syllabus stated what we would work on each day and we did what it said every class. :: Oh yes, if it wouldn't have been- I'm sure the ""The all seeing, all knowing, all powerful syllabus"" would have done something about it, and it didn't so I say we're cool. I also observed a strict adherence to the syllabus anyway, to be more serious. :: yes. :: Yes. Every class and subject had informative slides and practice problems to go with it. :: The  class always followed what the syllabus said we were going to do that day. :: Yes and everything went according to schedule. :: Content is well organized and easy to follow along with. :: Yes. :: All the content was well organized and lectures could be followed along in the notes that he provided. :: Yes they were he followed the syllabus to the exact date and never strayed away from it. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I'd say yeah. :: Yes. :: Yes.

He definitely cares about his students and there education. :: very good. :: Very good!. :: very well. :: yes. :: pretty effective. :: I really like Dr. Roberts. I've had him for one other class. However, in both classes (including Capstone), he is on the less prepared side of things. Due dates are..fluid. Expectations are set, and that's appreciated. I think the biggest problem is that this sort of class looks good on paper, but is miserable when executed. :: Very effective and clear. Defines expectations well. :: Good. Overall good experience over the course of the two semesters for Capstone. :: Really helpful. :: Presented all material in an organized manner."

583,Rory Roberts,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Absolutely. :: He really pushed us to get every detail out of our senior design project and had some good stories to help us with career decisions. :: Dr. Roberts had biweekly meeting with every group to ensure that no one was falling behind. :: yes. :: Held regular meetings to make sure group was on-track. :: He asked questions and tried to get the class involved in discussion. :: yes. :: good way of teaching. :: yes. :: gave lectures on career topics, job etiquette, etc.. :: This class is proof of ""learning through failure"" so I don't think the instructor can really help much here. Our academic adviser didn't meet with us regularly, usually calling off. The project changed a lot, a couple of my teammates were miserable to be around. If this class wasn't mandatory, no one in their right mind would do it. :: Always available to help. :: Answered questions, covered material he felt was important. :: yes. :: Yes.

I enjoyed his classes very much and appreciate his desire to help us all become the best engineer we can be. :: I did not enjoy this class. We got assigned a project I had zero interest in and with a company who gave us the run around repeatedly. I feel like we were essentially free labor for a company that will not recognize our work the second we graduate. I understand that Wright State wants to provide the students with interesting projects and real work experience, but I think implementing something like Cincinnati's one semester of co-op would be more effective.  I could also be way off base and Dr. Roberts knows why that would not work.  I do think Dr. Roberts taught his way very well, even if his style did not work well for me. Also with the amount of work this class needs I am a little shocked it is not worth 4 credit hours. :: none. :: Thank you. :: yes. :: The best was I can describe this class in metaphorically: This class makes me feel what I think a beggar would feel like if they were forced to volunteer somewhere they hated, and they also hated volunteer work. You can't leave to make better use of your time (make money). And you can't even volunteer somewhere you like. You're just forced to spend time and work for free somewhere you don't care about (the project worked on). :: No. :: Only complaint was the sporadic schedule of notebook collection/grading during the second half of this semester. Kinda dropped off, which negatively affected notebook grades if one was bad, since there were fewer opportunities to make it up."
588,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. Fell asleep during presentations. Lecture time felt pointless and repetitive. :: Ha. Dr. Lieh's use of class time was completely pointless. It seems that each group had to present things to the class, just to present things. There would be three back to back weeks of presentations by groups. One week we would present a review of our projects, the next week we had to present the ""major milestones"" that our project has reached, and the third week we had to stand up as a group and get asked questions by other groups. All of this was done during the first week which was the review of the project. This was done several times during the semester. It would have been more useful to allow us to work on our projects during this time. :: By far the worst professor I have ever had the displeasure of taking. Too call him terrible does not even begin to quantify how poorly organized he and this course was. :: ehhh. :: Effective for the role of a capstone design class. Class time was usually a waste, but it allowed groups to not be overburdened and focus on their own projects. :: Awful, he did not care about student learning or the completion of our projects. He actually hindered us and made it more difficult to finish or capstone projects. :: This teacher was ineffective. Class time was used to teach irrelevant topics when we could have used pointers for our senior design project or used the class time to work on the project. :: I do not feel like I learned anything useful for my career as a professional engineer from the professor in this class. The class time was spent going over PPTs that appeared to be random and unnecessary. The only topics that seemed to be any benefit to my future as an engineer were the ones introduced by guest lecturers. Additionally, the professor never seemed to understand students or communicate well with them. Personally, when I would ask questions, very direct questions, the professor would continue to talk on a tangent about unrelated topics. If i would ask follow up questions for more clarity, he would raise his voice and appear to be irritated that I had to ask more than once. In the end my question would not be answered fully an I would be left confused about my course responsibilities. For the majority of the 2 semesters, it was very difficult to know what was expected of us. We did not receive rubrics for our proposals and due dates were constantly changing. :: Not very. Excessive classtime was spent on topics not related to the course, which ended up taking valuable time away from the capstone project. :: Overall fairly effective. :: He is very difficult to listen to. It seems really pointless what he talks about in this class. The time would be better spent working on our projects instead of presenting to the class that ""no, we haven't done anything since the last time we presented to you two days ago and yes, we are still waiting on parts to come in."" The time in class was either that or copying down powerpoint slides so fast that we couldn't actually learn what was on the slide. :: The fact that we have a teacher in this course is a formality at best - this is the very definition of no value added. This is a senior design course, ostensibly the most important learning experience we will engage in as future engineers - it's right there in the name, 'capstone'. However, we spent lecture time copying down problems off of tangentially related engineering-topic powerpoint presentations. I mean copying in the literal sense - word for word, problem statement and solution. Please explain to me how this is acceptable use of course time, especially at the hourly rate we pay at WSU, or an effective teaching method at all. I didn't run into this at Sinclair, and I certainly didn't expect to run into it here at an alleged higher-level institution of learning. It's embarrassingly bad and it's well-known in the department among students to avoid Dr. Lieh if they want to engage and learn the subject matter. This is his MO for every course he teaches. It is painful that he makes as much as he does, compared to the effort he puts in and especially compared to lecturers who go entirely out of their way to help out their students and go the extra smile. It's time to hang up the teaching hat, or at least be bumped to an adjunct. :: Could be a better presenter of material. not a big fan of his lecture style"
589,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- No. I doubt he graded anything. :: Capstone 2 didn't really have a syllabus to follow in terms of material that needed to be covered. However, every second of class time was a waste of time. Not much of anything provided during lectures pertained to project work, and the time spent in class could have been better used to work on our projects. :: No. He would not provide guidelines for us to follow in papers and presentations. And then he would become angry when we did not meet his expectations, which as stated previously, were poorly defined at best. :: yes. :: Nope. :: No. He marked off our assignments for issues we werenât told about. We would have easily delivered what was expected had we been given requirements. :: The majority of grades given by this professor did not come with a lot of feedback. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The grading seemed kind of random. Two people on a team would turn in practically the exact same pictures and descriptions and get different grades. :: Expectations were unclear. Often, we would receive back graded senior design notebooks with no comment to indicate the reasoning behind the grade. Sometimes we'd receive a graded paper back with erroneous grammar corrections on his part. :: yes"
590,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. However most of the time was spent giving team presentations and updates, even when it was repetitive and nothing was new. :: Yes, but it was a waste of time. :: He would routinely be late to class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes but he didnât teach much. He would have students present nearly every class period and fall asleep half the time. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He started on time and used the full class period even if he resorted to asking each member of the class where they were from. It would be very useful in this class to have some time to discuss in groups about the projects, but he makes every moment of time filled with him talking. :: He was prompt and mostly used the whole class time (for barely-related rambling or copying down problems), credit where credit is due. :: yes always"
591,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Gave a few lectures on various topics. :: My guess, he tried to lecture on things that he thought would be useful. He gave critiques on things, however, those generally didn't feel well thought out and felt more like he was critiquing just to critique. :: No. He was only interested in hearing himself talk and forcing us to do ridiculous in class ""examples"", which consisted of us writing down, word for word, a power point slide which contained 150 words. :: asked questions and asked for updates on our projects frequently. :: He showed no interest, the only time he cared was if he could interject to talk about himself. :: He didnât demonstrate much interest when he paid no attention to class presentations or even fell asleep. :: The professor would sleep during our in class presentations sometimes. I am not the only one who noticed this. We had about 10 presentations over the course of 2 semesters and I noticed him with his eyes closed through almost all of them. :: Answered any questions I had. :: He seemed to want you to learn the stuff, but didn't demonstrate that in the way he taught it. :: This course exists on a different planet than my passion for engineering and my interest in my senior design project. :: NO. but on a few subjects very much so"
592,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Lieh's communication was sub-par. Many times it was very unclear on how he wanted information portrayed to him. Responses to questions were generally unclear as well. :: Terribly. He would email us dates for assignments being due usually day of, and become agitated when half the class did not have the assignment being done because they didn't know it was due that day. :: decent. :: awful no one in the class knew what was gong on and he did not respond to email. multiple times he gave the class wrong information and shifted the blame when it surfaced. :: He rarelY answered emails. :: Very poorly. Course objectives were unclear. Very unclear. I struggled to produce good content for this class because of the professor. :: yes. :: Somewhat effectively. :: Extremely loudly. :: He seemed to answer emails promptly, but fell completely short on conveying course / assignment expectations. :: it was ok"
593,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Course was repetitive. Time would have been better spent on team actually working on the project. :: There was no organization in lectures. Things were presented in PowerPoint, which was ""organized,"" however, content covered in lecture seemed completely random. :: No. The lectures would consist of ramblings and inappropriate comments aimed at the class, often having nothing to do with whatever subject he was talking about. Also, many of the ""lectures"" contained useless information that had nothing to do with engineering. :: somewhat. :: NO!. :: The least organized class Iâve been in. Things were not made available to the class or if posted on pilot it was difficult to find. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No, they were very unorganized. They followed the syllabus roughly, but he would get off on tangents lecturing us about various topics. :: Individually the lesson plans were fine, but this was not a coherent course that propped up or prepared us for success in our senior design coursework. :: no could have been much better. Content we covered did not really help us become better engineers or to create better overall projects. I did like that he forced as to present so many times in class really helped my presentation skills"
594,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- No. :: Dr. Lieh was responsive. However, many times questions had to be repeated before a ""clear"" answer was given. Clear in this context means vague, which wasn't any more helpful than not knowing. In other words, it took several times of asking before he got what was truly being asked. :: I never went to his office hours because if his class is a waste of time, I assumed that his office hours would be an even bigger waste of time. I cannot comment, but can only assume that seeing him in his office would be as ineffective as seeing him in the classroom is. :: yes. :: NO. :: Impossible to get hold of. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Not really, I know a student who emailed him and didn't here back for two months and that was only because they emailed him again. :: No comment, I did not seek assistance outside of class. :: yes"
595,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- End the class. Use the time instead for groups to meet and work on projects. :: Dr. Lieh is a nice person. However, as an instructor, he was very ineffective and poorly used class time. :: Wright state has a budget crisis. I know of a professor who is completely useless and is only hemorrhaging more money from the university. I recommend immediate termination for Dr. Lieh. :: keeping professors like Lieh are the reason people avoid WSU and go to other schools. :: no. :: He had the groups present nearly every week and required every group ask questions. When you present every week thereâs not going To be a lot to update on. Class would have been better used as project work time. In the rare event he didnât require impromptu presentations, he would lecture on irrelevant topics such as traffic safety. :: I would have preferred to be in another section of capstone. Other students I've spoken with had clear responsibilities and had confidence in what they were submitting. This was not the case for my class. I don't think this professor should be teaching capstone to future engineers. :: Overall fairly good job. Just maybe be a little better organized. :: Overall this you left this class thinking ""Why did I even go to this class?"". :: Nothing personal to Dr. Lieh - he's a nice enough person, I had no issues there. However, I'm not evaluating him as a person, but as a teacher. It's seriously time for the department to intervene. Reputations of a school / department spread, it is a small world in SW Ohio and Wright State is already the small fish that needs to prove itself with the bigger players. There doesn't need to be any more damage done to compound existing issues.  Let's put it this way: most of the ME department lecturers and teachers are solid and enhanced my experience and I would take another course with them in a heartbeat. This class experience, as well as Capstone I and Machining (all Dr Lieh courses), throw the class average off in a huge, glaring, and inarguable way. I'm not even really specifically irritated at Dr. Lieh here, more at the  apparent lack of oversight and intervention in the face of busted and ineffective teaching methods."
596,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- he is good, punctual and dedicated towards teaching. :: Not the best. It is really hard to understand what he is saying. Also needs to explain a bit more how he coded the MATLAB code. Not learning a lot in this class. :: Laid back yet passionate about the material. Could benefit from having class more structured. :: good. :: You are a joke of a professor, holy crap man, i would have learned more from you by not showing up a single day and reading the textbook. learned absolutely nothing from you but how to type matlab code you had written or stolen while you were rambling at us. :: Dr. Lieh is an absolutely ineffective instructor. It is evident that he does not really care whether or not the students understand the material. He is not self aware of his teaching abilities. In class assignments consisting of copying matlab code from a powerpoint into the program are the majority of time spent in class. Pilot is not used despite the the front page for posting files. There is no organization to these front page files however. No grades are posted on Pilot. It was not until the last few weeks of the semester that grades were given back for the first exam, which was presented on a cut out piece of a printed excel sheet. An insultingly incoherent email was also sent out by the TA a few days afterwards with homework grades. Overall this course was a waste of time, although it was easy. If the precedent is for students to not care about the courses they take and only work for the credit hours so they can graduate, then this is a good class. As a serious, senior level engineering class however, the course is an embarrassment for the already laughable Wright State curriculum. :: Very good. :: Good. :: yes. :: Nice guy, fairly ineffective teaching style. 90% of class time is spent COPYING Matlab code that he did. Copying code didn't reinforce what the point of the code was, so the entire class (quite literally the entire class) didn't know what was supposed to be learned. Most of the exams were left incomplete since we didn't know how to do things like run Simulink and turn systems in Matlab using ode45 to Simulink models and vice versa. :: 1. :: Pretty effective. Would prefer if he worded through examples rather than just showing them on a Powerpoint. :: Not the best, lectures were hard to pay attention to, exams didn't seem all that relevant to course, confusion on final project. :: Not very effective. Unrealistic expectations on what the class can do on exams and hw when he doesnât teach well in class. :: good. :: Fairly effective. Good discussion on the concepts of the course and some worthwhile matlab skills were developed. :: I learned next to nothing. Such a complicated subject needs to be presented differently somehow. The notes were pretty much completely ripped out of the book which I don't even think is legal. :: Pretty effective. :: Somewhat effective. Explains concepts well but is hard to follow some times. :: I've had Dr Lieh in the past and he did very well but the way this class was structured I don't think I got as much out of it as I could have. He did a brief overview of simple Simulink models that Ive never done before and when we covered material we needed to apply complicated topics using Simulink so I was a challenge that's for sure."
597,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. But it took too long for us to know what grade we had. We didn't get any grades until two weeks ago. :: Not exactly, class was often times unsure when assignments were to be completed, as the schedule provided in the syllabus was very loosely followed. :: Yes. :: rarely if at all, didnt stick to grading guidlines of the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes and no. Yes, we checked off all the boxes in the syllabus in terms of graded work. No, much of that work felt like a formality and an exercise in futility most of the class in assuming it'll be curved. :: 2. :: Yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Maybe? We didn't get a single grade until late March.. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: We did have a syllabus at the beginning but he used the TA to do most all of the grading and Im not sure the TA did what he was supposed to as we didn't get any feedback or any type of grade until week 13."
598,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. he is punctual and the class will go throughout the time allocated. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: always ran over because you assigned things with five minutes to go, making the class who used the room after us start late every time because we were still in there. thanks for nothing. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, started class on time. No, didn't end class on time. :: 3. :: Yes. :: Yes, often going over by five minutes, which was annoying to our class and the one after ours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always started on time and would typically go until the very end of class. :: Yes Dr Lieh was on time every day and used the full time."
599,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- with the help of matlab , solving the textbook problems. :: Yes, but again too hard to understand. Needs to slow down when he talks. :: By his drive to teach and explain the material. He seems to really enjoy what he does. :: Yes. :: not at all, not graded on hardly anything important. almost all completion based. you are a joke of a professor, and if you had any self respect or respect for the students who paid to learn things from a class of yours, you would give half a rats ass about your job. as it is, you dont and its quite evident. you are either the worst communicator at this university, or you are a moron, im not sure which. :: Using lecture notes. :: By making sure we used our in-class time working on relevant material to stimulate learning. :: yes. :: He is very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. He just doesn't convey it well. A lot of the grade felt given and not earned. :: 4. :: Would stay longer to answer questions. Would ask you how you were doing if you ran into him outside of class. :: Answered questions, asked questions. :: PowerPoints had a lot of equations but I didnât learn much about the actual parts of a car or engineering them. :: He engaged the class with his lectures. :: Yes. :: He was very energetic in our learning and he obviously showed interest in us. :: Keep things interesting and also had students do in class problems. :: He would go around and ask if we needed help and point some of the mistakes."
600,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- he will clarify any doubts in and out of classroom at any time. unless he has some important work, he would clarify only on office hours. :: He did well. :: He did just fine with email response outside the classroom. :: Yes. :: horrible, took you days to respond to emails, when i asked you questions in class or after class you seemed incapable of giving me a straight answer. you are the reason i got stress headaches most every MWF. :: good. :: Very well. :: yes. :: There is a pretty distinct language barrier. I knew what he was saying, but it was often a thick accent to dig through. Not to mention that he yelled a lot. Not angrily, just, like, shouting instead of talking. :: 5. :: Yes. :: Okay. :: He struggled to communicate. His accent is pretty thick and when students would ask for clarification he would start shouting at them. I only knew when things were due if they were written on the board or emailed to us. He also doesnât listen to students arguing their points and will cut them off if he thinks heâs right. :: very effectively. :: Fine. :: Pretty well. :: Communicated fairly decent. :: Good for the lectures, but sometimes he would go faster than we could type so when we had in class assignments It was hard to keep up with the new topics and in class projects."
601,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. But it seemed like his slides were straight from the book. :: Powerepoint lectures were utilized and were sufficient, however there was a disconnect between the lectures and the homework. Homework was extremely hard and the lecture material did not help. :: Yes. :: not really, would it absolutely kill you to use pilot like it is designed, uploading lectures and syllabus and stuff in the content, not as announcements. :: yes. :: Yes, very. :: yes. :: Maybe? Again, most of the class was spent copying down his code while he talked in the background. I don't have a solution for this since ALL of the class is matlab and simulink submissions, and I don't think he's going to change that. :: 6. :: Yes. :: Not really, often required looking at charts and graphs that wasn't adequately explained, causing confusion. :: Course content was all posted in the news section and in order to find the slide that had the homework assignment on it I would have to filter through all the lectures just to find the hw assignment. I wish he had uploaded the files under the content section and would split them up accordingly. :: yes. :: Sure. :: Yes. :: Very well organized. :: I think he tried to do a paperless semester but there are still some bugs that need worked out. Posting the lectures on pilot was nice but he would include the hws in the lecture notes and when he would add to them some had parts A and B and it was hard to keep track of what hw was due when and which lecture it was located."
602,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I haven't got enough chance to meet him in office hours. :: Dont know. :: was reasonably responsive online. :: Yes. :: no, you are horrible at this. you take days to do your job and respond. either be a researcher or a professor, cause you cannot seem to balance both. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 7. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I didn't need him outside of class but he was always available after class."
603,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Spring,ME 6240,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- At first, I found this subject hectic and difficult since I wasn't used to MAT LAB. But now, i could handle easy problems but, I need some more time to tackle difficult problems in MAT LAB. If the textbook problems were done in hand method, I would have scored cent in my exams( pretty sure). :: Not his fault but the intro to Matlab course did not effectively prepare students for this course. The intro to Matlab course needs more emphasis on Simulink to effectively prepare students for this course. :: No. :: i am utterly disappointed in your performance as a professor, although i am not surprised. given my experience with you already, you performed up to my expectations of failure. you and your class are a joke, and you cannot hope to teach anyone anything lasting in this manner. i could not be more displeased that I had to waste my money on the hopes of an A for participation from you for this class, since everyone of us walking out of it knows nothing about what we paid to be taught. shameful and terrible performance, and I hope no other student ever takes a class of yours to suffer the same way i did at your incompetent hand. :: thank you!. :: I learned more about MATLAB in this course than in any other class, and I will be able to apply this to my upcoming internship. :: yes. :: 8. :: Making us copy MATLAB code out of the notes and turning it in is not going to teach us how to do the math if you are not going to thoroughly go over the formulas and code used to generate the results. My younger sisters can copy code and check it to see if it exactly matches what is listed int the notes but that does not mean they have any idea what is going on. This was a poor teaching method that only served to confuse those who do not have as proficient skills in MATLAB. Numbers appeared in codes that were never explained where they came from. Foreign coding methods were used with no explanation to how they worked. These were not things that could be figured out intuitively and required a great deal of though to try to understand what was going on. It was not a good teaching method and made it hard to learn material, let alone retain it. :: The language barrier was really hard for me and several other students to get past. I also wish the course hadnât been just MATLAB or it wouldâve been described that way when I signed up for the course. I wish I couldâve learned more about how a car is put together rather than learning how to make plots. :: More input from the professor would have been helpful for the group project. Also, the tests frequently felt like they were more of a test on matlab skills as opposed to tests over the course material. Otherwise, I enjoyed the course. :: There has to be some way to restructure this class and teach it effectively. The class is heavily MATLAB and SIMULINK which isn't a problem until you try to do anything independently. Most students did not know how to do the homework assignments and considerable portions of the exams. There needs to be an advanced MATLAB class that actually teaches SIMULINK in-depth. :: Thanks for another good semester. TOUCHDOWN!!!! Also the class title should almost be Vehicle Suspension Engineering because I really thought we were going to more topics that covered a vehicles drive train."
604,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The effectiveness was fine. :: Pretty good. :: Dr. Bae is really into reliability and it showed. I enjoy learning from professors who enjoy what they are teaching. :: Instructor was very effective with teaching the required material and doing examples in class for better understanding of concepts. :: Not great but also not bad. Somewhere right in the middle. The lectures are okay, sometimes dry but that's due to the material. I like the involved style where he writes on the board a lot, not just going from the projector. :: Very good. :: the instructor was not very effective at all, he does not explain things clearly and doesn't clearly answer questions. :: Very effective by describing the material behind the course as well as showing numerous examples. :: Excellent. :: fine. :: The lectures and course work were fine. Communication on expectations could be improved. :: I feel like I learned the important course material in this class. I wish that some of the information was more clearly presented in the course materials as it could be difficult to keep up when Dr. Bae was going over the derivations for distributions. :: Very effective with a lot of examples to help students who didn't have a deep knowledge of the material. Towards the end of the course, though, the material did get difficult but there were less and less example problems and more focus on using software."
605,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Mostly. Some things discussed in the syllabus were not covered in class. :: Mostly but not really. The midterm had a bunch of things that were on a later lecture. :: Yes. :: Yes, course syllabus was followed. Expectations were clearly defined at the beginning of semester. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The instructor gives little to no credit for even simple mistakes on exams which makes the grading very harsh. :: Yes, he graded and evaluated my work based on the solutions he gave out in class in order to help us reach our goal of understanding. :: Yes. :: kind of. :: Yes, but the expectations could be expanded on. :: Yes. :: Yes"
606,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. However, the only time class ever did not go over was on test day. I don't mind staying a couple extra minutes to finish a thought in a lecture, but it would be nice to give a couple extra minuted to complete the test that most of the class has not turned in yet. :: Yes, instructor always started class on time and ended class on time. Class sometime went over required time if class was engaged and interested in topic. :: Usually. He was occasionally a couple of minutes late due to his class right before ours. He also never seemed to quite figure out when exactly class was supposed to end, but he didn't usually keep us too long. :: Yes. :: He was usually late getting to the class and occasionally held the class over. :: He would start class on time everyday and ran class till the very last minute. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was punctual, but frequency ran over by 5-10 minutes. :: Yes"
607,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Did not. :: He had high expectations for our project. :: yes. :: Instructor used plenty of real-world examples so the theory that was thought could be applied in various applications. In addition, instructor used Matlab for learning which which was a vital element to this course. :: Office hours and a final project. :: He likes what he is teaching and he is very smart. :: The instructor did not answer questions or present the material clearly. :: He would reply to my emails quickly and effectively. He would also pause to see if anyone had questions frequently throughout the lecture. :: Excellent. :: no such thing happened. :: Dr. Bae promoted us learning relevant topics and discussed important information. :: By using classwork to engage students to work through examples with him, and staying after class to answer students' questions"
608,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Poorly. Needed to spend more time on simple topics and seemingly had thrown together lectures. :: Well enough. :: Dr Bae, did a lot of examples in class. This was very good. Way too often professors try to teach with out examples. However, Dr. Bae did several examples each class. That was awesome keep it up Dr. Bae To maximize the benefit from the examples it would be nice to write the problem, that we are solving, down on the board. that way it is easier to go back and reference in our noted later. One more time - Good work will all the examples. :: Instructor communication was very effective through the use of email and pilot. :: Pretty well. Sometimes it seemed like there was a bit of a language barrier but nothing extreme. :: very good. :: the instructor was not good at communicating clearly and typically left me more confused than I was before asking questions. :: The instructor was very effective with communicating both in and out of the classroom. He helped out with any questions we had. Also, he would respond to emails as fast as he could. :: Excellent. :: fine. :: Most effective in one on one communication. :: He communicated primarily through messages on the Pilot course homepages.  I wish that there was more cooperation between pilot and wings. :: Class size was small so in-class communication was effective."
609,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, course content followed a logical progression. Lectures were always on track and covered main points. :: Yes. :: yes. :: the powerpoint where well organized. :: Yes very well organized and went right along with the book and syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Reasonably well.  Sometimes subject matter contained too many slides while other subjects should have had more support material. :: Yes"
610,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always available for office hours or by appointment if needed. :: Yes. :: yes. :: the instructor was good at answering questions right after class but it was nearly impossible to schedule time with him outside of that. :: yes. :: Yes. :: kind of. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was reasonably fast with his responses outside of the classroom. :: Yes, if applicable"
611,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7060,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- None. :: Good work with the examples! Thanks for all of your help this semester. :: N/A. :: No. :: The time given to complete the project was not nearly enough, and for what was expected 10% was not enough credit. :: Great class very helpful. :: I enjoyed this course. :: No"
612,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not great. Spends lots of time going over derivations and a power point presentation when more notes need to be written on the board and more examples need to be gone over. The class would have felt more beneficial if it has more hand written notes and more homework that was less derivation and more building code. :: Very good at explaining the subjects and concepts. :: He did a good job of explaining things in greater depth than the textbook or class notes. :: Use of matlab and powerpoint was not the most effective way to teach an advanced FEA course. :: Kind of okay, but harsh. :: I thought Dr. Bae was an effective instructor. Most of the class time was spent with lecture. I wish we would spend more time doing actual examples on the board. The professor spent a lot of his lecture time reading off of power point notes and going through Matlab code. For some people this may be effective but for me it didn't help me with the material very well. :: The professor was very willing to help answer questions Professor did not seem to be into the subject. :: Explained the subject concepts clearly, homework reinforced concepts taught in class, and posted grades in a timely manner. :: Dr. Bae is very helpfull. :: Alright. It would have better if there were more examples in class to demonstrate the concepts better. I had difficulty at times trying to connect the equations in the correct order to get what I was looking for and the notes weren't always clear. :: The instructor took a very complex subject and was able to explain what was going on very well. He was a very good communicator, and gave excellent examples to help the students learn. :: The examples given by the instructor are very unclear. He does a lot of Matlab, Abaqus, and  Mathematica examples, however 70% of our course grade is over our ability to answer written test questions. It makes no sense that he would do so little written examples, then count most of our grade on that type of evaluation. :: Good. :: fine. :: Good. :: The professor covered course topics fairly well, however he was not the best at communicating his expectations for assignments. :: Dr. Bae was reasonably effective.  I feel like I was underprepared for the midterm, but I now feel as though I have a grasp of the important concepts. :: Overall he is average professor always want to teach on software rather than by hand derivation and calculation. :: Great professor with deep knowledge of the subject matter. Class lectures definitely favored students who have previously had courses with him in undergrad; those that didn't felt disadvantaged since not all the prerequisite topics were covered the same way at other institutes. :: He has been great. He comes up with creative ways of evaluating a student, may it be an exam or a homework assignment. I would say, he is effective for a student's academic growth."
613,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- The evaluations seemed fair. No surprise assignments, lots of time to complete homework. Went over all them material discussed in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Mostly. :: Yes. Course work was evaluated based on the course syllabus. Homework, exams and class work was weighted as stated out on the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The course syllabus is not permanently posted anywhere, it is only placed in the notifications on pilot. Also changes to how the project would be evaluated where being changed up until about 2 weeks before it was due, originally there was nothing stated about an interview/presentation or partners turning in different papers. It would have been nice for the project to be assigned earlier with clear instructions that would not be changed. :: Yes. :: fine. :: Yes. :: Yes, but the expectations could have been expanded on further. :: Yes. :: Strictly No. :: Yes. As long as we knew the concept and could show how to correctly apply it, small arithmetic errors were insignificant in terms of points taken off. :: Yes, Dr. Bae evaluated my work as expected."
614,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He did; in fact he actually went over a lot of times. :: The class time always started on time and the full class period was used. If the instructor couldn't make it a guest lecturer came to run the class. :: Yes,. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He usually started class on time and used the whole period. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was punctual.  He occasionally ran over by 5-10 minutes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very much, he was spot on with the class timings and usage of full class period."
615,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He went over plate elements because apparently people wanted to know about plate elements, once. :: He would ask if we had questions or if we were understanding the material. :: On a few days, he would end class early so that we could approach him with questions about our final project. :: Always asked if we had questions. :: Yes. :: Well enough. :: The instructor often instructed us to go to office hours. Unfortunately the office hour was at a terrible time. Often very late in the week. Being a graduate student and busy with work it was very difficult to make this office hour to meet with the professor. Dr. Bae would schedule you a time to meet with him if the office hour time didn't work. :: Yes. :: Available for questions after class and accommodated meeting times outside of his office hours. :: To be honest, when I took FEA and vibrations with him in the past years, I enjoyed learning those materials more. I think Dr. Bae should go back to the way he was teaching those two classes in the future. :: Answered questions in class. :: He was available both during and after class to answer questions. He knew the material and did a very good job communicating. :: I honestly feel as if the professor could care less about my learning. :: Good. :: fine. :: explaining with examples. :: Dr. Bae was willing to answer questions during class time that were relevant to the discussion. :: Not at all. He is always talking about projects not the course curriculum. :: By using classwork to make sure we fully grasped the concept and asking questions at the end of every class. :: He used to come up with innovate homework assignments, which made me to think out of the box."
616,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Poorly. Did not respond to emails. seemed preoccupied with other things. Every encounter felt rushed and that somehow it was a complete inconvenience. :: Usually got an email response pretty quickly. :: He did a good job. :: A lot of the assignments had instructions that were pretty unclear. :: Yes. :: Not that effectively. :: Dr. Bae answered emails and was available with a scheduled meeting. He communicated when class was cancelled or when assignments were due. :: He was willing to help most of the time. :: Replied promptly to e-mails. :: Very good with email. :: Good. Updated Pilot with assignments. :: He was very effective in communicating inside the classroom. :: The instructor does not make it clear what he finds important for exams, he states that the exams will be over a wide range of material then only tests over a few chapters. He also tends to test over things that he made seem insignificant in class or only covered very briefly, then the things he said would be good exam questions never show up. :: Good. :: can do better. :: very well. :: Much more effective at communicating one on one. :: Dr. Bae made himself available on class days after 7:30 PM. :: Pretty Good. :: Decently well, communicated via Pilot mostly if out of the classroom. :: He was quite helpful both in and out of the classroom."
617,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Prepared before hand? yes? Cohesive and explained the material as a whole? No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Content was in order but the lectures had almost zero example problems. :: Power points conveyed information well, but it was annoying that there were up to 3 versions of a single chapter on pilot. :: Pretty well. :: The course lectures were organized but i thought it could of been better. The content was not delivered in a very effective manner. Lecture notes were often not posted until the lecture was over. He lectured off of power point slides and matlab code. More in class examples on the board would of been better. :: I think the lectures could have been improved by working more problems and better defining the examples. In my notes I have no idea what the problems were we worked in class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. However, I don't think all the lecture notes made their way onto Pilot. :: For this specific class, I got a little confused for how to use the different stiffness matrix methods or each of the strengths and weaknesses. I was expecting there to be more of an emphasis on the different types of analyses (static, dynamic (linear and non-linear), axisymmetric, infinite elements, plasticity models, etc.), but we spent most of our time learning how to derive the forms of different stiffness matrix forms. It would have been nice to delve into some of these advanced topics, but otherwise it was a very well organized class. :: he skips around a lot making things even more confusing. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: There could have been a more effective background.  I took my undergraduate FEA course 8 years ago and was not able to pick up the content until after the midterm. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes, it was well organized."
618,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Typically, but again the encounters felt rushed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The professor answered emails and was available during office hours. Office hours were very late and not at a convenient time. :: ~. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The only office hours offered where late at night and the professor said himself that if nobody showed up within the first 30 minutes or emailed him to make an appointment he would leave. He is not very responsive to email and it can take roughly 5 days just to get him to give you a very vague answer. :: Yes. :: kind of. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I presented questions during class and online.  He was generally helpful. :: Not for first time, he replies if we try to contact him twice. :: Yes, if applicable. :: Yes, I was able to clarify my queries with him."
619,Harok Bae,2018 Spring,ME 7120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I wish that we would spend a little more time doing practice/example problems with actual numbers and a little less time focusing on the theory. You should consider putting together a tutorial on the basic steps to follow to be able to run a Job in Abaqus. :: More examples to study for the exam. :: At the end of the semester, every chapter went together, but at the beginning it felt like we were learning discrete, unrelated information. Next time, reassure students that while it doesn't look like it all fits together, it does. :: None. :: This is my second graduate semester and second 7000 level course. Matlab is a very helpful tool and i think it should be taught as an undergrad much more if professors continue to use it for lecture material and for class grades.  I am a mechanical engineer and computer coding is not a strength of mine. I only had one coding class and it was over 6 years ago as an undergrad freshman. It makes it very difficult when it comes to my graduate level class when i have to learn matlab skills again or even brand new to it. I don't think course grades should be determined based off of your ability to use matlab when it is not in your major course content. I don't believe that is fair. :: I think Dr. Bae is a good guy. At times I did struggle to learn from lectures though. I do think he could improve this and be a great teacher by better defining what he is teaching us. Thanks for all of your help,. :: Dr. Bae is awesome. :: I found it a bit ridiculous that half of the grade in the class depends on the last two weeks with 10% on the final project and 40% on the final exam, meaning that all the work completed over the semester is only half the grade in the class.  A couple of the homework assignments didn't seem relevant to the class (Homework 2 and Homework 4) as they depended more on coding ability in Matlab and Mathematica and ability to quickly learn Abaqus, rather than ability to apply concepts from class. At least, that is what I primarily took away from those homework assignments. While I could see the build-up of concepts from class, the challenge in those homework assignments wasn't the class concepts, but my abilities to use those softwares, which didn't strike me as completely fair since this isn't what the class is on. The final project was a pain. Not only did we have to quickly learn how to adequately learn to use Abaqus (which you couldn't help us with so I don't know why you made that an option as it made it even more difficult), what I gathered from the feedback on the in-class presentations was that you wanted professional-grade analysis on things we were still learning. I didn't feel like I had a good handle on the concepts from class because minimal examples were done, so in the project I was lost and fumbling my way through it because I didn't know what I didn't know until I had problems with it and then I was half way to figuring it out. Then, after fumbling our way through the project and presenting, you seemed to realize that we have no idea what we are doing and completely changed the direction and your expectations for our project, requiring us to essentially completely redo our project in a week's time at the end of the semester with other class's projects wrapping up and finals week approaching. Since you wanted a part of the analysis to be unique to each group, I felt a better way to approach this would be to list the different analysis methods (topology, centripetal force application, bucking, vibration, etc.) then have a simpler, more achievable project for each method. Instead what happened is we though we had a decent handle on the project, but then when we presented, you realized the project was way too advanced and we didn't know what we were doing, and it wasn't up to the standards you had set, so we had to start from the basics. We got thrown into the middle of the pool trying to figure out the Matlab code and Abaqus and then you realized the unreachable goals of the project when our presentations weren't what you expected because we encountered problems because of this. :: The classroom setup was not ideal at all for this type of class. This does not have anything to do with the professor I don't think, but the group table setup was not conducive to learning as it spread the class out across an entire long room. The professor could have made more use of the document camera instead of using the board as much, but I also think that graduate classes that are of the lecture style should not be held these unconventional classrooms because it is very difficult to see the writing on the board on the other side of the classroom which makes it very hard to draw connections between what the professor is saying and the material on the board. :: The project is assigned way to late putting a lot of stress on students to be able to complete the project. It would help to either have weekly project deliverables so that students could start working on small project tasks early or assign everyone the same project so that the instructions and expectations where clear. :: start with simple to more practical examples. :: No. :: More Focus toward Projects rather than course. His Homeworks are too hard.  No matter what subject teach for any class, he is always talking about matlab. :: No"
620,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- effective. :: Very effective, taught very well and had a genuine interest in the student's learning and the material. :: he was very helpful. he makes sure that you're putting forth effort and if you are he is willing to help. very prepared for class and he seems that he is very interested in the material as well as the students. :: Very hard but learning. :: effective. :: amazing instructor. :: Mostly effective. :: Dr. B is very effective and maintains energy throughout lecture. :: Craig was a very good professor. He would never leave anyone behind and always made sure everyone's code would run before moving on. :: Very effective. :: Well. :: He taught the material very well, one of the best professors I've ever had. :: very effective. :: Very effective. He taught the information in a manner that was really helpful to someone that had never programmed before. :: Dr. B is very effective. :: Very effective. Gave clear explanations and examples. :: This class is one of the more difficult classes yet he creates an atmosphere that challenges and helps the students learn. Even though it is a tough class he goes above and beyond for any student that tries. :: He was a very hard instructor, and to me was not the most effective. :: Good. Was willing to work separately with students and was fair. Also challenged students during lecture, which was helpful. :: Great instructor. :: Love Dr. B, he is by far my favorite professor that I have ever had. I will continue to take his classes whenever possible. His lecture were well organized and he always made sure that we understood the topic before moving on. I felt that he did a great job at pacing especially with people being on so many different levels of coding experience. :: He is very effective, but his project for us was like nothing we learned in the class. :: Amazing. :: Dr. B is a great prof. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and is always eager to try things a new way!!!!. :: extremely effective. :: Very effective instructor, excellent at communication and teaching a larger class size. :: good. :: Very effective. :: He was a good professor and taught the content very well."
621,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes, the course work was evaluated based on the syllabus. All of the work was completed within a reasonable time period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: His syllabus was a perfect reflection of his evaluation of my work,. :: He evaluated our work based on the expectations but took them way to serious. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he graded in a timely fashion and in a very fair manner. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did everything as he described in the syllabus."
622,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the class would always start on time. He would use all of the class time making sure everyone is on the same page, followed by lots of examples to help with homework. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes- it was needed! He often stayed after to help those struggling. :: He always started class on time ans always used the full class period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. B always had a full schedule planned for a day. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he started on time every day, and he used every minute of class every day."
623,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: Yes, he answered questions to the best of his ability and made sure the students understood what he was saying. :: by making sure that everyone was on the same page and understood everything before moving on. :: Interactive class work. :: demonstrated well. :: was very enthusiastic. :: He seemed enthusiastic about teaching. :: He encouraged students to learn more than what was required and to learn about similar topics to be better prepared for the future. :: Craig was very interested in what we were learning in the class. He was very excited and ready to teach this kind of material to us. The fact that he was passionate about the material made it a lot more enjoyable to learn along the way. :: He met outside of office hours and always answered emails in time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: he offered office hours and helped a lot. :: Yes. Dr. B was very passionate about the class and that made learning it easier. :: He was always available for questions and actively walked around the classroom throughout lectures. :: Anyone that showed him something he showed an interest. He also was very receptive to different ways of learning. He would share this new knowledge with the class and give credit to the student. :: He would push the whole class as hard as he could without bound, and he would try to help you when he could. :: Yes. Always challenged and often made us think outside of the box. :: He was very enthusiastic and enjoyed teaching. Was open to new ideas from students, even if they were wrong or bad. :: Yes, Dr. B made it his utmost priority to make sure we are prepared not only for exams but for workplace by including helpful hints and real world experiences. :: he was very interested in making sure that no one was left behind. :: Office hours, extremely responsive to emails, takes extra time out of class to go through tough topics. :: He is a very personable prof and always seems ready to help his students. :: he was ALWAYS available to talk MATLAB and provided explanation whenever it was needed.  He also was extremely passionate about the subject he was teaching. :: Yes. :: great. :: Yes. :: He made sure we understood all of the content in class, and the TAs were always available either in the office hours or through email."

His office hours were very useful. :: Very well. :: Excellent communication. :: He communicated very effective, the best out of any professor that I have had so far. :: well. :: Great. :: Very well. :: very effectively. :: Very effective in communication, always knew what was going to happen and when. :: good. :: Very effectively. :: He communicated exceptionally both in the classroom and in pilot and using emails."
625,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes very organized. :: Yea. :: kinda. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The class was well organized and had plenty of time for learning the material. The lecture notes and in class  examples would make this hard coding class seem easier. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Great organization and lectures. :: the content and lectures we okayish organized, it needs a lot of improvement to make the class more understandable. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, his content was organized so that it flowed logically and smoothly while also being available for use for studying and as a source of help. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes very well. :: Yes, everything was very well organized."

627,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- the class feels more like a 2000 to 3000 level class. :: Thanks for all the help!. :: Thought the project was unnecessary. Other Matlab course had it muh easier. :: hes a great teacher. :: No I do not. :: I hope to have him as an instructor in future courses. :: Very good teacher. The class was fair and challenging. :: Dr. B is the first professor/teacher I have ever had that I thought was both fair and challenging. Normally those words don't go hand in hand when talking about an instructor but he has it figured out. :: Cassie is a great TA and she helped many students grow academically and personally as they work to balance their learning and ""adulting.""  Whatever she is paid she should get a lot more!. :: That this class took over my life and it is only a three credit hour class, I feel as if all of my other classes had to take aback seat while I had to devote all my time to your. Resulting me getting behind in most of my other classes (which were all worth more credit hours). I do not agree with how much work you demand out of the student in your class, it was  a struggle and I did everything that I could to make it better, I feel as if the class work load needs to lightened up. :: The exams needed to be more reasonable. A lot of students ran out of time. Although it may not have effected me as much, this area needs some improvement. :: None. :: Dr. B. is probably my favorite prof since I have been here. I had him for Solidworks and liked him so much then I wanted to take Matlab with him. The only thing I wish that was different in this class however is if we started python a week sooner. I feel I did not have enough time to learn anything about it or see what there is to offer in it that is different than matlab or even better than matlab. Another thing is if the project was due Thursday before the exam and not Sunday. Partly my own problem/ reason is I would be fully done before finals week is fully underway. There is always more work to do with this project, always things to change and items to add. In all the class was actually fun!! I hated matlab for the first 4 weeks or so of this class and dreaded going to class, by the end, even though things got harder I really did enjoy going to class, and working on the project was fun too!!! See you around Dr. B :). :: One of the best professors in the engineering department. :: Fantastic instructor. :: no. :: Dr. B is a pretty cool guy and a good, but hard professor."
628,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: Very good at explaining what is expected of us as students. :: He was a very good professor. He cared about all of his students, and wanted each person to succeed."
629,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes.

631,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: Yes. :: He would always ask how we were doing, and would walk around the classroom asking if anyone needed help. He is also very upfront with trying to help students get jobs. He offered office hours, and cared about all of his students."
632,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: Good. :: He was very good. if we had questions we could post on pilot or email him, and he was very quick to respond. In the classroom he went over the material a few times to make sure everyone fully understood what was being taught. He would be flexable with students schedules, and would not move to another lesson until he knew we felt comfortable with the material."
633,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes.
634,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
635,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 8,0
636,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- I learned more in this three hour Matlab class than I did in all of my other courses combined. I also feel that everything I learned in this course will directly apply to my career one day.
637,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes.
638,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Always on time.   Always all of the time.
639,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He is available always. He is prepared, always. He worked harder than anyone else in the room. He is enthusiastic, and he made me want to know how to do Matlab. Dennis went the extra mile for lots of students, recommending us for co-op jobs. He had to have spent at least 40 hours outside of school time taking meetings for funding and  getting placements for interns and co-ops.  I would not have a co-op position without him."
640,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Great.
641,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- It appears that Dennis invested at least two hours worth of prep for any one hour of class. He had power points, notes, example programs and materials for students to prepare with before class. He had also obviously spent a good deal of time preparing projects for us to complete. Some thought went into creating problem sets that were at once challenging and achievable."
642,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He is always there early, and always has time for us. He ends each lecture with: 'What do you need from me?'"
643,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- We are so lucky to have Dennis.   I have never experienced anyone like him. He cares about all of his students, and goes the extra mile or more for us. Dennis is an embassador for your campus as well. I spoke with some people in industry while looking for a co-op job.   Anyone who hears what these folks have to say about Dennis, and your engineering programs here, will be impressed with Wright State. Most notable, if you want to hear really good things, Crown.

644,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dennis was very helpful throughout the course. :: Very motivating to do best and stay on task. :: He knows the material and does a great job explaining it. :: Dennis Hance is a very in depth and dedicated professor. He pushes his students to be the best they can be. It is up to the student on how much they want to give back to themselves because not everything can be taught during class times. Overall, as long as the student is willing to put in the effort, the sky is the limit on how much they are able to learn from Mr. Hance. :: The instructor had a great overall effectiveness. He made sure that we knew exactly to expect in the work force after college. :: He is an effective instructor. He does a better job than most. :: Very effective. Used different techniques to gain students' attention. :: He was good and worked with the class to help accommodate us. :: Effective. :: Mr. Hance is an excellent instructor.  He conveys the course material clearly and is willing to answer any questions.  He is available throughout the day to answer any questions and seems genuinely interested in the success of his students."
645,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the course syllabus laid out all of the expectations for the semester. Whether it be course work, tests, projects, presentations, competitions, everything will be done at the end of the semester. :: Yes. :: Yes, it was how it was laid out in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, expectations were clearly defined prior to start of the course and work was evaluated in adherence to these expectations."
646,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he would often wait until the clock hit exactly 12:00 to start so that it would give everyone a chance to get to class and if you were late, it was your fault because he wouldn't let the late person hold the rest of the class down. He also used the full class period to its maximum and if he did let us out early it was to work in our teams on our projects. :: Yes. :: Yes, he would start the minute the clock striked 12 and stop at 1:20. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor was present before class began and the entire class period was utilized."
647,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Guest speakers and examples. :: He was always willing to answer questions and put forth extra effort. :: Dennis demonstrated interest in our learning by giving us different ideas if we were ever stuck or didn't know what to do. He is a very dedicated professor and wants his students to succeed. :: He taught to us as a friend, he made sure that we could relate to him. :: He would meet with us outside of class time and was willing to assist us even when it was not his office hour time. He provided advice to us for several aspects of the project. :: Relating course material to real life occurrences/experiences. :: He asked for feedback and routinely asked if we needed anything from him. :: He routinely asked us about what we were doing and made us question how we were to proceed. :: Mr. Hance consistently emphasized understanding the base concepts of the current topic.  If there were questions or confusion on the topic at hand, he made answered questions in class or made himself available outside of class time to ensure we had a proper understanding of the topics discussed in class."
648,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Well. :: He communicated well verbally, through email, and the discussion board. :: Very effectively. On the daily we will receive either an email answering a question someone had or by using the discussion board on Pilot. He is very effective and engaged in communicating to the students. :: Very good, He would allows take time out his schedule to help us. :: He communicated very effectively using the discussion board and email. :: Very effective using Pilot discussion board. :: He did a good job posting on Pilot any changes. :: He was effective. :: Mr. Hance communicated through email, the pilot website, and in person."
649,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, all of his lectures followed that of the syllabus unless we got behind in a previous class but he would always get caught up in order to cover the desired material for the day. :: Yes. :: Yes, we knew the schedule was fluid but the lectures were still well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the schedule was clearly communicated prior to the start of the course.  Mr. Hance wrote the specific outline for each class on the whiteboard before each class began."
650,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, during Dennis's office hours, he would always be in his office and available to talk. Along with emails, he would respond within a few hours typically. :: Yes, always responded to us very fast no matter what time it was. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was available throughout the day, including during hours which were not designated as official office hours.  Mr. Hance responded to emails within a day and even after campus was closed (i.e. after 8 pm)."
651,Dennis Hance,2018 Spring,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Dennis is a great professor who knows the material, puts forth extra effort, and genuinely cares about the students' education. :: Dennis Hance is a very important asset to the Wright State University Lake Campus. Without him and his dedication to his students the program would not be where it is today. :: Dennis does a good overall job and I really believe he hopes for the success of his students. Sometimes I think he makes students feel like they are not doing a good job or enough work when they are doing more than enough for a required task. I believe he does this just to push everyone to do the best they can do, but the methodology isn't always the most motivational. :: Good work. :: No. :: Mr. Hance is a firm, but fair instructor.  He seems to be an instructor looking to increase the professionalism and accountability of his students.  It is clear one of his goals as director of engineering is to further improve the standards of the Lake Campus to solidify its reputation as one of Ohio's foremost schools."
652,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- poor he taught to the PhD level instead of the undergrad level. :: Fairly effective. Would like to see more sample problems during class. :: He is excellent in teaching all practical applications. :: very good helps to learn the material in a very better way. :: He is for sure knowledgeable.
653,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes
654,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes
655,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he didnt. :: Would give extra credit if you could find a mistake in his work. Would check in with you personally to see how well you're doing. :: Explaining about all the practical cases in detail. :: he used to give extra questions as a part of us to increase intrest in class. :: He makes himself available to listen to your questions and answers them to your satisfaction
656,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: Yes. :: good. :: very well. :: Very well
657,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- no his lectures were scrambled. :: Could be a little quicker on grades but otherwise good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes
658,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
659,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- he knows his stuff however, he can not teach down to others. :: His teaching methods are really good. :: His questions are too conceptual and sometimes difficult to understand, he should make his examinations a little more close to student comprehension."
660,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- A great lecturer, extremely easy to follow along with the textbook as the lecture usually follows its rough structure within chapters. Tests are challenging because of the large amount of information covered by the two exams. Critical thinking is required and you are expected to keep pace. I do appreciate this type of teaching as these are the classes where I actually learn content. :: Fairly effective. :: Effective at teaching concepts. :: In this course, he was very clear and easy to learn from. :: Very effective, he was available a lot for questions and he was very thorough"
661,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. How extra credit is awarded is a bit abstract however. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the expectations were known and followed. :: yes"
662,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Full class period used, sometimes several minutes late but uses class time wisely. :: Yes. :: Showed up late a few times. :: He was pretty regular about starting on time and using the full class period. We could've probably gone even longer :). :: yes"
663,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- We spent roughly half the semester engaged in projects based on previous skills learned through computational methods. We had work time in class where we could be engaged with Dr. Farajian about our projects. Great guidance was offered during these projects. :: Would work alongside you on projects if there were difficulties. :: Yes. :: He was very helpful and involved in each students learning process. The small class size helped a bit in this area, but he was extremely useful in this class. :: He would be open to meet outside of class and would reply to emails very quickly. He was generally interested in how we felt like we were doing in the class."
664,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication effective inside of classroom. Sometimes unclear on assignments, especially expectations for the projects up until the end of the semester. :: Yes. :: Quite well. :: He communicated well in and out of the classroom. He stayed late on days to help students out with questions and used email effectively. :: very well"
665,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, it is based on a small amount of difficult content. Limited homework, two tests, 1 project with paper and presentation. :: Yes. :: They were a little scattered but informative. :: The course content and lectures were well organized. He knew the material well and helped the students to know it better. :: yes"
666,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, although I did not request appointments or take advantage of office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, as described in previous question, he was helpful in his office, after class, and through email. :: yes"
667,Amir Farajian,2018 Spring,ME 4830,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Projects were expected to be worked on outside of class but exactly how much work was required to complete the project successfully was unclear. Projects were not expected to work but results of some kind were expected. My project in particular had a hard time coming together in the end and it was unclear whether this was due to our group not doing enough research outside of class or just having a more complex structure to model. If I could redo that project I would use more organization to keep track of the simulations and have somethings running constantly. Considering that limited simulations ran for up to a week of time it is unclear how large of a system we should have been shooting for and this led to some disarray within the group and with the instructor on project goals. :: I really enjoyed this class. The project was an interesting way to get to know the softwares that we were using. I enjoy learning through applications. Even though there was some theory, the majority of the class was hands on learning which is very helpful in industry. :: no"
668,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- 1. :: Good instructor, just wish the material for the exams was given better. :: very effective. :: Okay. :: she was not effective and over complicated the material. she never explained why we used certain variables in some equations and others in different equations. she was not good at all. :: ok. :: Quite effective. Does a good job of conveying material, doing in-class practice, & testing us on what's most necessary. However, she grades more harshly than most professors and I wish she would give us a little more in-class practice to prepare us for the exams. :: Good teacher. :: Effective. :: Dr. Hong Huang is very kind, and answers questions when asked. Overall, I like her, but there are a few things I believe she could do better on. I will list suggestions in additional comments section of this survey. :: Sometimes things were not made perfectly clear which netted some confusion. Homework and quizzes were for the most part ""pop"". It was hard to really form a routine in the class as we could go weeks without a quiz or homework. :: good. :: okay. :: she explained in details and assigned a good assignment. :: We learned formulas and how to use them pretty effectively. There was a written part on every test and that's what was harder for me. She rushed trough explaining the concepts most of the time. It was hard to know which concepts were more important or more relevant to this course.  During lectures she would show us the formulas we needed, but sometimes she didn't have written down each thing meant on the formulas. I referred to the book instead. Once she had a different formula and she called it the same thing that the book called a different formula. that made things confusing. She changed her formula subscript later.  It was hard to keep up during lectures because she went really fast. She posted her power points on pilot but during the lecture she usually gave out more information, and she often moved to the next slide before I could finish writing stuff down. She would usually ask if the information was clear but she wouldn't wait for a response, she just kept moving on the lecture. When people did as questions it seemed rushed. It wasn't like this at the start of the semester. I think she was trying to cover as much material as possible before the end of the semester"
669,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- 2. :: Not bad. :: yes. :: Yes. :: no, it seemed like she made up her own criteria as she went along and didn't explain why a problem was wrong and didn't explain how to fix my mistakes. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part, yes. The syllabus implies we would have more quizzes, since they are worth 15% of the grade, but so far, we have only had 3. I think we will have a fourth by the end of the semester, but only 4 quizzes being 15% of the grade seems to be a bit much. The quizzes have no warning besides in class, so if you miss a day, you may unknowingly lose a few percent points on your final grade because you missed a quiz. :: Homework and exams were hard to make out what was incorrect. Answers that were incorrect would have a slash but no correct answer or specific part marked incorrect. Was hard to fix mistakes for the future with this. :: kind of. 15% of our grade is based off of pop quizzes and we only had three, each averaging about 5 questions. This was a little misleading. :: yes. :: She did for the tests and the homework. Quizzes were worth 15% but we didn't have any until later in the semester"
670,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- 3. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Hong Huang always started class on time, and would almost always use the entire class time lecturing or answering questions. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, she always did even if they were some computer issues"
671,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- 4. :: No, the material was very bland and was elaborated on. :: she always made sure that every student understood. :: Tests and quizzes. :: She did not. she was extremely hard to understand and moved through the notes so fast that i barely had the title of the slide down before she moved onto the next subject. she moved way too fast and never went back to clarify anything she ""taught"". :: yes. :: She gave us in-class practice for a variety of topics and with a few exceptions, her tests covered the material taught in class. :: yes, always checking to make sure students can hear her. :: It did not seem like there was much interest in student learning. I am sure she wants the class to learn, but the notes were very rushed and many students were very confused on the material. I believe there could be more effort and consideration in this area. :: Dr. Huang definitely wanted us to succeed, and helped as much as she could. She tried hard to make sure everyone could see what she was writing, and why. :: Yes. When the class did poorly she seamed concerned. :: No answer. :: she progressed at a steady state. :: I don't have a particular anecdote for this but she did mention she would be available for questions over email and office hours."
672,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- 5. :: Well. :: well. :: Emails. :: she didn't communicate well at all, when in office hours she would give an example or two and when you asked for help she basically ignored you. :: well. :: Very well. :: often with email updates. :: Somewhat effectively. :: She communicated fairly well both in and outside of the classroom. There were a few times she could not understand what a student was asking, and we had to repeat the question or rephrase it a few times for her to understand the exact question. Other than that, her communication was good. :: Well. :: Inside the classroom certain things were unclear because she did not explain what things pertained too, or would go too quickly. Wasnt completely sure what was going on be excluded from one of the exams because she was going too fast. :: very effectively. :: She sent out emails every time a class assignment or review material for the class was posted on pilot."
673,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- 5. :: Yes. :: sort of. :: Yes. :: no. :: no. :: Yes. She clearly knows what she's talking about. :: Some information was not well expressed in powerpoints and explanations were quick and hard to follow. :: The content seemed very organized. The lecturing of the content was rushed. :: I believe the lectures were organized, but the lecture slides on pilot could be organized a bit better. :: Lectures were quite boring at times. More examples were definitely needed as the class routinely just followed a powerpoint with little examples to real applications and problems. :: not entirely. the slides were often confusing and some had incorrect information that she said she needed to switch. the process was organized i.e. lecture, practice problems, lecure etc. :: yes. :: The lectures were well organized. The quizzes were not since we only completed about 3 and they are worth 15%. One of the quizzes she didn't prepare beforehand and she was dictating the questions at the end of the class. On a different time she started the quiz just a few minutes before the end of class. I know this affected people who have class right after."
674,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- 6. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I'm not sure. I did not really communicate with this professor outside of class. :: I never had to go to her during office hours or make an appointment, so I would not know that part. She was always available right after lecture was over and responded well to questions on her own time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: I wasn't able to go to office hours due to my schedule, but she mentioned she would be available multiple times."
675,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- 7. :: Fire this professor, i didn't pay the collage to teach myself this material. It was her job to teach the material and she failed at that task quite miserably. :: Great professor, just needs to consider altering the lecture style a little. :: This class seemed to be the first time Dr Huang had to use a projector to display her hand-written work. Sometimes she went too fast between the slides and her hand-written work, and we could not get an entire example written down. It would be nice if she would put her in-class examples on pilot, so that we can always go back to it if we did not get the example written down quick enough or wrote something wrong by accident. Having it on pilot would also be nice, because we would not have to disrupt the lecture to get notes down, and she would be able to go a little faster without any worry. :: slides should have solutions for the students to reference, or the lecture should be slowed down so students can at least write down information from the sides that are not in print. Often times there would be a sudden switch in the slides and the correct answers couldnt be recorded (a lot of the time a student would request to go back in the slides, which helped). :: keep up the good work. :: She is really smart and very knowledgeable. I just had a hard time keeping up during class."
676,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- She was very effective. :: good. :: Very effective professor, I learned a lot from her and it was clear she knew what she was teaching. :: Great instructor"
677,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes, work was graded as expected and assignments were provided as per the syllabus. Everything was laid out very well. :: yes"
678,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes, we didn't go a day where the time wasn't used to it's full potential."
679,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She showed us good exampled. :: good explanations. responded quickly. always helpful. :: She used a lot of interesting topics as well as software that allowed us to apply what we were learning. :: Yes a lot
680,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well and she was very courteous and helpful if something needed re scheduled due to conflict outside of school. :: good. :: She was very available both in and out of class. :: Great, always has good email communication"
681,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the class was very well organized. :: Yes"
682,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. very good response time. :: Yes, she answered emails fairly quickly and was always open to students coming in to office hours. :: Yes"
683,Hong Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Very good professor, I would definitely take a course with her again. :: This class has so much to offer a material science and engineering student. This needs to be more credit hours as well as more hands with data analysis. This course should almost take the place of mechanical testing lab for materials students and make it into 2 separate classes with a lab and lecture and getting to use all the scopes availiable as wright as well as using the mechanical testing equipment like in mechanical testing lab."
684,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not very effective, expects students to understand concepts without any examples or homework to reinforce concepts; only two homework were given the entire semester. :: Not very. She seems scatterbrained when going through a subject. She will start writing something on the board and halfway through will change her mind and erase it. The course also had two textbooks and several handouts posted on pilot; however, half the time she would move from one to another without announcing it, it took a week for me and the student next to me to figure out that we had moved from chapter 7 on the main book to chapter 11 in the same book (which wasn't on the syllabus to be covered). :: Not very effective, She was under the impression we had a much stronger back ground in the required material. :: Very effective and efficient. :: This course took much more time with self study than usual but I do felt like a learned a great deal. :: good. :: Average."
685,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: I believe so. :: Everything was graded on an unknown grading scale so I have no idea what is required of me to pass the class. After the exams she would give a grade range of what would be an A vs what would be a B and it would change each time. Then we were told those weren't really our grades they were a reference so we knew where we were at. :: Yes she did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Nope
686,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, she always made use of her time. :: Yes she used to be in class 5 minutes prior only!!!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes"
687,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- I don't believe she did. :: yes. :: Yes she seemed very passionate, she just overestimated our base knowledge. :: She used to relate the topics and examples solved in class to real time concepts. :: I appreciated that Dr. Mukhopadhyay held office hours in the evening for an evening class. :: good. :: Okay"
688,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- She would respond to emails in a timely manner. In class concepts were sometimes confusing to follow; especially when she would changes variables being used to signify one thing in the middle of the explanation. :: She was good with outside communications, but overall could be somewhat vague. For our project she told us that more details on what she was expecting were in the syllabus. All the syllabus said was and I quote, ""TERM PAPER: Students will be required to present a term paper describing the energy aspects of a modern application or process. Examples include energy conversion, thermodynamic models, renewable energy materials, chemical reactions etc. These are examples only, and any additional area of interest to the student can be discussed with the instructor. Students are welcome to team up with classmates to present different aspects of the same topic."" Which sounds like it should be a paper (of indeterminate length) and a presentation on the paper, but it was merely a 5 minute powerpoint presentation to the class that was worth 15% of our grade. :: Pretty effectively. :: She was so helpful boosting up the confidence. :: I was usually able to follow the class notes after reviewing the same material in textbooks once or twice. The supplemental material and example problems posted on pilot were a good addition to the textbooks. Dr. Mukhopadhyay was also quick to respond to emailed questions. :: good. :: okay"
689,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not at all. :: Nope. Felt very disorganized, with no coherent train of thought between topics. Also she would be going through something and want us to work through a problem, but then she would keep lecturing while we thought we were supposed to be working through a problem (which wasn't always very well defined) so we didn't know what to be paying attention to at such points in class. :: Yes. :: Perfectly organized. :: I would have liked to see specific pages or sections to be covered in the syllabus so I could read the material before lectures. The sequence of topics of the course was well organized. :: yes. :: okay"
690,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I guess. :: Yes she was often in her office. :: Yes she was available at office hours and on emails too. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes"
691,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7500,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The structure of the class needs to be seriously reconsidered. The entirety of the overall grade is based off of six total grades: 2 homeworks, 2 test, a presentation, and final. In my opinion that is not a sufficient amount of work to create an entire grade. :: Should use pilot for grades. :: Overall learning thermodynamics with her was a great  experience, learned quite an amount from her. :: There was a big gap between where I left off an undergrad and where the course started with the Carey textbook. I had to spend a significant amount of time finding and reviewing other sources outside of the course material to come up to speed on quantum mechanics. The Swallin textbook was easier to follow from the start. I would have like to work more example problems and/or homework problems for this material. Ideally at least one for every concept covered. I feel like I'm just moving symbols around with derivations unless I have applied the concept to a problem once or twice. The exams were moderately difficult but fair. :: no. :: Her classes are okay"
692,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective at giving the general outline of what the information is. :: Okay. :: shes good. :: Very effective. :: Very effective. :: The professor was good at keeping the class engaging and maintaining focus. The grading was fair and the exams were a good representation of the material covered in the class. Overall a great teacher and one of my most enjoyable classes that I have taken. :: She is an amazing instructor with vast knowledge about the course and helps with study guide needed for exam preparation.
693,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- The syllabus shows the percentage that each of the parts of the class are, but the way that the grading is does not much sense. :: Yes. :: yup. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Evaluations seemed fair and straight forward. :: Yes"
694,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yup. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Classes always started and ended right on time. :: Absolutely
695,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She would allow office hours and would be willing to meet after class as well as address our questions in class. :: Yes. :: she helped in office hours. :: Lots of in-class example problems, connecting course material to concepts learned in other class, connecting course material to practical/real-world examples. :: Asked questions to make sure everyone understood. :: The professor always tried to connect class topics to research that she knew students were working to give perspective to the topics. :: By answering questions about things that were unclear to me."
696,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: Okay. :: well. :: Very effectively. :: Very effectively, with emails as well as updates during lectures. :: Communication was fine except for access to grades during the semester. She did not post individual exam and homework grades to pilot, making it more difficult to keep track of how well I doing in the class throughout the semester. :: Very Good."
697,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- some were very organized some were not. :: Lectures were a little disorganized at times. :: yup. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the lectures and slides followed a clear outline of the topics covered in the class. :: To a reasonable extent."

699,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Spring,ME 7780,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I wish you would have done example problems completely during class so it was easier to understand. Also i think we should have had more than one homework assignment so that we could have a better understanding of how to do the problems on exams. I would have also liked it if you had posted grades in Pilot. :: nope. :: Great class- I learned a lot of new things and improved my understanding of some things I had seen before. :: She is a great instructor."

716,Mark Johnson,2018 Spring,ME 3360,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He cares about your learning. :: I thought Mark did an excellent job this semester. :: l. :: Good. :: Mark is a very knowledgeable professor with any subject he teaches. He can effectively convey the subject in a way that the students can understand. :: Professor Johnson is a very good professor who genuinely cares about the success of his students. :: Very effective.
717,Mark Johnson,2018 Spring,ME 3360,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: l. :: Good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Professor Johnson evaluated my work exactly based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: Yes
718,Mark Johnson,2018 Spring,ME 3360,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: l. :: Good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Professor Johnson routinely started class on time and used the full class period to lecture about course material and to answer and questions students may have had. :: Yes
719,Mark Johnson,2018 Spring,ME 3360,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He made us go up the board and work out problems which I thought helped a lot. :: l. :: Good. :: Mark is readily available to answer questions and is more than willing to assist students in any way he can. :: Professor Johnson would ask for questions many times during class and also challenge students to see if they were understanding the course material. :: Answered questions.
720,Mark Johnson,2018 Spring,ME 3360,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: l. :: Good. :: Very well. Students were always informed on what was happening and what was expected. :: Professor Johnson communicated in and out of the classroom very well. :: Very well.

724,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- In the class, the professor did not do an exceptional job of teaching the students the material. During most classes he would go through slide shows and example problems too quickly. Students wouldn't have enough time to write down the answers to try to understand either. Processes on how to solve problems were not given. If some questions were asked he would refer to the book and say that one could find the equations there. This did not help in understanding the material, considering the book does a better job of defining terms and not describing how to solve problems. :: Alle Jackson is a committed teacher and one of the most caring ones I have had at this university.  He wants his students to succeed and goes out of his way to facilitate their learning while also maintain standards and requirements.  He isn't a push over.  He is always ready to help you learn the material but that isn't to say he is ready to just pass you through either. :: not at all. :: Not effective at all. :: Dr. Jackson overall is an effective instructor. 4/5. Lectures are well prepared for in advanced however I would suggest either slowing down on the PowerPoint presentations of making sure all slides are up before lecture. Did okay with trying to make sure they were up before hand but it was not an occurrence every time. :: Lectures were quite dysfunctional. :: . :: Allen jackson should not be a teacher any more, he has lost his ability to teach with age. :: needs some work. :: Dr Jackson is one of the nicest professors I've ever met. However he is easily the worst professor I've had. He doesn't communicate concepts very well, and rushes through problems too fast. I would not advise anyone to take this class with Dr Jackson. :: The instructor seems to get very off topic, tries to relate what he's talking about to the lecture but that does very little for my mathematical understanding of the subject (which is what I'm evaluated on). :: Not effective at all. Did not help my learning whatsoever and made it harder to learn at times. Definitely could be better"
725,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- The instructor followed the syllabus but was a harsh grader on exams and material. On exams, he did not grade on a student's ability to perform the right process of the problems but instead if they could get the right mathematical value. With a single math error, irrational amounts of points were docked from the grade. He followed the syllabus but also made it hard to succeed in the class based on how he graded. :: He was very fair with his evaluations of the course work.  His expectations were clear throughout the semester. :: yes. :: Very hard grader, made up his own problems on exams, but worded them terribly enough that many people failed. :: Exactly as presented. :: Yes. :: . :: The syllabus, instructions, and his actual grading do not match at all.  The class is not well define in any way shape or form. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Kind of. The course seems so sporadic in the sense that we never really knew what was coming next. We might skip over things that were then on the test or we might cover things that we didn't need to know."
726,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The instructor always used the full lab and class periods to teach the material. :: He often adjusted his time especially on Thursdays to best accommodate his students.  Though he may adjust the time he didn't waste his time and always lectured for the full amout. :: yes. :: yes, he even lectured during the lab periods which was absolutely awful, we ended up lecturing from 2:30 to 6:10, great idea. :: Yes, very consistent. :: Yes. :: . :: Class was on time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: YES. :: Yes"
727,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor demonstrated interest in my learning by being available during office hours and answering questions during class. He seemed willing to help if it was possible to do. :: Often he would meet outside his standard office hours to help me personally. I can only assume that he did that with all his students that needed help.  He was very understanding of working students as well and attempted to make himself available to them and help them through there difficult schedule. :: asked lots of questions. :: He was helpful one on one with questions. :: The labs were probably the number one peak of interest. I do think they could do a little more to involve real world scenarios like the strain gage lab. Maybe try doing a little more with explaining how the subjects relate to the real world. Still did a good job with it. :: Yes. :: . :: He involves students well. :: gave use real world examples. :: Dr. Jackson was very easy to approach and his door was always open even if it wasn't during his office hours. However, I rarely got much help from talking to him as he can't communicate concepts well at all. :: always was available for questions. :: I couldn't tell. He basically said you need to know this or else. He didn't care in our ability to solve problems because he blew over them and only talked about it for a few minutes. Honestly, this part pissed me off. We were expected to do these types of problems on the exam, but he barely even showed us how to solve them. For example, he may throw an example on the board BEFORE showing the lecture from that section. Then he would stand there for 10 minutes to ""let us work on the problem."" Obviously, no body knows what to do. This severely affected my performance on the exams."
728,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The professor was easily contacted through email and in his office hours. He was always available. :: He was pretty timely in all responses however the one critique I have for him his a more structured lecture and communication on practice problems.  He is a great guy and ready to help and tries his best but the teaching style isn't that sound at least for me. :: good with email. :: Didn't post hw to pilot, only mentioned it in class, so if you missed class, you wouldn't know what the hw was. :: Very well! Always willing to take the time to talk in and out of the class which helped a lot! Keep it up!. :: Relatively good communicator. :: . :: good. :: Horribly. The class as a whole was almost always confused by what he was saying. I learned little to nothing from this class. :: available through email and was always responsive. :: Decent"
729,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course was decently organized based on the fact that he had presentations prepared and review problems selected. He was organized and prepared, but did not do a great job of explaining the material. :: The provided slides and lectures could be more organized to the point that they are easier to understand and provides more information.  He could probably save himself so work with one on ones if his lectures and his slides had more structured information. :: yes. :: Hardly. :: Pretty well organized just went through the PowerPoints fairly quickly. :: It felt a little unorganized at times. :: . :: No, the course content and lectures are awfully organized and structured.  This class needs a huge overhaul or a new instructor. :: ok not bad. :: Not at all. The lectures were more akin to ramblings and he did a terrible job of communicating and connecting concepts. :: yes. :: Not at all. It was all over the place and hard to understand. He puts the PowerPoints online only sometimes and he often blows through them at a blistering speed. Going to lecture was a waste of time because even if you tried to pay attention in class, he would go off on a tangent or go through the lecture at 5 seconds per slide."
730,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor was always available when I needed to meet up with him. :: yes always. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes!. :: Never had to go to office hours. :: . :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Decently well"
731,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 3600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Overall, the professor provided information on the class topics, however he needs to work on explaining how to solve the problems. He needs to slow down and go through the problems step by step instead of just showing the book answers. His method does not allow students to understand the material or even the time to write down the example problems to teach themselves the material later. For labs, it would be helpful if he could somehow go through the lab setup with the students. Having the labs prepared to be used would aid in saving time and allowing the possibility of finishing the lab within the lab period. Furthermore, I did not like how extra points were rewarded during class. At some points , he would reward exceptional amounts of extra credit to someone or a table that finished a problem first in class. I think is an unfair way to give extra credit. Some students do not understand material or work out problems as fast as others. Just because they are slower to perform, does not mean that they are not deserving of the points. The awarding of extra credit in this manner, frustrated me for the fact that I felt cheated  of extra points based on if I could work at a faster speed. I think it should be considered of offering extra credit assignments to the whole class and the students choose if they would like to do the work for the extra points or not. This way, everyone has an equal opportunity for points, if they wish to obtain them: the extra credit is not based on a speed or knowledge game. :: One of the better teachers as far as his attitude and willingness to help students however his teaching style may be a little outdated and his lectures and slides need an overhaul. :: nice guy. seems confused by the material he's supposed to be teaching to us. :: He teaches from a powerpoints, but doesn't post them to pilot before class so we can't follow along during class, he also goes through the slides too fast so we can't always get the equations we need written down. The speed wouldn't be a problem if we could view the slides from pilot. The test problems should be more similar to the book. The only study material was from the book, but the exam questions were well beyond the questions in the book. He's a nice guy and has a potential to be a really good prof. He just needs to post his slides earlier, and give more concise fair exam problems. :: For a difficult subject to teach I think Dr. Jackson did a very good job. I would suggest trying to get one or two teaching assistants for lab times if possible. I would also consider changing the book up mainly because the book did not do the greatest with explaining certain concepts and had several typos. Overall Dr. Jackson did a very good job and I am happy I took him. :: . :: Allen jacksons handwriting is illegible, he cannot explain the labs or homework problems in a way that is easy to learn or even understand, and he has forgotten or cannot remember basics necessary when talking about engineering. :: less theory talk and more examples done by hand. :: Dr. Jackson is clearly an expert in his field, but he cannot teach this material at all. I would not recommend anyone take this class with this man. :: For the love of god, something has to be done about the book and the problems. I recommend statistics being a pre-req for this class. The way it was taught in class was just abysmally bad. I had no idea how statistics work and I honestly still don't know how they work. It was so poorly taught in both lecture and in the book. Absolutely repulsive. The only reason I am doing decent in the rest of the class is because I have seen the material before. If you were brand new to this, then I wish you the best of luck because you WILL NOT do well."
732,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson is very effective. :: He did a good job of explaining the concepts behind the labs, how to do the labs, and what our findings meant. :: At times what Dr. Jackson was looking for from the labs could be unclear. :: Dr. Jackson and his TA staff are very effective in making this a seamless class. The only improvement would be more clarity with the schedule of lab groups. :: Laid out The lab instructions clearly with clear expectations. :: Alright, could have been better. The content and especially the schedule seemed kinda chaotic for a class that has been taught multiple times."
733,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes
734,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Usually. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, when applicable."
735,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes. :: When he noticed that some of the data I included in a report looked wrong, he let me know so that I could fix it. :: N/a. :: Always willing To answer questions and was easily available. :: Answered questions regarding the labs"
736,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Yes. :: He did a good job of keeping us informed. :: N/a. :: Good. :: Good
737,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: N/a. :: Yes. Everything easily found on pilot. :: What was provided in the content was good, however, it didn't always cover what was desired, making it hard to adequately complete tasks. For example, the tensile test lab had a very specific procedure to obtain results that was not intuitive and not explained in the material, making it difficult to correctly obtain the desired results. Other times, the hands off approach caused similar problems."
738,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Not always.  I once e-mailed him with a question about a report, and he did not respond until three days later, right before it was due. :: N/a. :: Yes always there when I needed him. :: Yes"
739,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I would have expected better overall organization of the class after teaching it multiple times. The hands off teaching method and turning us loose on the labs with only minimal instruction on equipment use did not match the methodical data interpretation required from many of the labs. This was made worse by the lack of updated material in the lab manuals. Since this is meant to teach multiple testing procedures, I felt it would have been better to start each lab with a lecture to not only go over the lab and equipment procedures, but to also cover more material on the test, uses, and data collected as well to further expand our knowledge of the test, instead of just being turned loose on it. The overly flexible schedule was annoying as well, especially when groups wouldn't show up because they didn't think it was their turn and then nobody would know who had gone and who hadn't. A more rigid schedule outlining not only the order and days of labs, but what groups were going on what days would have helped cut down on confusion and conflict between groups trying to do the same lab at once."
740,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Was effective in communicating what the labs meant to students. Also was clear on what was expected in each report. :: good. :: yes. :: Very helpful with answering questions about the labs as well as explaining the various testing procedures performed.
741,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.
742,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.
743,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Made sure to communicate his concerns with mistakes in reports and made sure students understood what was going on. :: yes. :: Dr. Jackson made it clear that he was always available to talk with if students had questions regarding the experiments.
744,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Held regular office hours and answered questions via email. :: good. :: Responded quickly to e-mails and was always available for questioning during class time.
745,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.
746,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
747,Allen Jackson,2018 Spring,ME 4620,Question 8,0
748,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- For someone who never had Dr. Huang before this class, his teaching can catch you off guard. However, once you get used to his style you learn very quickly. Dr. Huang was able to explain fluids simple enough for someone like me who is on the design track and was only exposed to fluid dynamics. :: Professor Huang is effective. I have learned much in this class. It is a difficult topic and Professor Huang is teaching it the best he can. :: Well, I can easily say that Dr. Huang is one of the most knowledgeable instructors that I have ever experienced in the fluid dynamics side of Mechanical Engineering, if not the most knowledgeable. His conceptual understanding of what it takes to perform Viscous Flow calculations using known methods that have been developed over time, as well as the conversion of simple Fluid Dynamic equations is astounding. However, his lack of supplemental material does make the course incredibly challenging to all of the students partaking. Additionally, his evaluation of student knowledge is a little undeveloped as the only grades for the course come from 4-separate exams. Is he an effective teacher? Depends on the day of the week. Though his English is well developed, his process of ""bridging"" the understanding of the material by his students to his own understanding needs some improvement. :: Very effective. Gave clear examples that required additional effort to perform well on exams (though all necessary information was clearly presented). :: Very good."
749,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: He did very well. :: Technically, yes. He did evaluate our work based on the expectations of the course syllabus. Whether or not I agree with these expectations is an entirely different story. :: Yes. :: Yes."
750,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Everyday and the whole period. :: Yes and yes. Every class session tended to last the entire time period and started promptly at or before the indicated start of the class period. :: Yes. :: Yes.
751,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Huang would routinely ask if anyone had questions and give a thorough explanation until the students understood the topic. :: Professor Huang has increased my interest in learning. :: He regularly answered questions regarding the information of this course for students, and explained the methods used to develop each of the equations defined in the course presentations (all which were made by the instructor). Hell, his research has focused on this information for the past 20+ years, so I'm not surprised he has a strong interest for the course material. :: Called on people in class to demonstrate their understanding of homework problems, went over homework problems people were having trouble with. :: Very good."
752,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Huang would alert us of any changes in class or through email. :: Professor Huang communicated very well in and out of the classroom. I always knew what was going on. :: In class, there was definitely a disconnect between the instructor and the students. Not always, but I'd say a decent amount of the time. This is primarily due to the lack of information regarding the variables used in the determined equations, as well as the looks of confusion on each of the faces across the classroom. Though not many questions were asked in the class, that's not to say that students understood what was being said. I found myself regularly confused, and could not determine how to form my questions for the instructor at the time that they were being asked for.  Out of class, the instructor had regular office hours where he made himself available for consultation. :: Effectively. :: Very good."
753,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, for this course everything is built off of one another so once you understand the basics the rest will come. :: It is as organized as it can be. :: He did build up the course content in a way that made logical sense. However, the lecture material was presented so rapidly that if you were not present for a class session, you would be rightfully confused on how to correctly perform the required calculations. :: yes. :: Yes."
754,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: He was very available, but I should have used that option more than I did. :: Yes, if you needed to speak with the professor. Each time I went to his office hours, he was always available for consultation. :: yes. :: Yes."
755,George Huang,2018 Spring,ME 4350,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- It was refreshing to have a passionate professor like Dr. Huang. If I was not graduating I would love to have another class with him. As a design track student there were times where I simply did not know of a common constant or concept, but that did not impact my overall learning. :: I would like to thank Professor Huang for a great semester. :: Dr. Huang teaches his course at a Master's level which is something that I greatly admire. However, the lack of additional practice grades for this course and supplemental material (up until the last chapter taught) makes the processes hard to follow at every step. I feel sorry for some of the undergraduate students in this class that have a lesser knowledge of flow characterization processes, for I would not see myself capable of performing some of the calculations without the understanding I currently have for fluid processes. :: no. :: No."
756,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- A lot of the content was important and useful information during class, but unfortunately, most of the content covered in class was not very helpful for the homework and projects assigned each week.  Overall, Dr. Camberos is an enthusiastic and eager to help us learn. :: Fairly effective. Lectures were a bit lacking as far as demonstrating application of concepts. :: More effective at explaining topics that were not relevant to the specific assignment of the week. :: Very effective. :: He is very knowledgeable about the subject but did not always explain things well enough for a beginner. He provided a lot of references that help aid the learning but it is not an independent study course. I felt like I had to do it all on my own. :: Very EFFECTIVE!! Really understands the material presented and was able to present it so that it was more easily understood. Provided a library list of references which enabled the student to fill in any educational background voids that he or she may have and/or expand his/her knowledge base, especially in the area of mathematic techniques. Provided an excellent soft copy set of notes that were covered in detail during the lectures as well as multiple set of matlab codes. Very educational. :: Very good. :: Itâs good. :: He is very friendly with students, helping student for their work, and conducting classes on time. But his teaching style needs to improve. Presently he is reading the notes in class which he has made in terms of presentation. Instead, if he will derive the equations and talk in deep about concepts that will be more helpful. :: Overall, quite effective."
757,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes; although when writing reports for our projects, it would be helpful to have feedback on at least one before finishing all of them.  He didn't get to grading any of the five projects until after they had all been turned in.   I would prefer to have slightly less detailed feedback in a timely manner than extremely detailed feedback at the end of the semester before I can apply the feedback. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus well. :: Yes, he was just really slow to grade it. :: YES. No Complaints at all. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
758,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- He always started on time, but almost always went over class time, sometimes up to a half an hour. :: More or less. Rarely late to lecture, occasionally late to lab time (not scheduled through the university anyway). Classes very frequently went very far over scheduled ending time, forcing some to leave before lecture was completely finished. :: He would always start on time and a majority of the time would go 15 to 20 minutes over the full class period; the longest that we went over was 30 minutes. :: Yes always started on time and often ran over. :: Yes, we went over the time limit almost every class. :: Always on time.  Stayed after class to help any students who were interested enough to ask for or needed help. Held weekly practice labs which were not on the schedule and did so on his own time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
759,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He was always very eager to answer questions and really wanted you to understand; during the lab sessions he added he was always willing to help you work through your homework and questions. :: Usually made himself available via email. :: He added a extra lab time on Friday afternoons to attempt to help with the weekly assignment. :: Very enthusiastic, gave lots of reference material, always willing to talk about material. :: He was available for consultation after class and made himself available on Fridays to assist with homework or projects. :: Always seemed to be available and would ask if everyone understood the material. Stayed late and held extra labs. Enjoyed getting questions and would take the time to thoroughly answer all of them. :: Very good. :: By projects. :: He will talk about the particular concepts and give more examples. :: Yes."
760,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He addressed all questions asked both in email or in class, sometimes if you emailed a question he would address it in class but the issue would always be addressed fairly quickly. :: Reasonably well. :: He made sure that the class was informed of any changes through email or text. It seemed that whenever there was an extension or some other sort of update it was at a time so close to the time for the assignment to be turned in I had already turned in the assignment I had already submitted the assignment. :: He took a while to respond to emails but was responsive via text. :: Very effective communicator, both in and out of the classroom. Easy to understand. :: Very good. :: Very effective. :: He is doing well. :: Good communication."
761,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- For the final project, it was difficult to find an actual problem statement.  Because the project was variable, I see how that could be difficult in a way, but he doesn't have a very clear problem statement for the final project like he did for the others.  Other than that the course content was well organized. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Very well organized. :: Somewhat. The order things were done worked well, but we spent a lot of time working on the background/basics of Finite Difference methods. Then we jumped rather quickly to advanced, unsteady, 2D problems solved using Finite volume methods. I know we had a limited window and without a good understanding of the background the complex stuff will never make sense, but when that big of a jump is made it doesn't make much sense either. :: The lecture notes, problems and projects were all well organized. Much information was available for the student to be able to accomplish the task at hand and learn multiple techniques to learn the subject matter at hand-CFD. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but I believe that a slightly different class schedule would have been beneficial. I think less time should have been spent in the first portion of the class (analytical solutions of PDE's, etc.), and more time should have been spent on the last portion of the class - especially around the Euler equations."
762,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: reasonable availability online. :: Yes. :: Yes but scheduled an additional lab section and would only show up for half or less of it. :: Few office hours and you had to text him to let him know to check his email otherwise he responded several days later. But during office hours he was helpful. :: The instructor was more than available for the student needs. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
763,Jose Camberos,2018 Spring,ME 7340,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Much of the lecture content seemed to reiterate a lot of what could just as easily be obtained from reading the course text and supplementary information. Greater focus on practical application (i.e. coding, coding process recommendations, etc) where code is not supplied previously would be good for future classes. For many projects, having code supplied previously let people fall into a trap of sorts so that the final project was considerably harder than it could've been if a greater focus was placed on coding at the cost of theory. Workload also occasionally became overly stressful since some important concepts relevant to weekly projects were not presented in detail until a day before the project due date in some cases. If project deadlines were delayed as a result, it would not be done until very close to the due date, making it impossible to ""plan"" around delays. Outside factors like additional classes, research work, and jobs often caused issues in comfortably completing this class's work. I feel a better balance could be struck in class subject ordering such that more time is given to completing projects. This problem could have been an issue with this class in particular due to delays earlier in the semester. The time issues may have also been mostly affecting me only due to being in the 4+1 program. In which case, direct discontent toward the 4+1 program instead of the class. :: The few times that the professor had to be out of class for traveling he attempted to hold a Skype or phone call class; this was extremely ineffective if you are unable to make it to the class period it would be more helpful to upload the necessary information to pilot and then have a brief discussion when he returns. Also, it felt like Camberos believed that everyone in his class was only taking his class and doing nothing else; when in fact many other people had other classes they were taking as well as working, I think he needs to become more realistic about the amount of time and work the students can realistically do. :: The work load was a little excessive even for a graduate level class. I could spend 15 hours a week outside of class and still felt like I wasn't able to achieve the minimum expectations. :: When you need to give out references to take the final exam .. it's too hard. :: After 150 undergraduate semester hours and 90 graduate hours, Dr. Camberos is one of the most intelligent instructors that I have ever had the privilege of sitting in his class. Is very knowledgeable of computational fluid dynamics and the associated mathematics required. Look forward to taking another one of his classes. :: No. :: No. :: He need to concentrate more on explaining concepts of CFD, he is just reading notes in class ."

774,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Fall,ME 4120,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- argued with students about missing grades. :: Great teacher. Gives a lot of examples and works through problems carefully and clearly. :: Great teacher. :: The instructor taught the course very well. He had a lot of examples and he knew how to explain them well. He could always answer questions with coordinated responses that made sense and were helpful. The student was always thinking in his class about many different situations presented. Finally he had a good respect for the students and what they thought. :: Sometimes skips steps like he expects you to know what he is talking about. Very knowledgeable but can't always explain it to the students. :: Professor jumps from teaching new material to an example to teaching new material in the middle of the example.. Only to never finish the example before starting another example under some ""what if"" conditioning (such as: what if there was a spring added to node 3). Makes lecture hard to follow. Once, there was confusion by numerous students over what was said in a previous lecture and when their concerns were brought to the teacher's attention, the professor had an ""I'm right, you're wrong"" kind of attitude. Would not listen to student's consensus that the professor was in fact wrong about the subject matter. :: Good lectures and examples. :: Lectures were helpful in learning the subject. Only issue was that classes were sometimes slow-paced. :: Dr. Bae did a very good job with examples and clarity of explanations. One thing I would suggest is to explain the entire process of the problem when adding on to a previous example. :: very good at explanations and examples. giving us his matlab code so we can try on our own was very nice. :: Accent makes him a little hard to understand but it doesn't interfere with his teaching. Treated students well, answered questions clearly, and gave examples for almost every topic. :: Dr. Bae is my favorite professor in the engineering department, he makes his class fun and also by going through the material step by step and doing a lot of examples, he makes the classes so easy. His exams are not easy, but if you study hard and pay attention in class, getting an A in his class and his exams are not a problem. :: Dr. Bae took a lot of time in class going over examples and really strived to ensure everyone knew what was going on. He took a lot of time getting to know people and remembering them by there face. :: his teaching skills are amazing. this is my second class under his guidance and going to take class in next semester too. :: Sir was excellent on his teaching part giving different real life examples which students can easily understand and professor respected all individuals and their thoughts listening out to students quietly and gently replying them. :: Instructor used to explain topics and examples well and in detail. Instructor used to ask questions during lectures which helps in learning a lot as it helps me to think beyond my limits and to find the answer for the questions instructor had asked. Instructor used to solved many examples in class which had helped me to make my concept more clear for this subject. Also instructor respects each individual and used to solved doubts in class. :: Prefer that quizzes cover only material that has had a homework assignment covering it. Its understood that lectures are free game but it's preferable to have spent some time solving prior to being tested over a new subject. :: Good teacher. :: The teacher was always available during office hours and after class for additional questions on the subject and treated everyone fairly. :: Too much Matlab, limit Matlab to the second example of the problem.  Doing it by hand for first example helps to understand what is going on in Matlab. :: Matlab experience. :: he is very good with all of the mentioned aspects. :: Very clear concept and teaching style. excellent explanation. :: pretty good explanation"
775,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Fall,ME 4120,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- focused on matlab even though we where not tested on it. class time was wasted and examples that actual hand calculations where left out in favor of easier to produce but less useful matlab examples. i believe my grade suffered due to these lack of good examples. :: Yes, just works hard to explain the material such that it is easy to understand. :: Yes. Knows his material well. :: The instructor and his notes did a very good job of explaining the subject and how it works. The book was also very good at explaining what needed to be done. :: No. I learned everything from reading the book and following the examples inside it. Lectures were hard to follow and the provided notes from the teacher were next to useless when it came to having to actually do any assignment. :: Good instructions and clarification of material. :: Yes, Dr. Bae helped me to understand the subject. I approached him after class multiple times with questions and he was always willing to give me an answer. :: yes very any question he know the subject very well. :: Helped me with my homework a few times. :: a lot of people told me that FEA is on of the hardest classes in engineering, after taking it with Dr. Bae, i think FEA is one of my favorite classes, Dr. Bae made us understand the material and how does it apply in the real world. :: Yes, he provided a multitude of examples and was always good at answer questions. :: yes. :: Yes Instructor helped me learn and understand the subject as he was always available to clear student doubts. As an example, I use to approach professor during the office hour and he was polite to listen my doubt and clear them immediately. :: Yes absolutely, instructor has helped me a lot to understand this subject well. Instructor used to give time after class for clearing my doubts. Also used to explain each topics in details and used to repeat many times so that I can understand well and can get in depth knowledge of this subject. Due to instructor my interest to learn this subject more in depth has increased. This subject has helped to understand the real world problems and how to solve issues in real world. :: yes, he is happy to work with any random changes to the problem to demonstrate how to solve different problems. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes, the instructor did aid in my understanding of the subject as he helped me understand some of the equations for the homework whenever I was stuck. :: Yes. :: Yes, He is very clear in teaching and making things understandable. He taught the topics with examples, that helped me understand the content more easily. :: Yes he did. :: pretty good explanation"
776,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Fall,ME 4120,Question 13,Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- I feel the class was very fair and taught well so that it could be understood by the student. :: He is one of the better choices of teachers here in ME. :: The only time I ever felt that there was a misunderstanding in class that caused a bad grade was during the first quiz. It was not explained well that you don't always assume it hits wall. :: Sir has ample of knowledge and understanding about the subject and he is very clear with explanation. :: Course structure was also well defined to give clear understanding of this subject. :: Homework before quiz on new topics!!. :: I have no more comments. :: Very good instructor
777,Ha-Rok Bae,2016 Fall,ME 4120,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Great Guy. Very Friendly. But please..Do more problem examples in class!!! and please spend a little more time on writing more clear. I have such a struggle reading your hand writing. And when you do examples please start by stating what we are trying to solve for up front. Maybe even include a real world application. Knowing the real world engineering application of a problem before starting it GRABS our attention. Use less MATLAB...it puts us asleep. Let us know we can use it. But if we cant use it on the exam then whats the purpose. Please do not stop mid problem and solve the rest of a problem in MATLAB. Then my notes are useless. Again, spend a little more time making the HW solutions clear. Some of the Diagrams were very poorly drawn. I would think if 50+ future engineering students are trying to learn a problem you would spend more than 2 seconds on drawing the diagram. Its sad. Im sorry, but its really sad the effort put into some of this class to help the students. If it wasnt for the fact that the book was written so well I probably would fail this class. Take a extra second to make sure the Exam diagrams are clearly stated and drawn.. Is that connection pinned or fixed?..It shows pinned but we were suppose to assume fixed even though it was never stated in the Problem? ring a bell? Just take a little more time to make things clear and you could be one of the top EGR teachers. :: Sometimes the instructor moved very fast through the material. Some of the homework problems where also not clear on which parts of the problem had to be done. :: This class doesn't seem difficult when it gets boiled down to the basics and is explained well but the professor failed in providing a lecture in which the material was given clearly. :: nope. :: no. :: Dr. Bae is the best professor at WSU. :: Dr. Bae was a great professor an I would take him again. :: Overall the instructor teaching was very good. I had learnt many things from  instructor that has helped me to expand my area of knowledge. :: Homework before quiz on new topics!! Didn't like it if it isn't obvious. :: I have no more comments. :: I feel, the questions he set for the exams are a lot more difficult than what he teaches in the class."

I exited this class daily feeling like I had been taught well. :: excellent professor. probably the best I have ever had. very helpful during office hours, respectful and nice. :: Course material was presented in class and then example problems that used the concepts that we taught were done.  The instructor would ask questions to the class regarding the concepts she was teaching.  She was very clear in her explanation of the concepts. :: always provided definitions and explanations of the material before providing example problems which was nice. :: Handled examples very well. :: Good at explaining and plenty of examples and handles questions well and stimulates thought well and gives plenty of respect. :: Great instructor. Taught the class well. Gave great examples that were easy to follow, based on her notes that were used to teach the material. Handled questions fairly well. Sometimes though, she gave wrong formulas and did not include all of the formulas that we needed to successfully complete the homework. Her tests correlated very well with the notes that were given in class and nothing was out of the blue. I believe that the teacher knows and understands the material very well, but there is a bit confusion on things here and there. Overall, an effective rate of 90%. :: Great example problems were worked out in entirety, very respectful professor. :: Dr. Gockel does a good job of avoiding unnecessary information, and the material and exams are straightforward. :: She's very good professor, she gives a lot of notes which is good! But she clears the board quickly before we write sometimes. I think that's because the class is just 55 minutes!!! That's too short for Mech design, and it affects us in the exams. :: Dr Joy was one of my best instructors that i had in wright state. best thing in her notes is there is a good amount of example that will cover the materials that she went through. she is available in the office hours and she response to my emails very fast. :: Please write down the units more on example problems in class. I'll be honest, I sometimes too forget my units. We all do sometimes, but in terms of examples its important becuase its easy to get confused. I think towards the end of the semester you wrote units every time. Other than that you are awesome and funny!. :: Example problems really helped explain the material and were good reference to look back on, always willing to answer questions and make sure material was thoroughly explained to confused students, notes taken in class helped, exams seemed fair and we knew exactly what to prepare for. :: . :: The book we use is 10th edition, it is international stander, but answer use american stander, that caused me confused a lot during study. :: Dr Gockel explained things in depth and very clearly. She used many examples and made sure the class was following along and understanding. :: Revise your notes so there are no mistakes. They ultimately make it into our notes. :: Great professor! Very helpful in and out of class. Gave fair exams with homework and class examples that were relevant. Would be interested in taking another one of her classes. :: She is a great in explaining the material. :: Dr. Gockel was very clear in explaining key information in the subject, she was open to questions and would answer leaving students with a better understanding of the topic. Dr. Gockel was very respectful towards myself and classmates."

Gave real-world examples. :: Yes, example problems given by professor we're very helpful. :: Yes, the classroom instruction and personal study were sufficient. :: Yes. :: Yes, and I enjoyed your side talks about aerospace. :: Yes, always answered questions and tried to clarify to the best of her ability when there was confusion. Didn't try to trip anybody up on exams. :: I didn't looking for help a lot, but when i ask help she helps me a lot. :: I would have liked to have her teach more classes, I learned a lot from her, she was a great teacher, and was one of the best teachers I have had at WSU. :: Yes, projects were a very worth while endeavor. :: Yes, she is giving the example that related to the topic in easy way. :: Yes, Dr. Gockel aided in my understanding of the subject. During our first class project I had several questions and I was able to meet with her during office hours to get a better understanding of the direction my calculations needed to take."

It gives us a break from writing and it gives us an opportunity the stop and just think about whats going on. :: Really enjoyed the design projects as a way to experience ""real"" engineering as opposed to classroom engineering. Really good way to help start the transition to thinking in terms of the whole structure instead of being concerned with certain points like the homework problems do. Also a good way to start thinking about what to consider, what not to, and how to rank considerations, how to chose materials, etc. A really good change from what has been the normal so far. I also really liked the division of points in this class, where it was easier to recover from a bad exam grade having three midterms and the final wasn't worth a ridiculous amount of points more than the midterms. :: Thanks for the great time"

I have a copy of these course notes and she taught word for word off of  those notes. If there was a question that was asked that was not on those notes, she simply could not answer it. As such class time was spent just listening to her read word for word off of the notes. If those notes were provided to students and then students just did examples in the class, it would be a much more useful class. :: The instructor wasn't very helpful in answering questions from the students. The instructor almost never had a complete answer for a student's question and would always push the questions aside for later and would never follow up on them. Also, there wasn't enough explaining behind why things worked or why the material was used the way it was. There was a lack of detail on the material. :: good. :: She did a pretty good job at answering the questions raised by the class. She had plenty of examples to help teach the material. She was very good at making us think about the topics that were being talked about. She had a good respect for the student and always tried to help them understand what was going on. :: had good examples. Helped with doing the hw. :: Everything you learn is copied word for word from the book. You feel like you're wasting your time showing up to class when you know the notes that will be given are straight from the book. :: The class was all just examples and it was hard to relate the problems to real life. Exam problems were way too long but the material in them was fair. Not many people finished the exams. Grading on exams was very random with points taken off for certain things. She is a very nice teacher though just needs some work on exam grading and question choosing. :: Examples were great, it really helps to run through problems in class, especially with all the tables and when some problems require solving for fifteen different things in a single part to find the final solution. Very respectful, knowledgeable professor and professional in the classroom. :: Dr. Gockel was very clear in her notes and lectures, and posed exampled that strongly aided in homework and exams.  She is very respectful to the students. :: Goes through a lot of helpful examples in class. :: Lectures were well-paced and provided examples. Only issue with lectures was that many of the notes were directly from the book. :: It would have helped to have been taught more of the actual theory and applications of the material learned instead of just going by the book and doing examples. Even when we did examples, any questions were usually responded to with ""I don't know, let me check on that"" instead of a clear-cut answer. I could tell she was really trying to do well, but she just needs some more experience teaching the class and a better understanding on how to relay the material. :: she did a good job of teaching this class. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. :: I think she is a fine teacher. :: Gave several examples, answered questions clearly, corrects herself when a mistake is pointed out, and treats students well. Some students might complain that she spends too much time on formulas and not enough about concepts but I think the formulas are just as important. :: I believe this class is a beast in terms of how much material there is to cover. I believe Dr. Gockel did well for her first time teaching it but there is still much room to improve. I don't believe I gained much knowledge at all from the lecture portion of the class as she wrote her notes word for word form previous instructors that just took the book information. I also found the homework often not helpful as it rarely matched with examples in the book or that we did in class and left me wondering how to solve the problems. The number one improvement I believe dr. Gockel could make is having a better understanding of the book and subject so that when questions are asked she is able to answer them quickly. I believe that skill comes with time and I don't fault her for not knowing some of the information. I believe she did a very good job this semester but has a lot to learn and improve upon. :: Cool class as a follow up to mech. I. Now we got to design real world components."
873,Joy Gockel,2016 Fall,ME 4150,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- you where fine, i just want these notifications to end. :: The instructor has stated many times that her goal in the course is to not teach the material but make sure that you understand how to find the material in the book on your own, so that you as a professional engineer could just reference the notes when you need them. That is okay I guess, but it is extremely frustrating taking an exam that is basically designed to see if you know how to flip through a book. :: No. As already stated, the instructor did not give detailed responses as to why things worked the way they did. Its one thing to show the formulas and solutions from the solution manual but its another to explain to the student why and how the formulas work. Also it is nice to have a picture or video of how things are working, ESPECIALLY in a mechanical engineering course where most things are seen and understood in the physical realm.  I did enjoy how the instructor brought in a sample of a component to a jeep that pertained to the chapter being covered. This is extremely helpful in learning the material!. :: yes, by being able to teach us. :: She gave very good in class examples and was always available during office hours if extra questions rose up. :: yes. gave good examples of differnet situations based on the chapters we were covering. :: Yes, very clear in explanations and lecture materials which made the subject matter clear. :: Yes, particularly with examples and extra office hours.  I really appreciated the office hours and her willingness to help explain a concept three times until I understood it. :: Yes. There was a ton of material to get through so she taught everything fast but well. :: Yes. for more complex mechanisms, she would often offer accompanying visual aids such as bringing in physical specimens or watching videos demonstrating processes. :: She did aid in my understanding of the subject, but not as well as I would have hoped. Often times when a question was asked, she did not have a very good answer, and just said she would get back to us about it. Hopefully she improves in teaching the class next time since this was her first time teaching it. :: yeah she knew it but not much more other then the book. Whenever we ask what would be done in the real world she didn't know much. :: Yes, she went through a lot of different examples. :: Didn't really need her help with this course. :: vadbsh. :: Yes, she was often available to meet and help clarify things before exams. :: Dr. Gockel is great. Helpful and pragmatic."

This class could cover more material in the same amount of time with the same comprehension, but it is not a bad class. :: She is a new professor, and is fairly inexperienced in this material. Over time I believe that her work will improve, its just right now its not great. Plus mechanical engineering needs more women, and seeing a woman teach a class is a great step in the right direction. :: The instructor seems to care a lot about the class. I think she is a great professor but just needs to know where the students are coming from and what they're perspective looks like. :: The class was well put together but there was to much material to cover in such a short amount of time. It seemed like the instructor had to rush to get through it all but she still did a good job to help us understand what was going on. :: I feel like more effort could be put into preparation for each class. :: Exams were overly long. It was difficult to show that I understood the subject because I always felt rushed. :: I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. :: Byah!!"
875,Joy Gockel,2016 Fall,ME 4150,Question 14,"Additional comments--- you where fine, i just want these notifications to end. :: Great at communication! Love the format of the class. Always has an example problem in lecture! Doing example problems is 80% of what makes a great teacher. Some of the theory sections is just exactly out of the book.. Which I understand you have to do. But maybe add a little bit more explanation to it rather than just copying down the book. Other than that great job!. :: Seemed to be to much material sometimes and we had to rush through some of it. :: Exams are VERY packed for the time frame. Understood that a lot of material is needed to be tested in the time span but consider: shortening the material being tested in a single exam and have more of them to cover the same amount of material (for example: exam one can be two chapters instead of three and then have four midterms instead of three), or generally shorten the exam in number of parts. As of right now, students find it difficult to attempt every part of the exam, let alone have time to double check their answers and look for mistakes (for example: solving a whole problem while forgetting to convert a unit, thus carrying it through all the parts, and distorting all their final answers. :: Dr. Gockel is a really good professor, and I would honestly tell everyone who can to take her classes.  She is one of the best professors I have had class with in the Mechanical Engineering department. :: I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. :: A lot of the students are very hard on her which is completely uncalled for. She does to the best of her abilities considering this is a tough class with a lot of different aspects. :: I am registered with the Office of Disability Services. They changed their policy about test proctoring recently and the instructor was very understanding about it by allowing me to schedule test proctoring earlier. :: I believe for Dr. G first time teaching this class it was very well put together. I believe that the quizzes were a little useless as they never helped me understand material better and were really based on how well you remembered a single saying from lecture or where to find info in book. I believe this class would also benefit from being three days a week as the class often felt like it dragged and that there was to much information to comprehend and keep up with the speed of the class. myself and others often felt as though we zoned out by the second half of the class. :: ___     ^   ^   ------------                    |"

Go through more examples and the process for solving problems. :: I definitely like learning the material then using it to solve example problems from the handouts. :: teacher was clear and respectful in class and homeowrk helped with tests and learning. :: Very respectful and great teacher, requires in class attention quiz which is very helpful into clarifying the material just reviewed and further explained from him. :: He was a great teacher, and was able to convey information in a formal way. he is not good when it comes to answering your questions. he either doesnt answer the question you ask or blows off your question completely. :: Hard to understand, great personable guy. :: Just like every other teacher I've seen in the engineering department, he doesn't answer questions. When someone asks for clarification, he just repeats the same drivel that needed the clarification until the student gives up. In that same vein, he doesn't really teach how to solve the problems he inevitably gives us. He talks about unnecessary side information and says a lot without actually saying anything of importance. :: He did very well in the class setting and was always able to answer questions we may have had. :: great teacher. learned a lot from the class and liked the way he structured everything. :: He was plenty respectful, tried to answer questions to the best of his ability. The examples sometimes seemed long and messy, however I never fully engaged to his examples, If one were to follow the whole time i assume it would be understood. :: I feel as though the lecture slides were far too complex for what was trying to be taught.  They went pretty deep into mathematics, but didn't provide enough examples of real-world applications in order to understand the mathematics.  The 'group work' was pretty pointless.  I did enjoy going over certain problems in-class, that is where I learned the most.  If Nikolai would do more in-class examples and more thoroughly walked students through those problems, I think the class would have a much better understanding of what was being taught. :: Nikolai was a decent professor.  I believe he could do so much better teaching and really explain the material.  At times, it was somewhat confusing during the lecture.  But he provided many examples that helped prepare for exams. :: The instructor was really good and affective. :: Professor was efficient in teaching, had good in-class examples and answered questions. Some of the answers were somewhat off topic but effort was made to answer the question. Professor was respectful. :: Professor Priezjev is quite possible the best instructor I have ever taken a class from. His lectures are concise and engaging. He thoroughly explains the material and provides relate-able metaphors as well as thorough examples of the application of the concepts. :: Very clear on everything. I REALLY liked that he gave us homework print outs. Most things these days are online but having a routine weekly packet was very refreshing. :: Some of the instructor's teaching was difficult to understand as there seemed to be a barrier between his understanding of the material and an explanation that could be easily understood. He is clearly very knowledgeable but had trouble communicating his knowledge to us at points. :: The instruction was generally fairly clear, though I felt that occasionally the examples didn't prepare me for the homework very well. Moreover, occasionally the handling of questions led to some slight confusion as opposed to further clarity. :: I thought Dr. Priezjev had a unique way of explaining tough topics and problems as far as trying his best to make the topics fun and relatable. Although there were times where it was hard to understand what he was trying to do when solving the problem that made it sometimes difficult to understand the topic. :: He taught well I thought, but as far as making sure everybody understood the material, he didn't do a good job of that. He handled questions well and respected everyone's  questions/opinions. :: The professor did a great job of handling the classroom, instructing the students, answering questions, and explaining the material. :: he gives us many examples and thats good. :: The instructor was exceptional. :: Good examples, good teaching, fair exams. :: He was very efficient"

Spent too much time on theory, not enough on application/real-world examples. :: Somewhat, but not something i will remember in the future as of materials goes. :: yes. :: Yes. The professor gave examples and 'quizzes' which helped understanding and explained answers and concepts. :: Yes. :: Yes. My primary understanding of the topics came from the professor (instead of TAs, books etc.). :: While the lectures served as a decent introduction to the topic, I never felt like I really understood the material enough to perform in the homework. More discussion on the basic ideas and how to apply them would have helped. :: Yes, he gave a bunch of his on methods to make the problems simpler, which gave a different view to the problem giving myself a better understanding of topics which made the subject easier. :: He aided slightly, there were some situations where he clarified a lot of stuff like on moments and figuring out forces of trusses. :: Yes, the professor did a great job of demonstrating and explaining moments to the students and how to find them based on the given data. :: yes but there is a problem, sometimes i have a problem with his accent. overall he's good. :: Any question I had, he went above and beyond to help me understand it. :: Yes. :: Yes, the in class examples"

I am so happy to have gotten into his Dynamics class for spring semester. Even if your answer is not completely correct, he gives you all sorts of credit for the work you show confirming your knowledge on the problem that wasn't 100% correct. Any partial credit in a math based career is somewhat rare so I really appreciated his efforts to help us receive what we deserve for each problem. :: I feel more work done on both advanced and basic examples would improve general understanding, since I often felt I didn't quite understand the basic concepts. :: He was available a lot for consulting and very compliant with working with the students as far as with trouble understanding the material as well as working with their schedule if there was a conflict during class time. Which was very beneficial and help me throughout the course while I was playing a sport and working. :: Not a bad prof, needs to make sure students understand the material before moving on. :: No further information comes to mind. Professor was just very good in handling the classroom and keeping us on track with the syllabus. :: He is a great teacher and I look forward to having another class with him. :: He did a lot of example questions that were useful"

914,Nikolai Priezjev,2016 Fall,ME 4010,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- He discussed the content of his powerpoint presentations a lot, but had difficulty with explaining how to perform things when need be. :: Clear and repetitive, went over examples in great detail, answered all questions to the best of the ability, and helped very much on explaining the homework assignments. :: The professor barely went over examples or example codes. Not very helpful. :: Did not allow class to be very interactive, especially for a programming type of class. Powerpoint lectures did'nt give amount of detail needed to solve problems and projects. :: The class is supposed to teach us how to apply numerical methods, not learn Fortran.  Unfortunately, all we are shown in class is Fortran, but then the exams are all handwritten applications of the numerical methods.  It would be better if we actually solved problems in class. :: Not much was taught. Instructor just went over powerpoint slides. We would often spend 15 minutes of one class going over what we did in the last class. :: conceptual explanation was strong and useful. :: The teacher was great at teaching us all the material that we've learned in other classes, but utterly failed when it came to helping us to understand how to implement these methods into Fortran. Whenever a specific question was raised, he would deflect away from answering it and tell us to figure it out ourselves. The TA actually came in and lectured FOR him a couple times, and he was much more helpful, and helped to clarify fortran for us a little. Our teacher also canceled many classes on Fridays because he decided that there was not much to teach that day. I can't tell if he just really didnt want tot each this course or is just a lazy instructor, but I'm convinced its one of those options. :: The instructor could not always answer the questions being asked about the topic being presented. :: I believe this subject is very important and numerical methods is an extremely useful tool to have in the engineers toolbox, but after leaving this class I have learned absolutely no numerical methods. I have almost a 100% thus far, but can say I learned nothing: nothing on Fortran, nothing on computational methods, and nothing about engineering. If this class were to be reviewed by the ABET accreditation committees I think the college might actually lose its accreditation.  Any student who says this was a useful class, is only saying that because they got an easy, and I mean extremely easy, A; and I honestly believe if the department was to give a basic exam on the concepts or fundamental learned in this class less than 20% would pass.  The entire class all we did was change inputs in code, and plot things. This could have been an online course, because all the professor did was read from the powerpoints and give us the code to modify. A complete waste of my time and money on this course!  A fortran class should be a pre-req as well, because if you actually want us to learn the numerical methods we should understand the language we are coding it in. :: The instructor treated students well and handled questions well. :: Fortran is really confusing, and the course materials are confusing.  It might be better to use other coding programs which are easier to use and to understand, and more up to date."
915,Nikolai Priezjev,2016 Fall,ME 4010,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes. :: Not really. He needed to go through the code in WAY more detail. :: With doing the material by hand yes, the material to be done by Fortran code (majority of the class) no.  There was no guidance on how to create/modify the code necessary to complete coursework. :: His lecture notes were very helpful. The majority of the subject was self-taught using the lecture notes. :: Yes,brought some applicable example related to the analytical method. :: He refused to aid in my understanding of this subject. Whenever he was asked to go over something by doing an example to show us work, he refused and told us to study at home. He didnt provide us with solutions to any homeworks or study guides. Also, he never lectured on how to actually code Fortran, even though that was the only software we were permitted to use for our projects. :: No, many times told us to Google something to figure it out; when it should have been something that was taught in the class. :: Not at all, and anyone who says this is true is only saying that because they received an EASY A. I have a very high GPA, well within the top 10% of the graduating class and I know I did not learn anything about numerical methods from the coursework provided or the instruction given. Any student who walks out of this class thinking they learned numerical methods is either completely oblivious to education or is just being nice on this review. :: The instructor did aid in my understanding of this subject. He has helped me a few times with my assignments. :: Yes."
916,Nikolai Priezjev,2016 Fall,ME 4010,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- none. :: Class was cancelled about 1/3 of the time. I feel like I should submit a bill to the University demanding 1/3 of my tuition back. :: This class is less of a computational methods class, and more of a Fortran coding class without any instruction in Fortran. It would be much more helpful if we were permitted to use a computational software we are accustomed to, like MATLAB, or teach us a language that will be used in this age, such as Python or something that isnt outdated. :: In the future there needs to be a Fortran class before having to take this one. Most of the class was to busy trying to figure out how to write a code and what it meant to be able to focus on what this class was suppose to be about. :: Useless, uneducating, waste of my time and money, and above all the MME department should be guilty/apologetic graduating students whom have taken this course and are expected to know numerical methods as engineers. :: I was required to use the Fortran computer program to complete assignments. I had no prior experience in using it before taking this course, making it difficult to complete assignments"

Any questions were addressed well. However, I think the understanding of the class would be better tested by the instructor asking the class questions about the material rather than just asking if there are any questions after covering a section. This would prove to us what we do or don't understand in real time. Additionally, I would have preferred that more time was spent on examples of using the material. Although I do realize the importance of working through the derivations and understanding where the equations come from, the material becomes more interesting and easier to remember if I have the experience of using it in some fashion. :: The Instructor did well making complex methods easier to digest, one suggestion is maybe explaining why certain equations are being derived rather than spending an hour deriving the equations and then explaining the significance of it. :: very well organized examples. :: A recap of the earlier class when the the topic is continued in the next class will be greatly helpful. :: Dr. Yang was a fantastic professor! He has a very clear teaching style. Things that I liked about his teaching: * Making notes available online - The notes posted online were very helpful as I was able to bring them to class and make additions to during class. * Drawing diagrams for each section - The diagrams that Dr. Yang drew to help represent the content of each section were very helpful. They made it much easier to visualize the flow and understand the subject.  * Great in class examples - I really appreciate the in class examples that were covered. They were very helpful in understanding the content. * Bonus Quizzes- bonus quizzes were not only great motivation to come to class but were also great to help check our understanding of knowledge. I was able to gauge my understanding of content based on how well I was able to complete the quizzes.  * Projects - I really enjoyed the projects. I was able to dive deeper into the content and I found it very interesting. I felt that I was able to learn a lot of information through the projects.  Overall the course was fantastic! Guidelines and expectations were very clear and the content was interesting. :: He knows what he says , has a good knowledge in the subject and is supportive, treats everyone in the same way with no preferences. :: yes he has good clarity in what he was explaining and course was well organised. :: Effective. :: Professor explained every aspect as we can understand them with ease Gave good examples for the topics. :: Very good. :: Highly encouraging. :: good. :: The professors teaching style is quite good in my opinion.

I enjoyed his class and he was very personable in his approach to teaching. :: The labs were not clear with detailed steps for some labs. Lots of information was left out making us ask alot of questions. :: examples in class were helpful. it would have been nice if homework was posted on pilot. :: He was very nice. I could tell he cared about his students and wanted to teach us knowledge to help us in the real world. The class itself is really a boring subject and difficult to teach. :: I'm really going to miss this class, because I really enjoyed how well you taught the class. This course was challenging, but you made it enjoyable by the examples and applications of where this stuff is used in the real world. I also liked the pace of this , because other classes try and jam so much material into the course and give so much work that it becomes stressful and you don't really get anything out of it. I know engineering is hard and stressful but this class was taught at just the right speed for me. If you had a class where you just talked about engineering in the real world and the experiences you had I would diffidently take it. The talk you had about the amount of air per cubic foot in the earths atmosphere verses in the amount in space really caused me to think. I understood what you were talking about, but it just made me think outside of class and the more I thought about it the more stuff started to make sense. Hopefully all this made sense. :: I felt we moved through the demonstration of LabVIEW too quickly. We kinda blew threw it quickly a couple of times and then were expected to know where everything was for the rest of the experiments. Was willing to help to sort out problems during the experiments, program problems, etc. :: The labs were easy to follow as long as the equipment was working. It was a bit difficult to understand what was required on the lab report though."
957,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject?

Great professor, I learned a lot and I was taught well. Lectures were informative, the handout's were well prepared, coherent, and informative. :: This instructor was very clear during his examples and made following his notes extremely easy for such difficult coursework, the professor was also very respectful I would definitely recommend him. :: I could have benefited from more example problems instead of all the derivations of the equations. :: Very good at explaining the concepts. clear and had good visuals for examples. :: very clear and gives good examples. :: I think the course set-up was great.  He was very organized with his lectures and lecture notes.  Material was covered in a timely and very informative manner. :: He was good at explaining things, and he gave a lot of examples. :: Focuses on theory over examples. :: Great professor, hard material to learn. I think he does a good job of teaching it to the class. :: Dr. Sucosky is obviously proficient in his field, and does not waste class time. However I believe most students would benefit from more practical example problems rather than the highly conceptual problems typically used. :: The instructor does very well with teaching. However, there have been plenty of times in class where I felt I was trying to keep up with him in just taking notes. This wouldn't let me hear some of the explanations behind derivations or equations. :: Very clear and straightforward. Makes learning this class much easier. :: His explanations and examples were very clear and helpful. He also pushed us to do well in the course, but none of his expectations, assignments, or exams were unreasonable. :: He didn't waste any class time. The notes were very helpful and he had each class planned out property. Very professional. :: First off, this class is the most difficult course that I have taken in college. That considered, Professor Sucosky did a great job of explaining the material in such a way that it gave me a fair chance of learning this difficult subject. All questions that students had were handled with great respect, which I am sure that everyone appreciated. :: I think that he does very well with answering questions. :: Explanations were very well done. The subject was very challenging but when I finally understood how he structured the material, it became more clear. He was very good about taking, and answering, questions outside of the class. :: The handout system that he used for this course was very effective. :: Good. Clear expectations. Hard class. :: The handouts were very helpful in going in more depth on some concepts. Make referencing concepts much easier as well as working through problems. Office hours were helpful. Helped me understand more than one homework assignment. Very challenging class, wish there were some more example problems during the lecture, nothing too difficult, just a brief explanation of how it all works. Very challenging class, but doable if effort is put in outside of class. Review sessions for exams very helpful. Keep those up. :: Great instructor. Did everything you would want from a great professor. :: Two things that you can do to make the material a bit easier is to explain the fluid dynamic terms clearly before using that term for the rest of the class.  In other words put the meaning of the term into layman's terms.  Secondly, you need to work more examples rather than going through the derivations that where over my head most of the time.  Lastly, make the homework easier so that one can implement the simple equations in class, ultimately ingraining the basics.   Overall, you are more that fair to the students, and I will definitely recommend your course. :: Excellent teaching style. Really learned a lot. :: The first test was very difficult to prepare for. It wasn't until after the first test that I was able to properly prepare myself to take an exam in my opinion. I was unclear on how to prepare for the tests until after I had received a poor grade on the first one and had to make those corrections. Normally I would assume that it was just me misunderstanding the instructor, but I spoke with multiple people who felt the same way. Maybe doing more review problems and showing students how to utilize with handouts will eliminate some of the poor grades on the first exam. It would also be nice if there were more review material distributed since the homework is made exceptionally more difficult than the exams. Other than that, very informative lectures, I really liked the handouts, tests were fair (once I knew how to prepare for them). :: he is not good at explain , I don't learn any thing. :: The class periods were very organized and easy to follow. I enjoyed listening and taking notes in class. :: Instructor's teaching was straightforward. Definitely stimulated thinking. :: Dr. Sucosky was very clear in his explanations of subject material and would clarify any questions students had on the material. He would stimulate our thinking by use of handouts. Very respectful of the individual. :: Very brilliant man, unfortunately his teaching style tailors only towards the conceptual thinkers. In my opinion he shouldn't have spend all class writing notes for us to copy word for word. That was a big waste of time considering time was an issue in his class. Instead, he should have had the notes already written and he should have merely gone over them in class. If he wanted us to have those specific notes then he could have sent us them through email. The time in class should have been spent doing real world examples and explaining why we use each technique for those examples. The exams were very fair and I greatly appreciated the review session. I greatly disagree that one bad exam grade can lower your average by an obscene amount, but that is not really his fault as much as it is the university's. :: overall, the course went well. Philippe Sucosky gave very detailed lectures, notes and handouts. the homeworks were really difficult.  however, the lectures were kinda dry. they were sometimes too mathematical. students were struggling with the materials due to lack of specific examples. i think"
971,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 3350,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- yes his handouts were helpful to solve problems. :: absolutely, the professor derived the fundamental equations for fluid dynamics and gave real world applications for each where applicable. :: Yes they tried to explain all the concepts and really challenged us on the homework. :: yes. held office hours 4 times a week, this helped me to understand the homework and the concepts that were being used. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor aided in my understand of the subject. :: When I needed help with the homework assignments, I went to his office hours and he explained things to me. :: Yes. :: Yes. The handouts and homework solutions were the most helpful portion of the class. :: Yes. Very difficult topic but did excellent in teaching it. :: Yes, Provided examples and was always available for help when needed. Tests were straightforward if you studied what he had told you to. Overall very clear. :: Yes. His notes were very helpful, he was available for consultation, and he connected the class to real world examples and applications. :: He showed videos and real world example in the lecture. :: The many handouts that Professor Sucosky made available to the class were a great help due to the information and example problems that they contained. As the course went on, I appreciated them more and more and relied on them greatly to gain an understanding of the material. :: Yes. Mostly because I knew nothing about this subject, but know I can come out of the class definitely having retained information. :: Yes very much so. He was willing to meet me outside of class and regularly scheduled office hours to explain things that I was struggling with. He was also willing to explain things in different ways to aid in my understanding. :: I often went to his office hours for help with the homework and he really helped me understand what was going on and got me on the right track with the problems. :: Yes. :: Yes. Broke down difficult ideas into more manageable parts. :: Refer to last post. :: No, it's like calculus not more than that. :: He did aid in my understanding of fluids. As an example, when we talked about streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines, he showed real examples of how they can be used. I really enjoyed watching the video or the race car with the smoke lines running over it. I went home and looked up a bunch more videos like it. :: Dr. Sucosky implemented the use of handouts that made complex theories and examples easier to understand and to follow along with. :: I am not much of a conceptual thinker and I cannot pay attention to a man speaking for 55 straight minutes, so I did not learn much from this class unfortunately. That does not mean he didn't explain it well to someone who is a conceptual thinker, I am just not one."
972,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 3350,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Wonderful instructor, challenging homework, challenging course, but without this instructor challenging me to due my best I would not have succeeded. :: He was always on time and class time was well spent. :: N/a. :: No further comments. :: I would have liked to see more examples in class instead on only derivations. :: Professor Sucosky is definitely one of the better instructors that I have had while at Wright State and would definitely be interested in taking more courses with him if they were available. :: Coming into this course, all I heard about was how hard this class is. He is a great professor and he says straight away that this is tough material. You just have to put effort in and then you'll be okay. :: He is a very respectable instructor with an immense amount of experience. I enjoyed his course overall. I would have liked to hear more about his experience in the field during class. I felt motivated to understand the material when he would speak of real world applications. :: Good professor. :: No. :: I hope he makes the hw very reasonable it was challenge in class. :: I had heard that this was the most difficult class in mechanical engineering. I would say that I agree with that so far. However, I really did enjoy the class. My grades hurt me a bit, but I enjoyed the class as a whole. :: The use of handouts and videos to help convey major components of fluid dynamics was very helpful. Videos were also helpful as a visual reference for examples."
973,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 3350,Question 14,"Additional comments--- I thought the textbook was a waste of money.  I barely used it.  The homework was very difficult and graded rather harshly. :: homework was hell. :: Most difficult class I have had yet! Homework load was heavy but helpful. All and all great instructor!. :: I think it would be beneficial to have either more examples worked in class or possibly have an optional recitation type class set up to go over additional problems. If it were in class it would take away more time, so that's why I suggest having that other class period to give more understanding to the problems. I felt like I was understanding the material better during the review sessions for the tests, and that the review sessions aided a lot in my understanding of the course. :: No further comments. :: I would enjoy taking another course of his.. Hopefully not Fluid Dynamics again!. :: No. :: I feel sorry, this class so hard because of the teacher way, he must take in consideration there are a level of student not same way of thinking, beside that this course become as the hardest class in mechanical . :: He's a good instructor, and I liked that he was theory oriented. I had a difficult time with learning how to apply what he was teaching if I was being told that the book nor the homework would help with tests.  What I mean by that is that normally, I could read a text book, and as long as I could follow along and work through the example problems and understand what I was doing then I would well on the exams.  But for this class I'm being told that the book won't help me.  And normally I could work through homework problems and as long as I understood what I was doing then I'd do okay on exams, but for this class I'm being told that the homework is harder than exam problems so studying from them wouldn't be helpful either. So all I have are the notes, and practice exams that he gives us, but aside from the practice exam what other way am I supposed to practice applying the theory? Obviously the exam problems won't be exactly like the practice problems, so what other way do I have to prepare myself for varying types of questions that he could give? I think that's the part that frustrated me the most. :: I personally would not take him again; I prefer a teacher who is straightforward in his teaching, lots of examples, and only writes down the most important information for notes. :: you could provide notes to students, it would be nice. most of the time in class was taking notes. so i think providing notes will cut off time in class. you could use the extra time to give more specific examples like the review section."

The questions about the course is well explained. I do learn how to think about a specific topic. :: The course materials are very understandable, and the explanations are wall defined. :: The instructor did an exceptional job in making a very complicated topic very clear to understand. The lectures always stimulated ideas for research in me.  The course design is also beautiful. Instead of mundane homeworks, we had a project that significantly helped me even beyond the course. This is the best course I have had in Wright State. The professor's teaching method was immaculate, in my opinion and if I ever be a teacher, I will do many things similarly. :: He was very clear in what he wanted and expected. His explanations were more than helpful, and made complicated matters less so."
985,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 7980,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Through this class, I am becoming clear how to deal with a project, how to make the project professional. :: Yes, he did. The professor helped my a lot on understanding the concepts in the Bio-fluid field. :: Yes, all the time. :: Yes, very much so. We had a CFD project due, so he set up a workshop in class to help students who were less familiar with the program."
986,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 7980,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- It is very worthwhile to learn this course. :: Difficult topic, great admiration for the professor, enlightening experience."
987,Philippe Sucosky,2016 Fall,ME 7980,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Dr. sucosky is quite professional to have the students understand what the course is going on, how to do academic researches. I think I have a lot improvement by his class. I like his class. :: Everyone who is doing research work in the field in Wright State, should take this course."
988,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Mian does a pretty good job overall. Needs to review his notes to better lay out what points are crucial. :: Excellent. :: Pretty low. You can tell he is a a knowledgeable person but he just cant seem to convey it in a meaningful way, and often gets lost in the details. Most lectures feel like they are winged and have little practical knowledge for the purpose of an undergraduate course. :: Dr. Mian was effective. :: A bit hard to understand at times but overall is complete and does give all of the information. :: He's a nice guy, but his ability to convey a subject in class leaves a little to be desired. He's very knowledgeable though. :: Considering that this is a new course and Dr. Mian has only taught it once before this semester, he struggled in deciding which topics he wanted to focus on. It seemed as if he was 'winging' it the whole semester. With that said, I would rate it overall performance a 6/10. :: Good. :: best instructor i have seen ever. :: great. :: Great. :: Dr. Mian was a very good instructor for this course and was helpful. :: He is a great professor and we learned a lot in 3D-printing, which the future of the industry. He's knowledgeable on the subject. :: He is very supportive with student. And he always available for answering emails. :: HE IS DOING VERY WELL HE TRIED ALL THE BEST. :: Very effective. :: Okay. Could of been organized a little better. Return rate of grades was bad. Homework was straight forward and reflected what he put on the exams. :: Dr. Mian has good intentions. I think class time was used reasonably well. For an Additive Manufacturing class, I would have thought we would spend more time in the lab talking about the machines and settings used on those. :: very good. :: Taught material well, but scheduling assignments and dates not good. Not enough time to prepare last 2 weeks which for graduate students is 50% of your grade. :: Very effective by describing the material behind the course as well as showing numerous examples. The instructor was very good teaching and helping the students. :: Very knowledgeable.  Lectures were clear and understandable. :: Good. :: not bad. :: yes. :: Good. :: good"
989,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- It seems no. I am not sure he, his grader, and the students were ever on the same page as to what was expected as far as answers. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Expectations seems to be not well defined. :: yes. :: Basically kept to the syllabus. :: Not quite. Him and his T.A. has different grading criteria's when it came to homeworks. Dr. Mian instructed us to do homeworks a particular way, but the grader wanted a different, more in-depth, approach during which he took off many points off homeworks. When the class informed Dr. Mian about the situation, he did nothing to change the outcomes and did not take initiative to correct the situation. Rather, he told us to go to the T.A. individually and talk to him, which from personal experience, was no help. On his exams, the questions were very open ended. For the project presentations, he gave me outlines for which to follow and he was very harsh on some groups because they didn't talk about things that Dr. Mian wanted them to talk about, even though Dr. Mian gave us no guidance or restrictions. :: Good. :: yes. :: Awesome. :: Yes, he worked very closely to the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: YES, SURE. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he graded and evaluated my work based on the solutions he gave out in class in order to help us reach our goal of understanding. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: I feel that the syllabus did not reflect what was required for the homework or course material as well as it could. :: yesyes"
990,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes to both. :: Yes. :: No. Late some but not much and sometimes let out early. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yep. :: Yes. :: Good. :: yes. :: Yes, the class always started on time and he used the entire class everyday. :: Always he was few minutes late for a few times. :: VERY WELL. :: Yes. :: Of course. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Can be side tracked and talked about things not related to material. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes"
991,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes, he seems to thoroughly enjoy the subject which helps as a student. :: Very good. :: Not really. He would not post notes online because he wanted more people to come to class. But then would not give a good lecture. :: Dr. Mian used many examples from current research in addition to videos. :: by taking us to labs to see the equipment. :: Decently. :: 4/10. :: Good. :: funny and nice slides. :: He always made sure everyone understood the current subject before he moved on which was always helpful. :: He actually did the best in trying to deliver the idea of addtive manufacturing. :: HIS WAY TO DELIVER THE TOPIC VERY ORGANIZED. :: Would provide more explanation if examples were unclear. :: Yes. :: Answering questions in class to the best of his ability. If he didn't have an answer he would look it up outside of class and come back the next day with an answer. :: very good. :: Talked about manufacturing industries and applications that is relatable. :: Asked if we ever needed help or to ask questions at any time. :: We discussed future education plans during office hours. :: Showing some related videos. :: not bad. :: pretty well. :: very interested. :: yes"
992,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communicates well, typically answers questions the best he can and responds pretty quickly to emails. :: Very good. :: Average, which is not great. :: Generally, Dr. Mian communicated well. However, criteria for homework and exams seemed a bit undefined. :: reasonably well. :: He would email the class, but with the new outlook changes it was difficult. Some emails people wouldn't get. Fix outlook. :: 6/10. :: Good. :: he is awesome. :: The instructor communicated well both in and out of the classroom through both Pilot and email. :: He was always available through email and office hours and sometimes he is available in his office without his office hours time. :: VERY QUICK AND UNDERSTAND. :: Very effective through email and in person. :: Answered emails most of the time. Office hours were offered. :: Frequently by email . And open door policy. :: excellent. :: No well. Always posted material late and big assignments not enough time. :: very effectively. :: Inside the classroom: great. Outside the classroom: announcements could have been made earlier. :: Very good. :: GOOD. :: mostly everytime. :: pretty good. :: yes good"
993,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No, notes often didn't match what was posted on pilot and he seemed to bounce around a lot. Never was sure what points were critical or not.. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: A little disorganized. :: He would sometimes go on tangents. But they'd be relief tangents. :: No, but that could be because it is a new course that has only been taught once before this semester. :: Good. :: yes. :: The course content and lectures were a little unorganized at times but overall he did a good job at staying organized. :: Yes. :: YES, VERY WELL. :: Yes. :: Final 50% of our grade in the class was scheduled for the final week of the class. Class content was organized. The delivery of the content throughout the long term of the class was poor. :: Yes, for the most part. Some of the material was a little dated. I'd maybe suggest pulling current research articles as course notes. :: yes. :: For the most part. :: yes well organized. :: Yes. :: Good. :: YEAH. :: yes. :: it was ok. :: yes"
994,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Likes helping people  but explains things really vaguely. :: Yes. :: yes he was reasonably available on line. :: Yep. :: Yes. :: Good. :: yes. :: The instructor was always available through office hours, emails, and would set up appointments if you needed to meet outside of his hours. :: Yes always. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Took consideration of what works best for class. :: yes every time. :: Yes.  Very responsive. :: Always. :: YEAH. :: yes. :: yes, very. :: yes"
995,Akm Mian,2017 Summer,ME 4180,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Needs to have grading rubrics for students and his grader to follow. Needs to return homework assignments with feedback.  It makes it near impossible to prepare for an exam without these things. :: No. :: asdf. :: I would have appreciated a more practical approach to the course instead of going so far into the theory. :: none. :: Dudes nice. :: No. :: no. :: f. :: No. :: No. :: I JUST WANT TO THANK Dr. Mian  he is the best one in University his style of dealing it is of good and respect. :: No. :: Maybe to give grad students more time with the assignments. Think about it, we had 50% of our grade spread out over the 11 week term which included 2 exams and homework. The project that was assigned wasn't given a good description of what was to be expected. In addition, the literature review paper is a lot of work for 10% of the course grade and a limited amount of time to do it. These reviews are for thesis students that take 30 weeks to complete it, not 5. Plus there is a take home final, which with past experience I know will take more time than an in class final. So the last 50% of the course grade is determined in a matter of 3 days. Some people work well under pressure, others don't. Try to spread out the grades and assignments so students that want to put their best foot forward on the paper have the opportunity to do so. :: no. :: Great class very helpful. :: No. :: No. :: nope"
996,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very good professor, has a practical lecture which is very engaging. :: very detailed in teaching and understanding. :: Good professor and great with lecture style of explaining content and then providing examples to follow. :: Really excited about teaching. Very passionate about the subject. :: Very helpful. :: Professor Camberos is an excellent instructor for fluid dynamics, and any subject related to thermo-fluids. :: ok. :: meh. :: Neutral. :: good. :: Effective- took extra time to discuss in depth issues as they presented themselves.  Responsive, logical and consistent in stating expectations from students. :: he's very helpful and try's to do everything for the student. :: Taught at a high level. :: Jose was an incredible instructor. Along with fluid dynamics, I gained a deeper knowledge in thermodynamics, calculus and differential equations. He displayed his breadth of knowledge by describing the material clearly and relating it to previous knowledge. He made the class enjoyable and interactive. I was looking forward to going to his lectures. Above all else, he was fair, kind and understood the expectations of an undergraduate class. :: The instructor was very effective in his teaching method and style overall. :: Mr. Camberos was an effective teacher at times. Sometimes the book and section material hindered his effectiveness but that can happen. :: Dr. Camberos was a fantastic instructor, even though I am not personally a fan of his teaching style. He is very clearly invested in being a teacher, as someone who very rarely takes a break from instructing. I personally would like more examples as opposed to conceptual, however I do understand he generally teaches graduate level, so it makes sense he would focus a lot on concepts."
997,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Since it was his first semester teaching some things did change throughout the course. As he figured out how to work with the class, he made alterations that were for the better of the students. :: yes. :: Yes he told us everything he wanted from us. :: meh. :: No. :: yes. :: Very good- covered the expected materials in class and was available outside of class for consultation. :: yess!. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: He held extremely closely to the syllabus, its much appreciated."
998,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Every class period was started on time and maintained on topic the entire time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Excellent use of class time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes the instructor did routinely start class on time and then use a little more than the full class period. :: Mr. Camberos promptly started on time and met for the full class period. :: He very much made sure to both start class on time and use the full period during the entirety of the semester.
999,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Very much so. :: with the applications of the math for fluid dynamics. :: By applying the content to real world applications. :: Very much so. He connected with the students more than other professors I have had in the past. :: yes. :: Professor Camberos is hands down awesome, he is in my top 5 favorite professors. What I liked the most about Camberos teaching style is he also discussed the history side of fluid dynamics which I feel is equal important as the material. :: yes. :: Consistently identified class strengths and weakness- it was obvious that he was reviewing the homework/exams with an eye toward progressing student comprehension. :: he give's us many example in class and in hw. :: Yes. :: Yes. He understood undergraduates and wanted us to understand the topics as best we could. He explained fluid dynamics in the most practical and approachable way. :: Yes, the instructor did demonstrate an interest in my learning. :: He encouraged students to ask questions not only about the content, but also about real world scenarios in which this content applied."
1000,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- easy to communicate with. :: very well. :: Very well. :: Very effective. He used email and said we could text him and let him know when we needed an email answered promptly. :: very well. :: Communication with the professor was not an issue at all. :: well. :: Good. :: well. :: Very good- took the time to explain without outright giving answers.  Willing to compare student processes and answers with the correct methods and solutions. :: he's provided every where. :: He communicated very effectively  inside class. I never contacted him outside class. :: The instructor communicated well both in and out of the classroom. :: Mr. Camberos was easy to get a hold of and was very accommodating when asked questions. :: He communicated very well as he provided both email and cell phone contact.
1001,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes, always kept the students updated. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He followed the slides and had preplanned example problems. :: yes. :: The lectures were 100%!. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Well organized- the book had some shortcomings which he specifically worked to overcome in lecture. :: yes. :: Somewhat. :: Yes, some of the best lectures I ever had. :: Yes, the course content and lectures were well organized. :: The course content and lectures were organized but didn't flow well for a multitude of reasons. One reason was that the book had omitted sections which made solving example problems difficult. Another reason was that the lecture power points were not his own work. He had borrowed them from a fellow professor that usually teaches this class and his teaching style didn't flow with the power point at times. :: They were very well structured and he tried his best to hold to the schedule laid out at the beginning of the semester."

1003,Jose Camberos,2017 Summer,ME 3350,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- AWESOME PROFESSOR :). :: No. :: Personally, I really enjoyed this course. Before coming into this subject, I really dreaded it. I would be willing to take another course from Professor Camberos in the future. :: I am extremely thankful that I had Professor Camberos as an instructor for fluid dynamics and I will be taking his class again if I ever get the chance. One of the nicest professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students. :: steps to properly merge with highway traffic step 1 accelerate to highway speed step 2 identify the opening in traffic flow in which you would like to merge into step 3 adjust speed to match traffic flow for the chosen opening step 4 merge into traffic opening. :: I would take another course from him. :: No, I do not have any additional comments. :: Mr. Camberos was a good teacher however getting grades back timely was a issue. At times homework's were given back for weeks at a time which made it difficult to learn what mistakes you made on the homework."
1004,James Menart,2017 Summer,ME 7350,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Mostly effective. :: super. :: Great in making the concept understanding. :: Lectures were helpful in providing required knowledge though it would have been helpful to have more in class examples to demonstrate how to complete the homework. :: I consider Dr. Menart the best professor in the Mechanical Engineering program.  He provides relevant examples, explains concepts in a clear way, and legitimately cares about the success of his students. :: Satisfactory. :: not bad. :: Excellent. :: He always been the most active person i have met in WSU. :: he was very effective in teaching the concepts. :: Very good. :: very good"

1006,James Menart,2017 Summer,ME 7350,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes he even occasionally used longer than the full period. :: very fine. :: Yes, He's perfect in that. :: Yes, towards the end of the semester he even took extra time and days. :: Yes. :: Very efficiently. :: yes. :: yes. :: He has always been on time and have always given his 100 percent. :: yes. :: Excellent in this regard. :: yes"
1007,James Menart,2017 Summer,ME 7350,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He was passionate about the material and helped when we had questions. :: Good. :: Always took extra time after class to discuss questions and concerns. :: He is always willing to help whether it is during office office or any other time. :: Explaining with examples. :: no. :: Excellent :10/10. :: He always try to dig into the details and help us to understand the topic. :: he made the lecture very interesting by making the new developments in the concepts from the old ones that are delt. :: Through interesting lectures. :: by asking questions and encouraging to think on topic
1008,James Menart,2017 Summer,ME 7350,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- effectively. :: Great, he is outstanding in his role. :: Very effectively. :: Good. :: bad. :: Excellent :10/10. :: He has always been helpful and easy to communicate both inside and outside the class. :: yes he was very effective. :: Good. :: very effectively"
1009,James Menart,2017 Summer,ME 7350,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes until the last day, that was messy. :: Yes. To the best standard. :: yes. :: Yes.  Granted this was the first time the course has been taught in probably at least 7 years, there were a few bumps along the way but the is to be expected for any class in this situation.  If any errors were made, Dr. Menart was sure to go back and correct them to ensure students had accurate information.  I think more time on the RHT may be beneficial (for example how we essentially used the Navier-Stokes equation throughout the entire semester of convective heat and mass transfer).  Other than that, coming up with more unique symbols for variables may be a good thing.  It was discussed that there are a large number of variables and sometimes symbols get repeated, even in the textbook.  For example, F is used for blackbody fractions and view factor both,  E was used for emissive power and a different term in the scattering and absorption coefficients for the RHT.  There are multiple other cases.  While you can eventually tell what the symbol means from the equation/context, I think its easier for students who are just learning the material if they have unique values.

Handled questions well, seemed very respectful of students. Continually told class to stop and think for a moment before jumping into problem (good). :: Did not cover examples effectively and did not go over how to work problems. :: I thought that he was a pretty good instructor. I would recommend him to a friend if they asked. He went through content well, showed several examples, but didn't always get through them all. This is understandable as many of the examples are quite long. Gives good materials for exam prep. Answers most questions clearly. Seems like he cares about students' learning. :: Was great at teaching I just rather it be more interactive. :: Pretty much everything was set on what was expected of students. To come to class everyday since additional information was taught everyday on the subjects. If class time ran out then additional examples needed to further understand the material was uploaded to the pilot page. Exams covered material that was covered in class and additional practice exams were available for studying. :: He respected the students but sometimes he explained material poorly. :: was good at keeping the classes attention and involvement thru in class mini-quizzes. :: very straightforward and was open to questions during lecture if they came up. :: Professor Priezjev was very clear and concise in all of his examples and explanations and provided ample opportunities to learn the course material. :: He did very well going over examples in class and explaining how to do each concept through his examples. :: He was sometimes unclear with explanations, but examples where well explained. :: He was very clear with his explanations of the notes and with any questions students had."
1023,Nikolai Priezjev,2018 Fall,ME 2120,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes, he supplied us with charts and diagrams to further our understanding. :: yes he answered any questions asked thoroughly. :: Yes. Overall, Priezjev was a good teacher. Sometimes it felt like he didnât cover enough of the more significant sections, but he did highlight every type of problem that we were tested on. :: Yes but it is not an effective way of teaching. Out of all the lectures covered, I did not learn from the paragraphs upon paragraphs of explanation presented on the slides. :: I mean, I don't really have any specific examples, but he seemed to help me learn. :: Yes. :: Yes, the professor covered examples that would help to further understand the homework problems and possible problems that would be on exams. :: yes, he explained problems. :: Yes, I learned more than i had previously had known. :: even when confused in a variable people could ask for clarification. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was able to answer every question that we had with clarity and even by showing examples that helped us learn the content better. :: Yes, he pushed me to think about what was happening rather than just the math. Especially for friction and reaction problems. :: Nikolai helped with a question that I had when I was not fully understanding the material."
1024,Nikolai Priezjev,2018 Fall,ME 2120,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Good teacher. No further comments. :: His use of english makes listening to lectures a little difficult.  It's not that I cant understand the accent, it's just the sentence structure that confuses me.  For example when he describes fractions, instead of saying three fourths he would say three four. :: I actually agree somewhat on all of the above questions. That wasn't just to get it over with. :: Nothing else to be said. :: He was very fair. :: He was very straightforward and presented his expectations well. :: As we became further into the semester, the material became more difficult, but I was up to the challenge and learned the material well."

Occasionally went through slides too quickly, but posting to pilot after the fact helped. There may be a reason, but why not post slides for students to look over before lecture/reference during lecture?. :: Dr. Priezjev was always willing to go further in detail on concepts and was interested in teaching us the history of polymers. He would include little quizzes in the slides for us to talk with each other to collaborate on an answr. :: Lectures were clear and effective in communicating ideas. Reviewing the previous lectures topics was helpful especially for the more complicated information. :: Nikolai did a very great job teaching the material, provided clear examples, and was very respectful towards the students. :: Dr Priezjev is an amazing professor! You can tell he's very passionate about this subject and wants us to learn. He is never unreasonable in what he has us do and responds promptly to any questions. :: He handled questions well and was able to provide clarification. :: He would offer the best explanations and would always keep the class entertained with the knowledge needed to be taught. :: The professor excelled in all these areas.

He talks a lot about how polymers are like spaghetti. :: Yes, he was able to answer any question. :: Yes, for example in order to explain capillary action within polymers, he showed us how candles work. :: The instructor did an amazing job explaining the material in a way that students could understand easily. Professor spent extra time on harder topics. Did not waste a bunch of time on just one subject. :: Yes my understanding of how temperature and time can affect the micro structures of polymers. :: Yes. He had several learning skills and somewhat form of cartoon to explain some concept."
1038,Nikolai Priezjev,2018 Fall,ME 4720,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Content was normally reviewed for the first 20 minutes of every class, which is unnecessary. A 5-10 minute review of the last lecture would suffice. Also, some of the material had not been covered before the homework due dates, which made it hard to complete the assignments. :: -. :: He's a great professor. :: Nikolai's grasp on polymers is very admiring and it motivated the class all the more to seek more knowledge/skills concerning them. :: Nikolai is a great professor that puts in effort to make sure his students learn. :: The material covered in this course was very focused on the makeup of each polymer discussed in the course info. :: Class was great"

I didn't really like all of the derivations we went through. I felt we could have learned more or covered more material if we had the derivations in front of us before class so that we didn't have to spend so much time writing them out. There were many times where I was trying so hard to keep up with all the writing that it was difficult to track with what she was saying to explain the derivations. If possible, it would help students learn to have the derivations already done and go through the thought processes in class. That would also leave more time for practical examples, something I felt was missing from the material. There was a lot of theory and not as many practical problems. :: Dr. Gockel's teaching style is perfectly awesome. All the necessary clarifications are included along with examples. She answers all of the questions nicely and respects the individuals. :: Professor is teaching perfectly to the point and she is able to answers the questions discussed in the class. :: all the aspects were good and neatly explained. :: Dr. G really broke down the math heavy subjects into understandable tid bits that were easy to understand.

She made herself available for office hours and was very responsive to emails. :: Yes, instructor did aid my understanding for this subject. She well defined all the basic concepts with perfect examples suiting those concepts and her homeworks were well defining the concepts studied in the class. :: Yes professor is good related to course. For example she takes quizzes which is very helpful because from that we need to learn whatever discussed in last couple of lectures. :: yes.

A Powerpoint presentation was used for every lecture. The slides were straight from the book so there was very little additional information from the professor. The professor sometimes switched to the next slide before we were able to write down the needed formulas. This prevented us from getting the necessary learning needed for the rest of our college experience and the class itself. :: The lecture notes were directly out of the book and all examples were done very quickly. The class structure seemed a bit disorganized but overall the professor was very attentive to the questions being asked. The syllabus was not very clear on material provided for exams. :: The class information was rattled off shotgun style and was too much too fast to understand. :: The instructor had ok powerpoints, but he needed to have more examples in his class. I felt the class turned into a boring powerpoint lecture. The instructor did some examples in class, but I feel they just blended in with the powerpoints. I feel his power points need to be revamped. I feel he needs to reevaluate his exams. I heard that he changed his exams from when they were 2 hours exams and just changed the time on them to 1 hour and 20 minutes instead of scaling down the exams appropriately question wise. The first exam I felt was appropriate, but the second exam was way to long. He had to extend the exam period by 15 or 20 minutes just to give people enough time to attempt all the problems. Also he didn't exam grade the second exam, his grader did and graded them unfairly. That right there is a bullshit thing to have done. There is no excuse for a grader to grade exams that is just being lazy, shit professor who showed he isn't there for teaching he is only there for research. Which is the biggest problem with instructors at this school. :: Very good. :: The instructor handled questions well and was very clear in the approaches to solve the problems. :: Explanations and examples were too long and focused on too much of the math rather than the process of solving the problem. Wasted a significant portion of lecture time, in my opinion. Instructor is very respectful and will answer any questions. Tests were outrageously difficult, with a large number of students staying well past the scheduled class end time."
1079,Hamed Attariani,2018 Fall,ME 4140,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject?

Because of his lack of teaching, I was unable to pay attention to the lecture. I learned as much just by reading the book than I did through listening during the lecture. :: Mostly taught out of the book and not very many real world examples. :: The teacher was somewhat helpful.  His use of real world examples was helpful to understand the purpose of each section but the core information was poorly delivered. :: Yes.

The content of each question was very helpful for my overall learning of the class. :: good. :: by different examples. :: asked if we had questions. :: Professor provided many practical examples during his class, took several quizes which were based on understanding and exams were also very much based on understanding. :: He constantly made sure everyone understood the material through asking the class if they had questions or if they understood the current material.  He was always open for questions and kept the class involved. :: By giving good and clear examples regarding the topics. :: really well. :: He tried to make it a friendly class with full of useful discussions that related to the subject.

1111,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes each class was recorded on pilot which allowed students to have the opportunity to return to them anytime they may have been needed as well as the homework was given at a very good and manageable pace. :: yes. :: yes there were organized that all of us can understand. :: Yes. :: Yes, lecture and content were well organized. The notes on pilot were a little goofy and hard for me to read. The hierarchical heading structure did a good job or organizing everything, but my understanding would have benefited from a more open format. At least some arrows to connect related concepts. :: Absolutely. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Dr. Menart had a different course structure but overall the content and lectures were very well organized. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, each was numbered and in order. :: Yes. :: Yes, very well organized. :: Very. :: Yes. :: Yes, he came in everyday with a schedule planned. :: Mostly. :: Yes, he used the computer to take his notes and were very well done. :: Yes. Everything built on top of each other. Taught it well and showed how topics related to each other. :: Yes. All of the content was displayed in the syllabus and lectures are extremely well organized.  He also recorded all of his lectures and put them on pilot for students to re watch and listen. :: Lectures and content were arranged in a way that made sense. :: yes. :: All course content seemed to flow very well and lectures were very efficient and go straight to the point. :: Yes. :: Not all. :: yes. :: Yes it was. :: Extremely. :: He always came ready to class with a plan in mind. :: Yes, very much so.  It was a little awkward in the recitation that was shared with the other section.  The other section was sometimes working with slightly different material, but the TA made it work. :: The course lectures were well organized and the instructor did an amazing job at going above and beyond what was required by recording all lectures, both audio and a video of when he was taking notes, and making them available on Pilot. This was extremely helpful for when I missed a class due to illness and I needed to get caught back up on my work. :: Yes. :: Very well organized. :: very. :: Lectures could be hard to follow at times with bouncing around the notes making it hard to keep up. Otherwise content is well laid out and easily accessible. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: it is well organized. :: Very much so. :: sort of. :: Yes everything blended very well towards the end of the semester. :: yes he was organized"
1112,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes the few times i needed any other instruction the instruct was readily available. :: yes. :: yes he was. :: Yes. :: I did not come to him with my needs using any method of communication. I answered some questions I had directly after class and was very pleasant. :: Every single time. :: Yes. :: no. :: Dr. Menart did not have study sessions for exams and rarely encouraged students to come to his office hours but I was aware of his office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: i don't know. :: yes. :: As far as I know. I didn't need to see him much outside of class because I understood the material. :: yes. :: Yes,. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Never had an appointment or meeting with him. :: Yes. :: I'm not sure, I didn't need to go. :: Yes. :: Yes. Dr Menart. responded two both email questions I had within 24 hrs. :: Yes, on all fronts. :: yes. :: Yes, he was always willing to answer any questions or concerns. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was. Even he would contact you personally if you need anything. :: yes. :: Yes he was.  He is willing to accommodate a change in finals week schedule for me, which I am very grateful for. :: Yes. :: I never went to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Did not attempt to use any of these resources. :: Both of them. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Not sure."
1113,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Not at this time. :: He is the best so far, And Mr. Menart just keep doing what are you doing. :: I would like to thank him. He made me love this course and I'm considering now taking thermodynamics 2 if he is teaching the class. :: The irresponsible part of me liked that attendance was not mandatory and that homework was not collected. That being said, I think I would have done better in the course if I showed up more often and did the homework sets as I was learning the material in class, instead of working though all of them the day before the exam to study. It was a pleasure learning from Dr. Menart. He seems to be a man of good character who takes pride in his work. I will watch for his name and try to take more courses with him if I can. :: Nope. I would recommend any student to Dr. Menart. :: nope. :: Nope. :: No. :: No,. :: no. :: He's a very good professor that cares about the knowledge that his students are receiving, and the information that he is presenting. Most only care about the presentation of the knowledge and not whether or not the material is actually being absorbed. Dr. Menart is a great teacher of this topic. :: Need quizzes or something to even out grades, or make tests easier to achieve. killing my GPA just for the sake of averaging the class at a 70 on every test is pretty uncool. :: Great professor. 10/10 would take again. :: One of my favorite teachers so far in college. Great teacher. :: One of the best instructors I've had thus far. :: Dr. Menart is an extremely good teacher and has made my interest for thermodynamics increase. Coming in to the class I was unsure if I would enjoy the class or not, but he has made me really enjoy the subject and pursue it further. :: Occasionally his notes get really sloppy. :: No. :: I would make homework worth 5 percentage points. I had no incentive to do the homework as the layout currently is. Even if the students will look up answers, at least it gets them to look at the homework. I would also have the pretest not worth any points on your grade. Some of the content was never touched in previous courses taken and I feel like I was punished because of it. The pretest should be used to gauge where students are at, not as easy points in my opinion. Other than those minor complaints, he did a great job teaching the course of thermodynamics. :: Truly a passionate and great teacher. Wished more professors were as interested and engaging in the material they taught as Dr Menart is. :: No further comments. :: My only complaint was assigning homework the week of the exam. Id rather receive the homework earlier so I have more time to study. :: Dr. Menart is one of the best professors I have had at Wright State. :: No. :: no. :: He is a good prefessor. :: Great job teaching this semester, looking forward to taking more of your classes. :: Very good job, and thank you very much!. :: This was one of the best professors that I have had and he showed so much interest in the topic and the students in the classroom that it made you want to learn the topic as well. :: No. :: I really wish we had more assignments. The only graded material we had were the five exams. Quizzes and homework would be very helpful to give us direction on what to study as well as add more grades to balance out the exam scores. :: Great instructor, highly enjoyed the course. :: You're a good man Charlie Brown. :: Stay the same. You are the best!. :: No. :: I learned a lot from the instructor and I'd like to take another class with him. :: no. :: Awesome professor! I learned a lot and would definitely take another class he is teaching in the future."
1114,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- great. :: Very effective in class and by posting all of the content online it was even easier to follow. :: great!. :: Best Professor I've had. :: Awesome. :: Dr. Menart does an excellent job of communicating with his students. His lessons were very thorough and complete throughout the semester. :: He did a good job. :: He is helpful and respectful. :: The instructor did a good job providing notes. :: Good. :: Very effective. :: Very effective. Relates the concepts discussed to their current use around the world which gives awareness to the current industry out there. :: helpful, well versed with the subject, very organised with the notes and how he presents in the class. :: Excellent. :: Good content wise, but tended to mess up the equations and we were sometimes not informed until very close to the exam. :: Best instructor at the university. Dr. Menart communicates the content better than most anyone, and is very patient with learning. :: Quite effective. :: he is patient and friendly. he makes me easier to study the wind power. :: Great. :: very effective. :: Instructor was very effective. He makes the complicated thing in pieces to make it simpler. :: Dr. Menart is an extremely effective instructor. It can be easily observed that his passion is the wind industry. I believe it is because of this that he explains the subject so well. :: very helpful and clear about the course content. :: Dr. Menart is a very effective teacher. He clearly understands the topic and strives to get the information across to the student in an effective manner."
1115,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: absolutely!. :: Yes, he is exceptionally fair and clearly defines what he wants for every assignment. :: Yes. :: Yes, I believe Dr. Menart was very fair and expected an appropriate amount of performance from the students. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, very fair grader. :: Yes, all work required for the course was fully laid out in the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Our work was evaluated as he said it would be. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1116,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: always started on time, sometimes didn't let us out until a bit late, but that's ok. :: Class always started on time and occasionally ran long, but never more than 10 minutes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Menart made very good use of class time every lecture. Even on the days he ran a little over time, he was appreciative of the students for staying to complete the lesson. This meant a lot to me. :: yes. :: yse. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, every class. :: Yes, he would show up early to class to prepare and would end almost exactly when the class was supposed to. :: exactly. :: yes. :: yes always. :: Yes. :: Yes. Dr. Menart always used the full class period, if not more than that, but time in class was never wasted. :: yes. :: He was always on time and used the full period. He ran over less in this class than when I had him for another class. :: Yes"
1117,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- good. :: Very descriptive examples. :: always!. :: Routinely asks questions to the class that encouraged critical thinking and demonstration of knowledge of the subject. :: Very open office hours. Interacting in class. :: Dr. Menart was readily available for any questions that the students had. I could tell that he was very genuine in helping his students. :: he was very interested. :: Provided very detailed lectures. :: Good. :: Answered questions to the best of his knowledge. :: Yes. :: absolutely. :: By interactive class. :: Seems to be the most invested in the success of the students of any professor I have ever had. :: He showed the class many interesting articles and resources about wind power and tried to tie together each subject to the last. :: yes. :: good. :: he always ask questions in the class.In that way we are always connected to the course of studies and we are able to remember  the things we have forgotten from previous learning. :: Mostly at personal level. :: If there is ever a question or a problem Dr. Menart does not hesitate to do what he can to handle it. If I had any concerns I felt comfortable going to him for help. :: very informative, use course book content and will combined examples. :: By giving challenging and tricky assignments."
1118,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: Very effectively. :: amazing!. :: Very effectively and the addition of recorded lectures allowed the ability to revisit previous content for reviews, which was a huge aid in studying. :: Very effectively. :: Dr. Menart was very clear in communication with his students at all times. All emails that he sent out were clear and easy to understand. :: good. :: He always available when I need him. :: Very Well. :: Good. :: Very well. :: Very good. Always available and takes effort to clarify all questions. :: Very approachable. :: Efficiently. :: Good. :: Very well. Very fast at responding to questions outside of class. :: Very well. Although there were a few problems with assigning homework and not discussing the material it was over, so he would push the homework back right when it was due. :: if we have questions, we can talk with Dr. Menart on class or talk with him on the office hours. :: Effective. :: Yes he is very good,Always responded to my queries in classroom and helped me out of the classroom too. :: Very effective and helpful in both classroom and outside communication. :: Very effectively. I truly enjoyed the online lecture option and that they could be accessed at any time of the day. :: 10/10. :: Generally speaking he responded to email questions quickly and was helpful whenever a question was asked in class."
1119,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes a lot of valuable content was taught through it. :: very well. :: Yes. :: Yes. Very. :: Yes, all content was easy to access in Pilot and the course progression followed the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Notes didn't exactly flow with lectures, but it was manageable. :: Yes. :: Well organised. :: Yes. :: Spent more time on the mechanics part then any other section, we probably could've got farther. :: Very much so. :: Yes, though he sometimes struggled to reference things from his notes. Should consider keeping note of where specific important things are in the prepared notes. :: yes. :: They were excellent and systematic. :: Yes they are very well organised. :: Yes. :: Yes. The course followed a lesson plan that made sense when discussing wind power. We built upon the subjects in the first chapter and now even chapter one makes more sense than it did initially. :: yes. :: I think they were organized. Sometimes Dr. Menart would get a bit off on a tangent that was related. This is the primary reason for us being slightly behind topics in the class. That being said, he got off topic because he was very interested in the subject matter and was trying to get more information across to us students. :: Yes"
1120,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes! every time i needed help, we was there. :: More so than most. Even went so far as to respond to emails on the weekend concerning course work and would answer questions whenever available including outside of office hours. :: Yes. Responded to emails very quickly, provided they were well composed. :: Yes, I never had any problems contacting Dr. Menart. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: YEs. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always. :: Yes, he responded quickly when emailed and was routinely available in his office even though he was busy. Did a good job of answering all questions asked. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, I personally met him though appointments,He is always so helpful. :: Yes. :: Absolutely. I only had one issue during the class and Dr. Menart handled it immediately. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1121,James Menart,2016 Spring,ME 4560,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Very well done class. :: There is not much to say.. he is just a great professor! you can tell that this is what he likes to do! keep it going Dr. Menart. :: Thank you for a well thought out and executed course. It is refreshing to walk into a class and have such a clear idea of what the course will entail and what is expected of you as a student. I can say that such an experience has been a rarity among other engineering classes. :: I should have gone for the renewable energy Masters. Prof. Menart is pretty excellent. :: Dr. Menart was the best professor I have had at Wright State. Throughout my time at college, I had heard he was a good professor, but I never had the chance to sign up for one of his classes. I finally got that chance my last semester of school, and I was not disappointed. Thank you Dr. Menart. :: no. :: No. :: Good instructor. :: I think the class hour should be atleast 1.5 hours; it was just for an hour and so, he would take atleast 10 minutes to review the previous lecture and that was helpful but I felt like it took too much time and could cover very less materials for the day. :: Dr. Menart is a great professor. He seems genuinely invested in the success of the students, and cares that they take something away from his class. This makes learning his material much easier. :: Great job, though try to reorganize material slightly to get through more of it. We were many lectures behind by the end of the semester. :: i like his class. he is a nice professor. :: I hope he takes more classes in renewable and clean energy 7000 level courses, such as advanced thermodynamics 7500. :: no. :: The Instructor can add more practical aspects about the course. :: I want to reiterate that I really enjoyed that the lectures were posted online, especially since this was an 8 am class and I work late nights. It was great to be able to watch them at will if I could not make it to class and to be able to go back over them while studying for test or completing homework. Dr. Menart was a great instructor and I feel like I learned a lot this semester. The test were very hard for me to achieve high marks on but it pushed me to try my best to really learn the material. :: very good course and professor. :: Dr. Menart is a great teacher. I would have to say hands down he was the best teacher that I have had here at Wright State. He is always helpful to students by posting notes and lectures online. His grading is fair.  The only negative that I can think of is that the first part of each test is a closed book, closed notes portion. Sometimes (not always) I feel like this is more of a trivia section than an engineering test. I also would have liked to see only material from the lecture or HW on the test. He would occasionally put in material from his own notes (which he does supply to us) but which I don't remember covering in the class period or on the HW.  Thanks Dr. Menart. :: No"
1122,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- e. :: Fairly good. :: Dr. Farajian was not the best professor I've had at Wright State. He seems to have little interest in his students' learning and doesn't receive (answer) questions well. My impression was that he is a little condescending and expects too much last-minute from his students. :: He was there when consultation was needed as well as to answer questions. :: Lectures were well spent. :: Very effective, knew the material well. :: Very clear explanations. Utilized the textbook to provide better understanding. :: As far as the MME department, there are many areas for improvement both in administrative and academic roles. Dr. Farajian is one example. Dr. Farajian is the only professor that I know of that has taught this course. I have heard from MSE alumni that they have lost interest in the electrical properties of materials due to the fact that there is not a professor that has been able to teach the content effectively. Dr. Farajian should rethink his teaching methods and observe how the physics department teaches the introductory PHY 2410 Physics II course. A recitation component to this course would prove beneficial. Perhaps Dr. Farajian should consider only teaching graduate level courses due to the fact that he presents 25% of the information and leaves the other 75% to the student to figure out. Additionally, if the overall performance of the class is poor, that should directly reflect on the instructor's teaching ability. If teaching ability and class performance were satisfactory, this would negate the need for extra credit assignments. It appears that Dr. Farajian is more concerned with his research and professional image than WSU's most important objective: providing a world class education. It is for these reasons that I will pursue a career in metallurgy instead of electrical, thermal, optical, or magnetic materials science disciplines."
1123,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- e. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian evaluated the (2) exams, term paper, and presentation for this course, but we have only received one exam grade, so it is difficult to say that he really evaluated my work according to the syllabus. The assignments throughout the course did not match up with the syllabus. The grading according to the syllabus was as follows: ""Grading: Homework 20%, Term paper: 20%, Midterm Exam: 30%, Final Exam: 30% (Final exam is not accumulative)."" However, we had extra quizzes and a presentation that were not clearly accounted for in the grade, so I am not sure what weight either of those had in deciding my grade. Additionally, the final exam did draw on concepts from the beginning of the semester (Exam 1 material), and required equations from the previous test.  I was also very disappointed that a main concept that was supposed to be taught during this course (Magnetic Properties of Materials) was completely skipped. This was one of the 5 main concepts that were supposed to be taught over the course of this semester. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was fair. :: Yes, evaluation was based on expected criterion provided in the syllabus. :: Grades are determined by homework, the midterm exam, the term paper, and will be based on the final exam; however, Dr. Farajian did not include how he was going to grade unannounced ""quizzes"" or a final presentation. The syllabus divides the final grade into the following: Homework 20%, Term paper: 20%, Midterm Exam: 30%, Final Exam: 30% (Final exam is not accumulative). Nowhere does it mention how quizzes or a presentation will be weighed in grade calculation. If an assignment is going to occur, make sure that it is clearly defined in all parts of the syllabus on the first day of class. The term paper guidelines were never clearly established as being a summary of current findings in research or as a literature survey. It should be noted that in the syllabus it states that magnetic properties of materials will be covered, but the topic was never addressed. The homework grader was inconsistent on grading when students used the exact same method to solve problems yet received varying grades."
1124,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- e. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian had a tendency to be a couple minutes late, but always used the full class period. :: Yes. :: Lecture always ended right at the end of the class period, but often times started 5-10 minutes late. :: Sometimes was a few minutes late. But most of the time was punctual. :: Yes all class time was spent wisely. Lectures, group assignments etc. :: Much like how Dr. Farajian was late to ME 4860 Computational Materials Science in Fall 2015, he was often late to the noon ME 4700 class."
1125,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He actively challenged our understanding by having us write explanations on the board. :: I didn't feel there was a strong interest in my learning. :: Yes. :: By relating the material to real world applications. :: Encouraged in-class discussion and participation. Welcomed questions. :: Group discussion was a major aspect of generating interest among students and it worked really well. :: Dr. Farajian failed to demonstrate interest in my learning due to his condescending demeanor towards undergraduate students. Students were apprehensive of answering questions due to experiencing repercussions and being insulted for not knowing how to answer his obscurely stated questions.
1126,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- e. :: He was a pretty strong teacher. Some of the letters got to be tough to distinguish. Try not to repeat letters in the same section or make them distinctive. :: Dr. Farajian is not a very friendly person. In the classroom, he seems to enjoy belittling students when they cannot answer his convoluted and unclear questions. Outside of the classroom, he acts like he does not know his students, and the door to his office is always closed. :: He was fast at communication outside of the classroom and inside of the classroom he went in depth to answer your questions. :: Well, sent out reminder emails for assignments etc. :: Very well, no issues. :: Quite effectively. :: Dr. Farajian would often state questions using confusing jargon, and when a student failed to answer correctly he would insult his or her intelligence and correct them in a condescending manner. This behavior has been shown in a previous class, ME 4860, and is only displayed towards undergraduates."
1127,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- e. :: Yes. :: There were several classes where Dr. Farajian came into class late and didn't seem to know where he was going with his lectures. A lot of what was ""taught"" was derivations that would never be used again. Towards the end it seemed like he was only writing equations on the board, which wasn't very helpful. I wish he had done more practice problems in class, or at least gave practical application cases. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The lectures were structured on the fly. His lectures followed the textbook, but he failed to give cohesive examples and simply copied equations from the book without fully explaining how the science reached aforementioned equation. It should be mentioned that exam contents were supposed to be pulled from class examples and homework problems and be implemented in a ""plug-and-chug"" fashion, yet they were not."
1128,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- e. :: Yes. :: No. :: yes. :: Yes. :: YEs. :: Dr. Farajian responded to emails in a prompt fashion."
1129,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 4700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- e. :: No. :: nope. :: No. :: A recitation component to this course would prove beneficial and enhance further understanding due to shortcomings of the professor. :: no"
1130,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Description is good, but how practically applicable is a big doubt. :: 6/10 The things that he did explain I understood, however there were significant portions of material that were glossed over and then expected to be understood with no indication that the content was needed for future work. :: The overall effectiveness of the instructor was good. :: The subject itself was very rough and the textbook used wasnt helpful; written in very high language and having doen the prerequisites prior to this subject was absolutely of no help. And so, the proffessor was not very good at throwing out the messege. :: the instructor was fairly effective in the instruction of the class due to the great depth of explanation that was involved with relevant course information. :: Good. :: Good. :: good. :: Good. :: It suppose to be excellent. :: Good. :: It was 7000 level class so it was very tough but still professor taught this subject with very efficient way. He is one of the best professor for me. :: He was good in explaining and making people understand. :: Made the subject interesting. :: Lectures were okay. :: Good professor. Clear at explaining concepts and examples. :: Excellent. :: Excellent. :: Instructor was able to deliver the lectures with practical examples. :: Good at knowledge. Welcomes questions and eager to clarify doubts regarding the concept. :: Good but should take some time in explaining the concept. :: Very mathematical treatment but that is to be expected for this class.  Overall good.  A few more physical applications and a look at real-world data to validate the model results would help. :: EXCELLENT. :: He good in explaining the concepts. :: He is good in teaching. :: Between 1 to 5. Where 5 is most effective and 1 least effective. 5. :: He was very effective on the derivations of the concepts. :: excellent. :: good. :: Decent in expressing the views. :: he is good. :: overall very good. :: Instructor was effective."
1131,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- according to 1st mid exam.  I am not satisfied. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes the course expectations were adhered to and laid out as described in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The course was too lengthy contained 8 chapters; it coveres every single aspects what I was looking for. The course seems perfect and professor also gave justice to it. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes, everything was fair. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. The evaluation was good. :: Yes. :: Yes.  Syllabus was well laid out and followed closely. :: YES. :: Yes. He taught us as described in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor evaluated my based on the expectations. :: yes. :: Yes. :: the topic is very hard,Instructor did his best to describe. :: yes. :: Yes"
1132,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: class was routinely started on time and all time for each period was fully utilized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he use full class period. :: Yes. :: The professor expecting to class start on time and use full class period. He always comes on or before time and use the class time perfectly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: All the classes started were on time and were ended on time. :: Yes he'll use the full time and be puntual always. :: Yes.  However, there is a real problem with students coming in up to 10 minutes late.  In one case 40 minutes late when a particularly difficult homework assignment was due.  Don't know how much power the instructor has to regulate this but it is surprising in a 7000-level class. :: YES. :: Yes, he was punctual and used the class period effectively. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the class starts on time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
1133,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- good. :: Somewhat. He would ask questions to keep people engaged, however this was not done frequently and when done usually focused on the basic concepts so there was no indication that higher level content was understood. :: good. :: I honestly think I learned nothing out of this subject. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in our learning by having us complete group tasks that were geared towards reinforcing our knowledge of the key concepts. :: Average. :: Good. :: not bad. :: Not good. :: By giving home works and keeping inclass. :: By smart quizzes. :: He provides examples during the class, team tasks was interesting. Also, he provided basline of each topic so it was easy to understand purpose of each topic at the end. :: By giving good examples and kept few surprise tests as well. :: Good. :: Made it difficult. :: Always asked if there were any questions. Was interested in having everyone learn. :: He helps to know the subject in the easy methods. :: By explaining different things. :: by linking the lectures with the real time applications. :: Used to give really good examples to make the concept clear and the session was all interactive. :: Based on our group tasks done and the assignments. :: Moderately good.  He stopped frequently to ensure that the class was following him.  At other times the storm of equations got moving a bit thick and fast. :: EXTREMELY SATISFIED. :: His idea of giving extra credits for answering the questions in the class created interest in learning the course. :: Professor demonstrated it very well with examples. :: Asked us questions during class.Responded emails. Provided office hours. :: Good. :: by giving more examples. :: He notices each and every student and understands the levels of participation. :: by  group assignments. :: group tasks , live examples. :: By team-tasks."
1134,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Nicely. :: 6/10 If asked a question over the topic that he was not prepared for he would either work through the problem with the class, which was nice, or simply dismiss the question as irrelevant or something that is not worth investigating further. :: Good. :: ok. :: the instructor effectively communicated both in and out of class to assist us on the points we may have not fully understood in each topic from the course. :: Good. :: Good. :: not bad. :: In class it's okay but out of the class he never communicate well. :: He communicates well. :: Effective enough. :: Professor has effective study skills; During his class he ask every student for any doubt and also free to give enough explanation on qunestion. :: He gave extra time for the students even after the class. :: Took great amount of effort in communicating. :: In class fine, out of class, it was a nightmare to track him down. :: Good communication. Responded to emails and was available outside of class. :: Excellent. :: Good. :: he was able to communicate well in and outside of the class room. :: There was no barrier or hurdle for the communication. Everything was straight and simple. :: He is good and give reply to the mail at late night.. :: Communication was good. :: EXCELLENT. :: He is good. :: Yes the communication with professor is very good. :: Between 1 to 5. Where 5 is most effective and 1 least effective. 5. :: In class well. No experience out of class. :: Good. :: goood. :: Good. :: yes he always gave information via email or pilot whenever there was needed. :: yes. :: Very effective and helpful in both classroom and outside communication."
1135,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not organized early. :: Vaguely followed the syllabus and seemed to jump around a good deal, however aside from that the lectures were fairly straight forward and to the point. :: Yes. :: well organised but not effective. :: yes the course was well organized and had a logical flow and build up for each concept into the next one. :: Good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: They are organised well. :: Yes. :: Yes the course content and lectures were really well organized. We were following his notes and book for this subject and it was easy to understand his notes compare to textbook. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes and they are well planned. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. All the chapters in the course all well organized. :: There should be more elaboration on the concepts which are important. :: All of the information from Carey was well organized.  The one chapter from Swalin seemed a bit rushed.  Since this material came at the very end of the term I suggest that it be dropped from the syllabus or moved forward to allow some problems to be worked. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, they were well organized. :: yes. :: Perfectly organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: Almost"
1136,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: He would answer emails, but for office hours if was difficult to always find him in his office during scheduled times. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes the instructor was reasonably available for consultation. :: Excellent. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he is avaliable and responsive. :: Yes. :: Professor is very helpful and friendly.

1137,Amir Farajian,2016 Spring,ME 7500,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Course work should be with multiple examples in the class professor is very stringent on his exam date.  Required to be flexible some times due to having multiple exams. :: If a little more time was taken to explain the finer details of certain concepts and less time on less complex subjects the class would be much better. Examples of topics are also helpful when the in text examples of the book are somewhat lacking. :: No. :: I only took this subject because it was mandatory, and was a total waste of money. I have done subjects which might not have been to relevent to what my career line is going, but this was one subject I learned absolutely nothing. :: No. :: No. :: no. :: No. :: He produced us good concept. :: Nothing. :: I really recommend to take subject under this professor, he is such a kind and genuine professor. :: I am completely satisfied and have no complaints except for if he can reduce the weight-age to the mid exam which is equal to the final exam. :: None. :: The final exam did not reflect what we had learned in class. :: No. :: no. :: No Comments. :: Overall this was a good course.  The instructor clearly likes the subject.  Because the material builds on itself so much it takes half of the term to really start seeing how this approach can be useful.  A bit more foreshadowing of how Chapter 1 leads to Chapter 5 would probably pay off.   The in-class groups at first looked like they might take away valuable class time that could have been used to learn more material.  However, these exercises totaled up to about one class worth of time (~75 min total for 5 in-class problems).  I think the groups helped focus attention and as a nice side benefit I got to meet some of my fellow students who I otherwise would not know. :: NO. :: No. :: No Comments on this professor at all. He is very well organized. :: No. :: no. :: None. :: no. :: The Instructor can add more practical aspects about the course."
1138,Henry Young,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Henry Young was a very enthusiastic and personable professor that did a very good job of lecturing and making the material sound interesting. :: very ineffective. at the beginning of the year it was expressed that many example problems would be done in class, hardly an problems were done, as class was winding down. also the homework did not contribute at all to my learning in the class. being that it is an engineering class, there should be some useful problems that should be availible for the student in order for them to be able to study for the exam. :: Great job. :: Dr. Young was effective while teaching the course. :: I enjoyed hoe Dr. Young ran the class. Sometimes though, I felt like we went too in depth, or spent too much lecture time on a topic that wasn't on any of the exams and didnt seem relevant. :: Good. The examples given in class were helpful and I loved knowing exactly what questions would be on the exam, but I feel like many concepts were repeated ad nauseam and about three different ways. To save time, I would suggest describing processes or examples on way, and then if there are questions, expound. :: Good instructor. :: Dr. Young is very effective at presenting information to the class. :: Very thorough in his explanations. He's obviously excited about the material. :: great. :: great teacher. :: the instructor was very helpful with my understanding of the course. :: The instructor was very good at explaining the material presented in the class and was overall very effective for me in his teaching method. :: Fantastic. :: Good. :: Very good at teaching this subject, very enthusiastic about the material. :: Not very. :: Dr. Young made the class interesting by explaining the material and relating it to real world applications.  He also help prepare students for what is going to be on the exam. He also went over example problems when needed."

There were a couple days he was a few minutes late, but for the most part yes. :: yes. :: Yes and yes. :: He uses every minute to teach us, and he likes when we ask questions during the lecture. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes that was very bothersome he needs to stop calculating how much time he has left. :: He made very good use of all class time and was never late to the point where it shortened the class by any significant amount. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: always on time and usually ran over with more info. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was always on time."

He will pause and make eye contact with every single person in the class before continuing. :: x. :: yes. :: he was very enthusiastic about teaching this course and focused on the major points of this course. :: He demonstrated interest in my learning by making time to answer any questions I had during class and after class. :: By answering questions. :: applied the concepts to real world applications. :: He didn't. :: He went over examples in class and allowed students to have copy of power point slides.  For me it was nice because I would take notes from lecture off the powerpoint slides.  Help to understand harder concepts.  He also took time to explain the material."
1142,Henry Young,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did very well with communicating with us outside of class (as well as in class). :: always had a class agenda each week which was helpful to know hwat was going on and what was due each week. :: Answered any questions in a reasonable amount of time. :: He communicated well in class. :: Communicated well, but some words were switched at times, I noticed. For example, if a term was supposed to be melting temperature, he might have said freezing temperature. :: Very nice. :: Dr. Young was effective at communication with the class by making an agenda for us to follow that presented the class structure and his expectations. :: Very well. I needed help once and sent him an email. He returned my email with a phone call and was able to help me. :: easy to communicate with. :: He is friendly in and out class. :: yes. :: he gave us his email and anytime we had questions he would answer them in class or by email. :: He was very good at communicating in class and directly after class, however it was more difficult to reach him through e-mail. :: well. :: always went over the schedule for the next few classes at the beginning of class, kept pilot up to date with info. :: I don't know. :: Dr. Young was excellent he was available to students after class and he would answer email quickly."

I would suggest an outline before class to make sure you know what you want to discuss so you save time not searching for slides. :: Yes. :: Yes. Dr. Young was well prepared for class with power points and the ability to lecture seamlessly. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes they were. :: Yes, the course content seemed to be very well organized and all lectures went smoothly. :: yes. :: Very straight forward, easy to follow. :: Not really. :: Yes, the powerpoint were available and would give answers to homework, so if you didn't understand something it would help the student understand what they did wrong."

Dr. Young was always willing to answer a question. :: Yes. I contacted him during office hours on the phone. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he was. :: Aside from a few e-mails, I did not contact the instructor outside of class so I cannot really comment. :: don't know. :: Always responsive to emails, I did not visit office hours. :: Never used them. :: Yes"
1145,Henry Young,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Henry Young always had a positive attitude and a smile on his face..it made it easy to come to class. :: if this guy was put into a regular class room, instead of one of the huge lecture halls in the student success center, i truly believe he could teach the course a lot better. :: I feel like the quizzes should be work 5% less than they are and put more emphasis on the exams. Since the quiz questions show up on the  exams, and that is where supposed ot be an evaluation of how you are learning the material, there should be less of a punishment to your grade if you miss them the first time. Also, the TA seemed to be pretty picky when grading homework towards the start of the semester. :: No. Thank you. :: No. :: I look forward to having Dr. Young for more classes in the future. :: He's okay. :: no. :: no. :: no. :: He showed enthusiasm during class that made the lectures more enjoyable to listen to and take part in. I was very pleased with how the class was handled during the semester and would recommend this instructor to others who have the opportunity to take one his classes. :: no. :: provocative attire distracted from class content. :: Quizzes covered a bit too much for one quiz, made it a bit more difficult to learn all the material. :: I would have liked more examples in class the help understand the material. :: I really enjoyed Dr. Young class.  He was able to take pressure off the student for exams and quizzes by preparing them for what he expected  the student to learn.  My opinion this made it better and was easier for the student to learn without out the constant pressure of exams.   Dr. young also opened my eyes of material science and the important role it has for engineering.  I look forward to having another class with him."

1162,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Spring,ME 4240,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give the instructor a 9. The instructor has used every classroom resources available to him to demonstrate his point, which I personally found very effective. He has a sound command over the course material and has this knowledge to the fullest. :: good. :: alright. :: All we learned was matlab and the instructor just gave us packets to copy for matlab. :: very ineffective, learned hardly anything. :: q. :: Dr. Lieh was very effective. :: Good. :: eh!. :: Negligible. Tries to explain things but when you voice that you don't understand a subject matter, he repeats what he just said.. But louder. You quickly learn to stay silent in your lack of understanding or to nod your head yes when asked if you understand because someone else in the class will be able to explain it better and more clearly to you later. Fellow students were more understanding and patient teachers of the subject that Lieh was. :: Dr. Lieh has a particular teaching style that is very ineffective.  He knows the material very well and I assume that he believes it to be easy.  Because of this, he rarely took the time to actually teach us anything.  He consistently had us copy MATLAB and Simulink codes and programs that he never fully explained, and then believed that we were to understand it purely based off of copying it down as quickly as we could.  When we weren't copying code, we were basically looking at graphs and equations that were never fully explained, and then it was back to copying code.  I basically learned very little in this class and I couldn't actually prove to anyone that I learned anything.  I understand there is a language barrier, but he also has the tendency to get louder if you express that you don't understand something.  He does not attempt to explain it in a different way, he just increases his volume until the students, including me, would just say that they understood in order to make him stop shouting.  He is a very nice person, and he is funny and interesting as well, but this class needs a serious overhaul if Wright State wishes for its engineers to be properly trained in ""Vehicle Engineering."". :: ok. :: very good. :: good. :: the instructor needs to explain the material more deeply instead of going over it quickly and have us copy codes into MATLAB without telling us what each things does or why it's used. :: THE INSTRUCTOR IS VERY ENERGETIC AND MADE ME PAY ATTENTION TO HIM ALL THE TIME. :: The professor was unable to get information to students effectively. :: Makes me want to kill myself. He says it many times in class (at least once a week). Cannot focus or learn from him: yelling does not help. :: Dr. Lieh was effective at getting the material across in a easily understandable way. :: Very good. :: good. :: Excellent communication ,. :: The overall effectiveness is good. :: NOT Effective. :: very good. :: Not good. His teaching style was very confusing. :: Excellent. :: I think this is an instructor who is very intelligent, but does not quite understand how students learn. :: The overall effectiveness of Dr. Lieh is good, but still room for improvement. :: good. :: Dr. Lieh, Has a lot of knowledge but he need to be respectful with the students. He always ignore the students. I will not take any courses with him any more and the last things he connote control the class. :: Not very effective. :: very good. :: Yes. :: has good knowledge on the vehicle system but fails to explain it in an effective way to  the students. instead of teaching concepts he concentrated more on programming which was already printed and circulated to the students. :: EXCELLENT. :: He is excellent. :: Excellent. :: very positive. :: He is good at explanation. :: great. :: he is good and clear."

We never turned anything in by paper, or if we did it was very few and far between. :: Yes, in a sense.  Our work was mostly evaluated on completion, which is fine with me because I rarely knew the material well enough to actually get anything right.  And this wasn't just me, this was maybe twenty to thirty other students that I spoke to.  None of us learned anything in this class. :: kind of. :: yes. :: yes. :: I'm not sure if he did or not as we never got any feedback on any of the tests or assignments except for grades.

I always have. :: provide interesting topics to learn. :: He let students made a report and presentations that were related to engineering applications in real life. :: Yes. :: He didn't really. :: He seemed very interested in my learning and was helpful when I had questions, although he sometimes tried to answer your question before you were done asking it and therefore missed what you were actually asking. :: good lectures. :: I couldn't understand his accent when he is normal, however he always yelling at the class to trying catch the attention of the students.. :: He didn't. :: explains very well. :: Passionate. :: students do not concentrate in class and the professor has no control. :: WONDERFUL. :: Yes. :: good. :: Excellently. :: by clarifying the doubts. :: he asked us to perform a lot of in class work which help[ed us a lot."

The communication was very fluent and he did not use any words or sentences that he knows would be difficult for the student to comprehend. :: good. :: no communication. :: none. :: poorly. :: q. :: Dr. Lieh communicated with students well. :: Good. :: not very well, actually pretty bad. :: In-class? Negligible communication effectiveness. Out-of-class? N/A. I learned not to try. :: In the classroom it was terrible.  His communication style is completely ineffective.  He rambled a lot without actually teaching us anything.  Outside of the classroom, it was also ineffective.  He refuses to use pilot so never knew what our grades were.  We could email him about the grades if we wanted, but we never got anything handed back in class.  I got one grade report the entire semester.  I don't even know what grade I got on the second exam, the final project, or any of the homework assignments past the first few.  It was absolutely ridiculous because I could technically be failing this course and I wouldn't know until he submits the grades to Wright State. :: ok. :: yes. :: good. :: well. :: ALWAYS THERE FOR QUESTIONS. :: I was regularly confused about what was due when. :: Terrible communication. Could not verify grades or get feedback on any homework. :: Very effectively. :: Very good. :: good. :: Excellent communication in vlass. :: He communicates well. :: If you needed help, He is there. :: very effective. :: Poorly. His teaching style was very confusing even though he provided a lot of in-class papers to help us understand the materials. :: Excellent>. :: Not all that well. :: Very well. He responded via email in a timely manner. :: perfect. :: No communication at all.. :: Somewhat effective. :: very good. :: Effective. :: bad. :: EXTRA ORDINARY. :: He gave appointment when asked for. :: good. :: Very good. :: very effictively. :: he is very supportive and never says no to any question asked. :: very nicely."
1167,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Spring,ME 4240,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I feel the course content could be a little more organized. Also, the instructor can use Pilot to upload the class notes instead of printing out the handouts. :: good. :: yes. :: yeah kind of.  The lecture was pointless to go to.  If there weren't any in-class exercises I probably wouldn't have gone to class. :: no. :: q. :: Yes. :: yes. :: no. :: Not particularly. :: Not at all.  Other than the fact that he had all his slides printed out for us, there was seemingly no rhyme or reason for anything that he did during his lectures.  It was a complete waste of time as far as I am concerned. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: no. :: YES. :: Not even a little bit. It was always scrambling and trial by fire. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Well organized from first class. :: Yes, they are organized well. :: Yes. Powerpoint and slides. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Yes, the power-points were very well organized and the handouts contained all of the material needed. :: NO. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: course content is organized. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes, they were well organized. :: yes. :: yes very well. :: yes they were. :: yes. he gave well organised notes."
1168,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Spring,ME 4240,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: good. :: no. :: yeah kind of. :: yes. :: q. :: Yes. :: for the most time. :: N/A. Didn't try. :: I never tried, there was no point. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: YES. :: He seemed to. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.Explains very effectively. :: Yes, he is responsible. :: Just set up an appointment. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was. :: Some times. :: yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he did respond to every query whether it was in class or online. :: yes. Always responsive and helpful."
1169,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Spring,ME 4240,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I feel the instructor should change the method of his evaluation because the class for this course consists of both under-graduates and graduates. Judging them both on a common ground level is unfair according to me. Also, I feel he should use Pilot more often because I didn't see him utilize this tool for this course. We had to e-mail every in-class exercise to the teaching assistant. If he can just ask to submit our work on some kind of 'Dropbox' on Pilot, that would be great. Printing out this many handouts is surely a huge wastage of paper when he has the resources to go green. :: good. :: no. :: no. :: Class time was poorly spent, nothing was learned in this course. Projects were difficult due to lack of material in class. :: q. :: nope. :: No. :: i can tell he has way too many things on his plate! please drop some off of him so he can teach better. :: Someone needs to start sitting in on some of these classes at Wright State.  This school is being hurt by teachers who have fallen into a tenure slump and care more about research and publishing papers than anything else.  This class was a total waste of my time. :: no. :: no. :: no. :: use pilot to upload grades and handouts. :: NO. :: System should be required to take this class. The content of this class is essentially an easier for of systems but with poor explanation. :: Fire this guy please. :: Overall a good class and professor. :: No. :: no. :: I'll enjoy his teaching and class will be active. :: no. :: No. :: No. :: I thought these lectures were too rushed, with the emphasis on busy work rather than learning. :: Thanks. :: Mention that this course uses Matlab and simulink in the course description. Also, because of the Simulink aspect of this course, and the assumption made by the Professor that you understand simulink, there should be a course beforehand that covers this. Dr. Lieh mentioned that Simulink was covered in Matlab (Just took it a few semesters ago, was never taught in the course) and that you also do it in system dynamics, which I have not taken. If knowledge of Simulink for this course is required, why was it NOT disclosed by the university. This has been one of the biggest failures of a course I have taken at Wright State. I really hope the university will look over this course and its requirements, and institute pre-reqs as necessary. Dr. Lieh cannot teach Simulink, you MUST understand it before taking this course. Being a huge car guy, and wanting to be a design engineer for the automotive industry I thought this would be a good course. Overall it was not an effective use of my time and money. :: no. :: No. :: none. :: NO. :: No. :: no. :: Its really great class for my major. Its help me a lot for that. :: no. professor is good. :: Good professor."
1170,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Engages the students within class very well, great lecturer. :: not bad. :: Great. :: Horrible. He spent most lectures talking about how he wouldn't want to teach and so he would just tell us to do an example problem that not explained how to do. :: The professor's teaching could be more effective. Not enough time spent on solving examples from the book. More time spent in MATLAB would be nice too. :: Slater is a good professor.  Often, he would give a very simple example and then expect us to do a very complicated problem by ourselves with only the very simple example to go off of.  The problem would be that we would have no idea how to do the problem and would spend most of the class being clueless.  Other than those instances, his teaching is very effective. :: Good, really tried to engage with the class and make it interesting. Made it way easier to try and pay attention to a subject that I found some difficulties with. :: Not good. Have to learn on your own. :: bad. :: Not good, there was no instruction. Class time was spent telling us the things we should already know, and then the next lecture he would breeze over things saying, ""we covered this last lecture"". He was never straight forward with the things we should know and never finished any examples he started, which then made figuring out what he wanted on quizzes a pain. I dont think he really looked at any of the homework he assigned because he never seemed to know how to solve it. :: Very effective. :: actual application related to the ultimate education purpose. :: Very effective. :: Once we got into the core content of the course he became an effective instructor, however, in the first couple weeks when he wasn't teaching us ""new information"" he tended to waste class time. This is ok for those who have a solid grasp on the previous courses, but for those who could have used more of a refresher it was an inconvenience. As someone who teeters in-between I would like to see more information presented about the topics involved in thermo-fluid flow and how they affect systems. :: I'm a big fan of Slater personality wise.  He's top 3 professors I've had at Wright State but this class requires so much explanation and clarification it's hard for anyone to really teach. :: Not sure that I would call it effective. :: Slater was very effective. He engaged the class and did a good job making the material clear, answered questions well, and kept a lighthearted attitude throughout the semester which made the class enjoyable as well as productive. :: This teacher is very effective at conveying material in understandable English. However, he could've been more effective if he provided answers to in-class problems, and solutions to homeworks. :: His teaching style was OK with me. He needs to provide tutoring or recitation to students. :: Dr. Slater does an excellent job of simplifying complicated material in an easy to understand manner. He keeps students interested during lecture by using his sense of humor. :: good. :: I thought the instructor was fairly effective when he tried to be. He did a better job than most in terms of keeping the class's attention. I thought he could have given more complicated examples in class. He seemed to give the simplest example and expect the rest to be learned outside of class. :: Was more effective in small groups like the office hours or personal meetings. :: The professor was very helpful. He made a point to be available for office hours as much as possible, even taking time to answer questions via email when not in office hours. Explained dynamics well enough that I left with a better understanding than after I took the actual dynamics class. His teaching simplified what otherwise would have been a very difficult course. His teaching style was entertaining enough so that I did not have too much trouble paying attention. :: The overall effectiveness of Dr. Slater is very good. I learned a lot in class, although the homework was sometimes a little long. :: He was entertaining and covered a lot of information. :: I do not believe the instructor was effective at all. His teaching style was sporadic and he never really seemed to have a defined process for the course. :: Explained topics well, always gave clear answers to questions, and knows how to keep students interested. :: He shows the key points of System Dynamics and the most necessary content. :: Dr. Slater was effective, examples were relevant and homework was appropriate and helped with the understanding of the class as a whole.  His teaching style was what I prefer, a traditional lecture style class with guidance through relevant examples. One of the more effective professors I have had during my time at Wright State. Dr. Slater was more than willing to help in office hours. :: Very Knowledgeable, great professor!. :: I felt as though Dr. Slater did not teach this class well. He often times would show us the simple steps of something and immediately jump to complicated problem and expect us to know how to solve it. :: good. :: Great personality, however as a professor, I believe he should care more about if the students actually understand the material rather than just advising them to go to office hours with a large crowd. :: Effective."
1171,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: no. :: No, grading was incredibly inconsistent, and there was never a set syllabus so no one ever knew what to study. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I thought it was realistic. I don't understand the usefulness of professionalism points. :: Yes, he was true to his syllabus. :: He didn't even know what he was doing half the time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, his evaluation of my work and the syllabus lined up very well. :: Im not sure how he even breaks up the syllabus and the grading. :: That is hard to say since the syllabus is not well defined itself, when you create a category called ""quizzes and final exam"" and make that category worth 80% he can literally do whatever he choices with our grades and we have no idea where we stand. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The expectations were not well laid out for this class in my opinion. He would change how many quizzes dropped, tell us that there was a professionalism grade, no grades ever posted, and would tell us that all grades could be changed from future grades. :: yes. :: yes. :: Correct"
1172,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- always. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes class started and ended as it was supposed to. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Definitely. :: no. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes,always on time. :: Yes. :: Yes, but he often would take large chunks of class time to tell stories that were not often useful to the topic at hand. He would often say, ""I don't have time to do this problem in class. Come see me in my office hours."" which is fair to those who could make his office hours, however, I'm convinced more problems could be done if their was less story time. Not that the stories weren't interesting.. :: yes. :: Yes. Now the real question is that if we used the class time properly. Dr. Slater comes in and says ""I dont feel like working today"". So he puts a ridiculous problem up on the board. Takes us 99% of class just o scratch the surface. Then final 5 minutes of class, he solves it and the whole time we didn't learn anything because he fails to teach. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Never once cancelled class and never ended too early. :: Yes, class started on time and ended on time. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes, never late and used the whole period. :: yes. :: Correct"
1173,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- absolutely, he encourages all students to come to office hours and to stay in communication with him any time help is needed. :: HE ASKED US TO COME TO OFFFICE HOURS. :: Well. :: No. :: Very but the professor needs a TA to help distribute the load because there are not enough resources for all of the students questions. :: His policy on coming to office hours after not doing so well on a quiz ensured that those who needed help got it.  I think that's a useful tool. :: Very engaging, required meetings after getting 6 or less on a 10 point quiz so he could see us personally and help work out where we were having problems. Really cared about our success in the class. :: he didnt. :: badly. :: He didn't. He was kind of a jackass in class, constantly trying to make jokes that just ended up annoying people. And his ego was insufferable, mostly because he wasn't able to back it up. :: He always related the class content to real work situations. :: He brought some real example of theory or concept. :: He would make jokes to keep us interested. :: Yes, he seemed genuinely concerned that each one of his students gained an understanding of the subject and how it applied to real-life engineering principles. :: He kept things interesting for sure.  Made lots of jokes and tried to relate class material to real life work situations. :: He forced us to learn the material by ourselves in which he is paid to teach. He is a waste of the university's money. We are forced to learn the material and if we learn it wrong, which is 99% of the time due to difficult material, then we are screwed. :: One thing that Slater did that none of my other professors have done was make office hours mandatory if you didn't do well on a quiz. I got a very low score on my first quiz, and went in to see him. He pointed out what I was doing wrong and had me redo the question in his office, allowing me to fix my own mistakes and learn through experience rather than simply have the right answer explained to me. Very helpful. :: He encouraged us to come to his office hours, and was fairly helpful and approachable in them. :: He show some videos and explained a lot about the applications that are related to my in-class materials. :: Dr. Slater required students to go to office our if students did poorly on a previous quiz. There he could help reinforce the lecture material as well as get to know each student. :: by teaching. :: He insisted on the students meeting with the instructor outside of class in order to correct any learning gaps if the student received a poor grade on a quiz. :: When you did poorly on a quiz, he had you schedule a personal meeting to go over the mistakes with you. :: He made a point to respond to all emails I sent him as soon as possible. :: He demonstrated great interest in my learning of the material and was very willing to meet out of class and discuss any issues. :: He was interesting. :: He tried to make us come see him when we did poorly on his quizzes but even then he was not consistent with that process. :: Made time to help students outside of class and even office hours. :: He says always that he helps everyone in the office hours but he is more focused on checking his emails than helping. :: He was knowledgeable in the subject and often gave real world examples while working through the math/theory of problems. :: He often talked down to us and was quite rude to students. :: yes. :: Telling jokes and referring problems to real life situations. :: Highly concerned with our success."
1174,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- extremely effectively. :: Way Better than any of my other professors. He strongly strongly recommends office hours. :: When he decided to teach was fine but when he decided not to the class was awful. :: Communicated well. Good descriptions of the topics. :: Pretty well. :: Seemingly forgot to do things once class ending (such as emailing the class the simulink model worked on in class together) if not given reminders but always available for consultation within reason by setting up meetings times. Tried very hard to pick office hours that worked for most the class. :: good. :: Very poorly. :: He communicated very effectively. :: It was perfect.He has been available even out of office hours and schedule. :: Very effective. :: He did a good job of communicating through email. One suggestion, it would be helpful to post a link to your blog with the homework assignments in Pilot to act as a shortcut. This is what other professors who prefer to use their own private page have done and makes accessing homework much faster than Google-ing his name every time. :: He was available for help outside of class and did a good job trying to teach material in class. :: When i do see him he can answer everything and anything not pertinent to class or homework. As soon as I try to get him back on track to help further my understanding of a subject or homework, he doesn't give a clear explanation or he changes the topic. Its like he doesn't know the material well enough to teach. :: Fairly effectively. Sometimes Slater would put a bunch of information up on the board and then have the class do a practice problem blind, without seeing a demonstration first. This worked most of the time, and the information tended to stick better because we ""taught the material to ourselves"" rather than just copying it during a lecture. The one exception to this was the section on motors, we were taught in this manner but I don't think I really learned the material that time. :: He communicated well - until he got off topic. :: Average. :: Dr. Slater was almost always available for question whether through office hours or email. :: well. :: The instructor communicated relatively well. Again, he is a skilled professor, who I thought did not go far enough on examples in class. :: Communication was good. :: Explained most things in class very well, although a few things in the homework he never mentioned in class. For these problems, however, he would work through the problems in office hours if asked. :: Very well. He is very busy, but he made time to meet and to respond to emails quickly. :: very effectively. :: He was a good at communicating. :: Gave examples of topics and answered emails within 24 hours. :: If someone speaks with him he puts out his cellphone and check his emails in the meanwhile. Very disrespectful. :: Great. :: It usually would take large amount of time to reply to emails but often very vague in replies. Also he always had office hours but it seemed whenever I would bring a problem I need help on I'd leave more confused or with no answer at all. :: almost too much so. :: If you had a question whether in class or out of class he would answer them as quickly as possible. :: well"
1175,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: eh. :: Not particularly, because whether or not we were given a lecture was based on how he felt. :: The lectures could've been more effective as stated above. :: Yes. :: Mostly. Some lectures were better than other though it's hard to pin point what exactly happened to make them so. Useless comment is fairly uselses. :: Not at all. :: kind of. :: No. :: yes. :: Not well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Lots of examples, more centered on student involvement and not extremely clear (maybe due to the complicated material). :: NO. he is all over the place. very hard to follow especially since I am there 99% of the time. The other 1% is military obligation. :: Generally yes, although I wish we had spent some more time on Laplace transforms back at the beginning of the semester. The topics we covered later in the semester almost always built on previous ones, which did a good job working all of the class content into a cohesive whole. :: I like doing problems in class, but this instructor didn't walk through the problem after giving us time, or give us the final answer to compare ours to. :: No. In some weeks, he gave a lot of homework, and it was very difficult for me since he did not provide much help (tutoring or recitation). Additionally, he needs to return homework to students before each quiz because students cannot study for the quiz without homework solution. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: They were fairly organized. :: Yes. Never went too far off schedule compared to most other classes. :: Yes, although some of the quizzes were a little off based on what had previously been covered. :: Yes. :: No to the best of the instructors abilities. :: Yes. :: He is the only professor at Wright State who doesn't update/state the homework problems in time. It is a joke that he updates the homework problems within 48 hours before due date. This happend throughout the semester and he encouraged students to start ""early"" with the homework problems. Several students did wrong homework problems and struggled to do the homework and to finish it in time. To answer the question of a student ""how should we prepare for the quizzes"", he said ""that we have to nail the homework"". How should we nail the homework when the homework gets updated/stated at the very last second. It is hard to learn the material because the homework problems get updated that late. This problem can be changed very easily. Very unprofessional his organizational behavior. :: yes. :: No, he would often come in and tell us that he didn't feel like writing today. Felt also that more time was spent telling us stories that were not productive or meant to impress us. :: yes. :: I believe so. :: yes"
1176,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: very. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Reasonably available? Yes. Responsive? Mostly. Sometimes quiz meetings got off topic from the quiz to some interesting separate topics. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Somewhat. :: I liked the fact that he was quick for online consultation. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never tried, but he seemed to be responsive. I don't know. :: Yes, he scheduled appointments through Office 365 online with no problems and had available office hours frequently. :: I have went several times to office hours. It was helpful 50% of the time. Hit and miss. The problem is that, when i do go to office hours, he isn't there 80% of the time which make me have to wait on him. Once he gets to the room, he puts me on hold till he finishes what he is doing and we talk about nothing and everything. NOTHING about the class and EVERYTHING about things I dont need for the class. :: Yes, though occasionally it took a few days to get a response to email queries. :: Yes, very. :: Yes. :: yes, within 24 hours. :: yes. :: This is a strong suit of the professor. :: Very available. :: In terms of office hours and email, he was the best professor I have ever had. :: Yes, offices hours were decided upon to ensure the maximum amount of availability for the students to attend. He was very responsive to meeting outside of class or communicating via email. :: He was more available in his office than via email. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always, yes. :: yes. :: if I had kept normal hours then yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
1177,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- everything was very well done. :: HE IS TO COMPLICATED. :: if i get this many fucking notifications again to do one of these stupid surveys I will never do another one. fucking christ wright state. :: I feel like I have walked away from this class with practically no knowledge. Like a 9 week course that was a refresher or old material would be more valuable. :: Solutions to the homework assignments would help with learning tremendously. Please consider this. :: no. :: Yet another person who has no business in the classroom. We pay thousands of dollars to waste an entire semester listening to this guy attempt to teach us. It's incredible annoying because this seemed like a class that will be important in my career as an engineer. :: No. :: No. :: No. :: Slater is an awesome guy, but this class is so much more complex than anyone anticipates and requires a lot of explanation and attention. :: Get a new professor for System Dynamics .  I wish I can go to class and say I learned something. I want to be able to say that he one who is teaching me is passionate about what they are doing and can influence the students. I want to learn this material but Dr. Slater fails at teaching properly. :: I learned a lot in class, and absolutely love his enthusiasm and honesty about engineering. I feel he truly wants to train us to think like engineers, and become good ones once we graduate. :: No. :: Would take class with him again, and recommend to a friend. :: no. :: no. :: This course requires some type of feedback on how to do the material. We would lose points on our homework, but never see the correct solution. All I learned in this course was I am doing things incorrectly, and never actually learned the correct way of doing things. Yes the book helps a little, but when he tells us to do it a different way than the book, then we do it wrong and never see the correct answer how are we supposed to learn? This course needs more feedback, a better defined grading system, a place we can go and view our grades, and a better set of lecture notes. :: Yes. :: In general, a good professor if we don't look at his organizational skills. :: no, great experience!. :: This class was by far the worst class I have experienced during my college experience. I felt as though Dr. Slater made this class much more difficult then it should be with lack of examples, explanation, and homework with material not taught. Also there was a large portion of the class that relied on using Matlab and functions he did not teach and that we were  expected to use on quizzes in class. I left class almost everyday feeling demoralized and talked down to and not as though I had made any progress in the my knowledge of the subject. :: I just wish I could have had a better learning experience in this class. I didn't learn from a scheduled pop quiz. I believe exams throughout the semester gives the students a better understanding on the material they need to learn and pick up on any material their slacking on. One exam for the entire semester, is a bit extreme and stressful. I feel like this course is easier than what was taught, I just never understood where I stand in the class. I believe having grades posted, or solutions to homework and quiz readily available for students to view there mistakes would have helped a lot. :: Nope"
1178,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- OK. :: The professor was very knowledgeable on the subject material. If material was not clear in class, Dr. Slater was very good about explaining material during his office hours. After visiting him during office hours I always felt that I had a much better grasp of the material. :: Professor was very effective.  Going into the class the knowledge was not all there and he was able to help in any way to get us to the level we needed to be at. :: Dr. Slater is very bright, but the complexity and volume of the material in this course may have been better suited for two separate semesters. It would have been very nice to have a lot more in class or even in book examples that could have aided in the understanding of the material."
1179,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I do not recall any syllabus. No Pilot, either. :: All of the material described in the syllabus was covered in the course. The only material that was not clearly outlined in the syllabus was the expectations for labs. :: Yes he did. :: The instructor was very fair in his expectations and the evaluations of the students."
1180,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Class was always started on time and always lasted the entire period. :: Yes.  He always started on time and he would tend to go over to make sure he covered everything he needed to and to make sure he answered all our questions. :: Yes.
1181,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Willingness to answer questions. In-depth knowledge of the subject. :: Dr. Slater was very willing to meet outside of class and outside of his regularly scheduled office hours. He was very flexible with meeting times and encouraged all of us to meet with him. :: The instructor was very interested in making sure the students were able to learn and understood all the content.  If there were any questions he always made sure to answer until the students understood.  He was also was always available for office hours if students had additional questions. :: He encouraged us to come to his office hours, and in class he took time to make sure everyone's questions were answered."
1182,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Slater was very good at emailing us when necessary or informing us when we should schedule office hours with him. :: Instructor was great in office hours.  In class there could have been more examples, but he was very open to hearing those comments from the students throughout the semester to be able to change that for the future. :: In the classroom, Dr. Slater was very difficult to follow because of the many in-depth derivations that were performed and the fact that the notation that was used in the book was very difficult to follow from chapter to chapter. I had a very tough time following the flow of everything and seeing the big picture because we rarely saw it applied to an actual vibration testing problem."
1183,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not really. More waving of hands and writing on the board would have been nice. Reading from his unfinished manuscript was difficult to concentrate on. It was nice that the manuscript was provided free of charge. :: The content flowed very smoothly. More examples in or out of class would be beneficial. Supplementary material on the Vibration Testing toolbox would be helpful as well in order to learn how to properly use it. :: Yes they were.  It was a little rough with the book, but that is because it is still being worked on.  It will be a lot better once he has more examples in there. :: Everything was well organized. It could have been slowed down a little bit, though."
1184,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Dr. Slater was always on time with office hours. When requesting a meeting he always responded promptly. :: Yes he was always available when needed. :: The professor was available to help with questions outside of class."
1185,Joseph Slater,2016 Spring,ME 7690,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The class was not very structured. We had one homework assignment, two tests, and five lab reports. As of 4-15-16, we never received any feedback from them. :: Overall I have learned more in this course from this professor than in a lot of other courses. :: The lab portion of the class was very poorly organized, and the equipment necessary for the required labs was very poorly maintained. It would also be nice to have a more polished edition of the manuscript for reference outside of class."
1186,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- meh. :: good. :: Dr. mian is a very smart individual, but he is not very good at explaining the step by step process into what he is doing for us. He is however good at explaining the theory. Please work on more examples and not making them so complicated. :: Teaching was effective but a little erratic at times. :: Great. :: Dr. Mian was good at explaining the key content of this course. :: He was an okay instructor.  Was hard to stay engaged in the lectures, as they jumped all over the place. :: average. :: Somewhat effective, he seemed to crawl during the first couple weeks of class and then went really fast to try and catch himself up. We didn't get through everything we needed to get through and I can't say I know everything I need to know to move on. What he taught us in the beginning of the semester stuck well I think because he wasn't rushing to get through stuff. Towards the end we were going much faster and I got lost somewhere along the way. :: He is very effective.  He describes the material in detail and walks us through examples. :: Best instructor in wright state. :: Class time was well spent. Worked over example problems to teach the material. It worked. :: somewhat effective. :: Dr. Mian was incredibly ineffective.  I understand that he was brought on to integrate additive manufacturing into the Wright State Engineering program, but having him as a professor does this school a great disservice.  His inability to effectively pass on information was mostly due to disorganization and what I assume is a lack of comfort with the material itself.  He consistently could not solve or finish a single problem within a class period, and that was partly due to the fact that he was obviously unprepared for the course.  Had he actually worked out the problems before class and had them written down, he might have been able to act like he knew how to solve the problems.  And maybe he does know how, and he was just nervous in front of students, but either way he needs to come to class prepared so that he isn't constantly making mistakes and constantly taking too long on the problems.  It is very difficult to learn from someone when they make so many mistakes because I have to constantly train myself to forget the wrong thing that he just told me, and I learn not to trust him.  I ultimately didn't learn much more from this class than I did in Statics and Structures and Properties of Materials.  I will almost definitely be disadvantaged in my future courses, and possibly future career, because of how poorly Dr. Mian presented this information. :: He may know his material, but he could use some more practice or structure when teaching it. It felt like we went over topics very slow occasionally and we worked on problems in class that wouldnt be practical to have on an exam due to them being too lengthy. :: perfect. :: very good. :: Very good. :: I feel like he really didn't teach well at all. He would cover examples in class but rarely did he work the problems out ahead of time and then he would end up getting lost half way through the problem and tell the class to take a minute break. Also, there was one class session when students asked him to work out to problems from the previous homework assignment and he couldn't complete either question during class time. :: Goodg. :: effective. :: good. :: good teaching. :: very effective. :: Cool dude, kinda looks like a brown danny devito and I love it. :: He is great. :: I learned quite well from him. I liked his teaching method, which was to explain through examples and explain theory as we were working examples. :: Very effective. :: no. :: Was pretty clear and teaching the material but at times he seemed lost in his own problems and couldn't figure out the answer. :: Good. :: good instructor. :: I thought that Dr Mian was a very helpful and effective instructor.  He worked through many different problems with the class and explained them as we went along. :: He is very fair instructor. :: Not very effective. All over the place with his examples. He is a nice guy but I had to do almost all of my learning outside of class. And I'm worried how it will effect my higher level classes. :: Very unorganized and seemed to always be manic. :: Very effective. :: Great at explaining things. :: Spent a lot of time on single subjects but rushed through the harder stuff. It got way harder in the last month or so of the semester."
1187,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the exams were according to what we had in class. :: I thought his evaluations were very fair considering the material being taught. Also, knowing the course grading layout in the syllabus allows one to keep good track of course progress. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Instructor gave zeros on pilot on more than one of my assignments but when I got the graded paper back it was not a zero? i contacted him via email and he never responded or fixed the grades. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He said he was going to give 10 quizzes, 5 online and 5 in-class and he would always forget to post the quiz or even bring a quiz to class. :: Yes. :: Good. :: yes. :: good. :: yes he did. :: yes. :: yes he did, he is good in evaluating his students. :: Yes. :: Yes, his timing was off and the class was off to a slow start but he caught up gradually. The syllabus was actuate. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the work was evaluated based on the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He is a very lenient grader. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Homework was graded really harshly. Other than that it was fine."
1188,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes, however he kept us over a few times. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was always there and started class on time. Class time was well spent. :: Yes, class started on time everyday. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes for the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Class time was well spent. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes , the class is really worth. :: Good. :: yes. :: good. :: yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Normally on time, or within a few minutes and routinely pushed class to the last possible second. :: Very prompt. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The class started on time and used the entire period every time, including going over a few times. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Always, hardly ever took attendance though."
1189,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: He applied it to engineering. :: The instructor taught with lots of examples. Some theory was present, more would be appreciated. :: asking questions, giving class time to think about exercises. :: I think Dr. Mian is a good instructor. That being said, he didn't seem to peak my interest in learning the subject. There were no significant interesting points which could have made the learning process more fun. :: He would ask often if we understood. :: yes. :: He was very enthusiastic and interesting. He usually made sure we all knew what was going on. I could tell he wanted us to learn the stuff, not just pass the class. Having said that my statement for question 1 still stands. He rushed towards the end and sacrifices had to be made in the interest of time. :: He answered questions about homework problems, even if they weren't due yet. :: He always keeps the class interesting. :: By asking us what we thought about the homework. :: yes. :: Dr. Mian is a very nice person, and I feel that he actually desires for his students to learn, but he is incapable of helping us do it. :: yes. :: great. :: very well. :: Good. :: Yes. :: Good. :: nicely. :: good. :: yes. :: x. :: In a Danny Devito way, like when he played the penguin on batman. :: It was good. :: Made sure any and all questions were answered and gave 30 second breaks to allow us to more closely examine the problem to see if we understood it. :: Passionate about his subject. :: By explaining problems and where these problems are used in life. :: good. :: The instructor would ask several times per class if we were understanding everything and make sure we were following along with what he was doing. :: He gives a Good examples. :: Answered questions often and asked if anyone had questions often. :: Yes. :: Always answered questions. Never evasive. Patient. :: Went over stuff again if some people were unsure about things. :: Never related it to anything real world."
1190,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: he could have been better. :: Communication was good in and out of the classroom. :: Very Effective. :: Dr. Mian always contected us about Homework Postings on Pilot and was very good at communicating both in and out of the classroom. :: He communicated well. :: well. :: Very well. :: Very well. :: I always contacted him via email and he always responds fast. :: Bad communication, did not respond to emails. :: poorly. :: Very ineffectively.  I very rarely knew what he was trying to say and he consistently contradicted himself.  Questions were not helpful as he does not know the material well enough to explain anything on topic. :: yes he did. I liked how he sent out emails when quizzes/ homework were posted. :: excellent. :: good. :: Good. :: He would always send out emails when we had homework or exams. He had good communication. :: Good. :: good. :: good. :: give an example for engineering to understand. :: easy to communicate with. :: He did good. :: Everything was communicated effectively. Emails were sent out when assignments and quizzes were posted to Pilot to remind us of them. :: Very effectively. :: Very well. :: good. :: Very effectively, including many emails to keep the class informed regarding homework and exams. :: Not very well inside the classroom. Also it is hard to reach him through email. :: Sometimes seemed confused and class often had to correct or helo him because he was unprepared. :: Very Well. :: Good. :: Very effectively."
1191,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: yes. :: We got behind early in the semester and he struggled to catch up, so we were rushed for the last half of the semester. :: Scheduled quizzes were sometimes erratic. Lecture content was well organized and proceeded numerically but more review would be appreciated at chapter ends and more relations from chapter to chapter would help solidify learning. :: Yes. :: Yes, the content in this course was organized in the most effective way. :: No.  He would start a problem and then not finish it.  Would stop in the middle of a problem to take attendance or pass back test.  Overall I don't think he was well organized. :: not at all. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, they were. :: As organized as they needed to be. :: kind of. :: Very disorganized.  I feel at some point, if he is willing to put effort into the class, he can at least reach a point where he seems like he knows the material purely because he will be copying his notes. :: yes except for the first month of clas. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: There was one week where we covered a single problem over the course of three different lectures and that's all we finished. It was not a very difficult problem either, he was just extremely slow and didn't work anything out ahead of time. :: Yes. :: Goood. :: yes. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part. The course started off slow and never really picked up pace. Some example problems in class didn't appear to be worked out before hand which caught him by surprise and took longer than he thought. For the most part everything was covered. :: Very organized. :: Yes. :: good. :: the course content and lectures were well organized for the most part.  I had no trouble with the organization. :: Yes. :: Did not seem to be. :: Seemed like they were haphazardly thrown together 15 minutes before class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not at all. The whole thing was kind of a mess to be honest."
1192,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I never needed. :: All though Dr. Mian rarely encouraged students to come to his office hours, I was aware of his office hours. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was. :: Never went to office hours, but not responsive online at all. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes , he always answer our questions and email quickly. :: Good. :: yes. :: good. :: yes in class and online, he is a reasonable person. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, with office hours three times a week and email access. :: Yes he was. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not sure. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I would say so."
1193,Akm Mian,2016 Spring,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Dr. Mian often seemed distracted in class. This may not be his fault but often students are only as interested in the subject as the teacher is. :: great professor, very attentious. :: No. :: No. :: you would ask him about something and he would tell you he would get back to you..yeah never happened. :: Very good teacher when he is taking his time. I really liked him and would absolutely take him again. :: Best instructor in wight state. I would definitely take a class with him in the future. :: Wright State's Engineering program has no hope of ever advancing or becoming more respected as long as the department is making poor ""big picture"" choices, such as trying to integrate additive manufacturing by what I assume was offering tenure to an incompetent professor.  Now we will have an additive manufacturing program that helps a few students pigeon-hole themselves into a very narrow and basically worthless program, as any engineer will be able to work in the additive manufacturing sector without a specific additive manufacturing degree, and we will also have the added disadvantage of hundreds of students who will be improperly prepared for the work force due to a professor that contractually cannot be fired.  This sort of myopia will surely tarnish any reputation that an engineering degree from Wright State will have in the future. :: I feel like if you have an exam average over 95% leading up to the final you shouldnt have to take it, Or figure out a way to still take a test on the material, but not have it effect your grade. :: no. :: no. :: Thank you. :: I feel like I am going to retain borderline nothing from this class because he did such a poor job. I am most likely going to get an A in the class, but I am terrified for future courses where this is a pre-req because I am going to have next to no idea what is going on. The instructor is a very nice guy, but I feel like he doesn't know the material well and probably shouldn't be teaching this class. :: What a good professor. :: Good. :: good. :: no. :: no. :: No thnx. :: I liked the class and liked the professor. Just needed to adjust how much time was allotted per subject and work example before so any surprises weren't discovered in class. Learned a lot in class. :: No. :: No. :: no. :: Nice guy. Just needs to get better at going through examples in class. He is all over the place while doing his math.  I, personally, feel like I would have benefited more from receiving an equation list as well. Myself and others noted that we were never really given a group of base equations to use. Granted I'm sure we got them all at some point in the semester just spread out over time. But I think that would've helped with everyone's understanding. :: I feel that I didnt learn enough in this course to justify the cost. I wish I had known about the teacher before hand and took it with a more competent teacher. :: Dr. Mian was great. :: I wish we had spent the 3 weeks on statics at the begining of the semester on the actual course content."

He did his best to tech us the roots of the subject, but 1% i felt that there is a little difficulty to explain the concept. But overall i got knowledge more than i deserve. :: Dr. Mian was mostly effective. I feel like I have gained a great understanding of the additive manufacturing processes and it's place in industry at the moment as well as the potential that lies with it. I do not feel like I grasp most of the chemical aspects of it, being that I am not a materials major and have only taken a couple of materials classes I am not well versed in the field. :: He was Ok. :: Dr. Mian was fine.  He could be hard to understand from time to time.  He did have some moments were it seemed that it might have been the first time he was looking over certain material and needed a second to solve it out himself before finishing a problem or derivation.  But overall Dr. Mian was a fine professor. :: - Explanation was clear and fluent. - Was helpful in clear doubts. :: Overall the teaching of Dr. Ahsan Mian was excellent.

1224,Scott Thomas,2016 Spring,ME 3360,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: He would help through a problem during office hours and if he was emailed at different points in the day, he would respond as soon as he was able to. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes!. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The couple times I emailed Scott, I got an answer fairly quickly. :: Yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Very available. :: yes. :: Never tried.. :: YES. :: Yes. :: i did not contact him outside of class, but he seemed to be responsive to others contacting them when they did. :: Always, I was hardly at office hours because he explained it already great in class. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1225,Scott Thomas,2016 Spring,ME 3360,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- None here. Still one of my favorite professors ever at Wright State University. :: nope. :: no. :: no. :: Very good professor. :: Great instructor, I struggled with the material but have learned a great deal. I like his approach to solving problems and his willingness to provide lots and lots of examples to practice and solutions to check your work. Some professors will not give solutions after homework has been turned in and therefore it is hard to judge your progress in the class. I always learn the material when Dr. Thomas is the professor, it is not easy but well worth the hard work. :: had him for Matlab class and i he did not meet my expectations at all. I was very scared to take heat transfer with him but that is definitely the subject he should be teaching. Great at teaching heat transfer. :: No. :: It was my second course with scott thomas, again I`m satisfied, amazing professor, in my opinion fair test, a lot of exercises and all the solutions posted so we can study at home, the only problem at this semester is that we missed one class due to some problem mr.scott had, so had to hurry at chapter 12 and we didnt had examples in class (and professor scott is amazing when he does examples), but I`m really thankfull for all I learned at this course. :: Before coming into this class, I had a few classmates tell me that Scott assigns a lot of work, that the tests are hard, but that I'll have a good grasp on the material by the time the course is over.  I feel like this is a very accurate description of the class.  Given the chance to take a class with Scott again, I would absolutely do so. :: You seemed to tone it down a bit with the tests, that was nice. Its pretty frustrating to have your knowledge in a subject based off of one professors idea of a test. Especially when he goes out of his way to make them more difficult that they need to be, so that they end up not ever adequately evaluating your knowledge of the subject. :: NO. :: No. :: No. :: Thanks so much for organizing your website like you do, its so nice!. :: no. :: No. :: the best teacher if you really want to learn something. :: I was disappointed that we didn't get to use the Caladoxyogymooger like we did in Statics. I learned that Dennis is Scott's archnemhisis, which I would have to say, I would pick a Scott Thomas class over a Dennis class any day. :: NOPE. :: Great professer! Probably the best teacher I have ever had despite Heat Transfer is in general not my favorite class but he could make it much more interesting for me. :: One of the best if not the best professors I have had in my journey here at Wright State."
1226,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Start of the semester was a little tough, but he was in a new environment teaching a new style. By a little over half way through the semester he got the hang of things and was an effective instructor, although it would have been nice he he lectured more and gave pre questions to do before lecture. :: The instructor was knowledgeable and was helpful when it was needed but I feel the scale-up style of the class kind of took away from the instructor ability to throughly teach the subject. :: He is a very good instructor. He helped as a lot inside the class and out side the class. :: Great. :: Overall the instructor was very knowledgeable about the course material. :: The instructor was not relevant in the course until three quarters of the semester was already over. When he was effective he is engaging and knows the material. :: He was really effective during lectures. He would often lecture, then have us practice the concept in class and then repeat. I felt like this helped in my learning. :: he was okay but with the new way of teaching could be better. :: Average. :: He wasn't very effective. I didn't learn very much. You didn't need to actually learn the material in order to get a good grade. Perusall is what I'm referring to specifically. It didn't require you to actually know the subject. :: Difficult to learn from this instructor. :: Time was spent poorly at beginning as expected with this style of class but then he started doing lectures and exercises in class which made the course much more effective. :: 6/10. 10 being the best. I do not learn a lot from this type of class( a lot of round table class). I don't know because it is new or something, I don't feel like learning a lot when I go to class. :: I learned a lot from this instructor. :: he is a great teacher but I didn't learn anything from the scale up class setting, not his fault though. :: Did okay for the class style. :: The instructor was somewhat effective. His powerpoint slides were helpful. :: This course was very interesting and the methods of teaching that the teacher used was great and more effective than any course I have taken. :: great, very clear and covers every misunderstanding that students may have. :: Bad. :: Good. :: Instructor was pretty effective in the education process. :: Instructor is very effective. Very knowledgeable, provided many clear and applicable examples. :: The lectures from the Professor contributed greatly to my understanding of the course material. :: Knows material and is good when he lectures. Class setup does not help in learning the material. :: he is a good in structure. :: He knows what he is talking about. Being that this was his first time doing scale up, i believe he can fix a few things. :: The instructor was very knowledgeable of the material, but the way the class was set up, it was very difficult to learn the material.  I had to learn most of the material by myself which make coming to class pointless. :: he was okay. :: good. :: Dr. Srinivasan was very effective. His lectures were very clear and emphasized the more important information. He was open to non-standard teaching methods which in my experience were more effective in allowing the students to learn the material. Examples of this are how during lecture he highlighted areas from the assigned readings that students had questions about, and he reviewed the homework assignments as opposed to just grading and returning them. :: The instructor was fantastic. :: He is very smart but I struggled to understand certain concepts. :: yes"
1227,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes he did and because this was a new teaching style he was very clear on what he wanted from the class. :: Yes the work was evaluated based on expectations described. :: Yes. Also, he treated as better than i assumed. :: Yes. :: yes, there were very detailed expectations on how the work would be graded. :: The course did not fully follow the syllabus that was laid out in the beginning. The course relied on students engaging with each other in order to work out problems, but if the group does not cooperate then that eliminates the relevance of the course. The course was moving to slowly for the amount of information that was to be covered so some of the information was left out in order to cover the important concepts. :: yes, he stuck to the syllabus overall. Any deviation was to the students benefit. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: sort of. :: Yes seemed to follow it exactly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Good. :: Work was evaluate as described. :: Yes. :: The instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: yes. :: yes he did. :: Yes. However, the annotations were very difficult to remember and worth 25% of the final class grade which makes a huge impact when one or two are forgotten here and there. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. My only complaint is that the scoring for the reading assignments was accomplished via a computer program as opposed to a grader reading the annotations. Good annotations would be graded poorly because they did not contain keywords the program was looking for. This led to the reading assignments being more about writing annotations that the program would grade well as opposed to writing them to convey the student's understanding of the material. :: yes, he did his best to evaluate our work as described in the syllabus and tried not to deviate from it much. :: Yes he did. :: yes"
1228,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes he did, sometimes he went over the full class period, other times he ended early it just depended on what he was lecturing on that day. :: Yes class began and ended in the allotted time period. Yes class time was generally fully used. :: yes, he used all the class time. Also, he gave us a lot of time to work to gather as group. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The instructor was periodically fifteen minuets early in order t set up the class room when the students arrived. :: every day. :: yes. :: Sure. :: Sometimes. :: yes. :: Yes to both. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time and the full class period was always used. :: Yes. :: yes, indeed. :: Yes. :: Good. :: Full class period was used to the optimal amount. :: Yes. :: The class always started on time and the entire period was utilized. :: Always. :: yes he did. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. he was always on time and ended on schedule. :: Yes. :: yes"
1229,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He brought in models and explained things very clearly and used demonstrations. :: The instructor showed interest by asking each student what they may be having trouble understanding and was more than glad to assist them in improving that understanding. :: He let me to work with other students and he did teach me hoe to work in a group which is my first time experience for me. :: Yes. :: routine lectures broken up with class projects. :: He encouraged the groups to work together and asked questions when he was lecturing. :: By having us annotate the textbook outside of the class. :: yes. :: Not at all. :: Most of the class wasn't very interesting. :: He didn't really demonstrate any interest in my learning. :: He gave us a project at the end to apply some of the things we learned to an actual superhero weapon. :: a lot. :: by having a guest speaker come into class to describe his job and show us what the content looks like in the field. :: yes. :: trying to figure out what we didn't know. :: He explained things when people had questions or reviewed material that students didnt understand. :: The method of annotations was great it gave me the opportunity to read the book and demonstrate what I learned and make comments and answering others question. :: he did a good job on that. :: Not interested. :: Good. :: Instructor demonstrated learning through the use of real world scenarios. :: Always walked around to make sure we were focused on discussion of the material. Would answer most questions from Perusall. :: The professor would find questions from students from book annotations and explain them in class. :: very good. :: He walked around during class to make sure i understood what was going on which was very helpful. :: yes. :: i dont know. :: He actively communicated with the students in order to gain understanding of their level of comprehension of the material. :: he was very hands on with our learning and interested in making sure we achieved what we wanted to get from the course. :: Class discussion.
1230,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In the classroom he was very responsive, sometimes he was lacking on responding in an orderly manner with e-mail. But he would approach you in lecture to answer your questions given in an e-mail. :: communication was very good everything that was important or coming up if it was not announced in class an email was sent containing the information. :: He was very good in communicating with the syudent both in and out of the classroom. :: Yes. :: effectively. there were no problems communicating with the instructor. :: If questions were asked he would answer them, and he would answer emails quickly. :: Extremely well. He would email the class about anything he deemed important. He also emailed me back quickly if i emailed him about any concerns i had. :: was okay could of been better. :: Average. :: Decently well. I wish he posted the homeworks earlier than he did. :: allright. :: Good. :: 6/10 .10 being the best. I think you have to do some sort of penalty if student on their phone playing games or go on social media because they got distract from those electronic devices. :: really effective because he was always available when asked if you could meet. :: very well. :: fairly well. :: He communicated well inside and out of class. :: During office hour and by emails that he replies always. :: he is always available in office hours, email, by the end of each class and even he spend some time with student after class room in the hall ways to assist any concept covered in class. :: Good. :: Good. :: Inside the Classroom: Instructor was ready and available to answer any questions given. Outside the Classroom: Instructor would answer questions by mean of Perusall which when answered seemed to be useful. :: Very effectively. Always kept students up to date. :: The professor answered questions thoroughly during class and would provide answers to questions online. :: excellent. :: Very well, both in and out of the classroom. :: very well. :: good, responded to emails promptly. :: Very well. :: very well. :: He would email us about changes in the syllabus if need be."
1231,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes he explained what he wanted to when he wanted to, and kept up with the syllabus. :: Yes for the most part the schedule had to be changed and the lectured different from day to day on how they were presented. :: Yes they were. :: Yes. :: no, the structure of the class was impossible to follow, and there were very few in depth lectures, this inhibited my understanding of much of the material. :: when he would lecture the information would only cover the topics that were most confusing to the students in the class. If a single student was confused about a different topic the question would not be answered. So I'm certain that many questions would go unanswered. :: Yes, he uploaded all his notes and powerpoint slides to pilot so everyone can follow him during lecture. Then he would add annotations to his own powerpoint slides and reupload them,. :: yes. :: Not at all, part way through the semester, we did a complete change in how the class worked. :: Decently enough for a firs attempt at this style of teaching. :: no. :: Yes. :: somewhat. :: Yes for the most part. :: yes. :: yes. :: Everything was organized through perusall. :: Yes. :: yes in some places. :: No. :: Good. :: Lectures were well organized and followed the book fairly well. :: I didn't care for the way the course was layed out. It felt like we spent longer times on each topic and retained less info than a traditional lecture. I didn't care for Perusall as I found it buggier, clunkier, and just an overall worse experience than a standard paper textbook. I don't think this was the fault of the instructor and instead is more to do with the Scale Up layout. The instructor did keep all the content on Pilot very well organized and easily accessible. :: The course content was well organized and all lectures were provided online. :: I think this course needs to be more lecture and less project based/ hands on to effectively learn the material. :: yes. :: Not so much. I think it is because this was his first scale up class. I think now he has a better idea of how to run the class and organize the material to mesh better with the different learning environment. :: semi. :: yes. :: no in the beginning, yes towards the end. :: Yes. :: yes they were. :: He lectured or we did group work."
1232,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes he was available when needed. :: Yes the instructor was available the couple time i needed any extra help. :: Yes he was available during these times. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I never contacted him outside of class. :: yes. Responded to emails quickly and emailed the class frequently. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: never went to an appointment. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I havent tried. :: Good. :: Yes. :: The instructor was always available and responsive to student needs during office hours, appointments and online. :: yes. :: Yes, he was very responsive. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: he was always available when ever i needed to contact him. :: Yes."
1233,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is a wonderful professor and an intelligent man. :: I think the instructor was very good on the basis of knowledge and ability to present the knowledge but with this being the first time he had taught the course in this scale-up style i think it hindered some of his abilities. I have some mixed feeling about the way the class was handled i liked the way you was required to read the information on your own and the way everything was graded was fine, but i like the traditional way lecture goes better than just discussing what we read during class or working through problems. :: No. :: This new way of teaching structures in properties was a unique experience, however it was very difficult to learn in the environment, if i wanted to annotate a book i would have done an independent study.. :: The instructor is knowledgeable about the information he was teaching. But the way the class was laid out was rather detrimental to his ability to teach because not every student was on the same page in the class and he had to assume when he was teaching the material he had to assume that every student was on the same page. The concept in the class was a good premise but was not executed well because we were placed in groups but the group portion of the class was very small except for a single project and some quiz's. Overall I learned in the class but I have not learned everything that was supposed to be learned in this course. :: Amazing professor, Love the teaching style. :: perusall did not help me learn in any way i did not like being forced to have a digital copy of the book  i'm a person that like to have the book makes much easier to find stuff and flip between pages. the grading on perusall is not right i should be able to see what i'm doing right or what i'm doing wrong.  never use perusall again this is an engineering class and not some English class!!!!. :: Terrible class. :: This style of teaching is ridiculous. This learn it yourself and come into class to review concept doesn't work for me in any way. It didn't help that Perusall didn't really require us to know what we're reading. This upscale teaching method, or whatever you actually call it, really just means teach yourself. If I wanted to teach it to myself I would've just bought the book and not bothered paying someone to not teach me. Instead I payed for someone to tell me to teach myself and grade me on whether or not I succeeded. Seems very backwards and not effective. This is the second upscale class I've taken and I refuse to take another one. Both of which ended up with me teaching myself. Absolute waste of time. Having said all that I liked my professor this go around. He was very knowledgeable and organized. With this being his first crack at the upscale teaching I think he did a great job, but again I don't like this method. It's nothing against him, it's just that this way of teaching doesn't work. :: no. :: No. :: Weird class setup but taught in an effective way. :: no. :: difficult class style because i was taught to learn my whole life differently. :: This class does  not need to flipped. I did not learn very much at all  from this style. Half the grade is from homework that no one knows how to do and annotations that are easy to manipulate. This class could be okay flipped if the instructor could use the technology better. He struggled for weeks with clickers and attendance. The class isnt terrible but needs lots of improvements. :: I hope many professors use his method because cor me it is effective. :: No. :: Good. :: Overall professor Srinivasan did an excellent job with the course, however I feel it would be more beneficial to do a few more lectures at the beginning of the year. :: I don't think that Scale Up is an effective tool for teaching engineering courses. I feel that the instructor and the class would've been more effective if it was in a traditional lecture format. All Scale Up really did was create unnecessary outside of class work that really didn't help me in my understanding of the course. Despite Scale Up being advertised as not being death by homework, I had more take home work in this class than any other engineering class that I've taken. I'd rather have exams as they do a better job of letting me know what I understand and what I need to improve on. In all I think Scale Up should be kept to gen eds and majors where it might be found more helpful, but not engineering. :: None. :: no, everything is good. :: He is a good professor, most likely going to get a bad reputation because of the inorganized set up. :: I do not like how this class was structured; Dr. Srini tried a new teaching style for this class, and i do not think that S&P was a good choice of that. I think this class is a bit too difficult for students to be expected to learn all the material and get used to a new teaching style where basically we had to teach ourselves and if there were questions that we COULD NOT answer, then we could ask him or one of the TA's. If this class were instead, intro to reading books or something easy like that, then I think this structure would be OK to try. Not in S&P. Thanks. :: no"
1234,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- bad. :: Very effective.  Helped us a lot. :: The dual instructor aspect was less than fluent. Led to a very unorganized class and undefined requirements. :: q. :: The lecture he did do was alright. :: Bland. :: not too good. :: Very unorganized. I had to constantly remind or bug him to put up the rubric and template for our final report. It was finally put on Pilot about a week and a half before it was due and it was supposed to be an 80 page report. :: Very effective. :: not good. :: not bad. need more work. :: good. :: Somehow effective!. :: YES. :: good. :: very good. :: good
1235,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- no. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: q. :: Yes. :: No, he treated the class too seriously yet did not stay up with the requirements. Poor organization. :: yes. :: Yes, everything was outlined in the syllabus,. :: Yes, was very fair. :: not good. :: no. :: yes. :: Average! but he must not judge people based on their origin or must not treat students differently on any base. An example of that is saying ""I'm disappointment of your work, although we had more than a month to finish our tasks"". :: YES. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes"
1236,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- no. :: yes. :: Sure. :: q. :: Yes, maybe a bit later sometimes. :: Yes and no. :: yes. :: Yes. However, coming to the Capstone class solely for guest speakers was a waste of time. The class should be used for our projects. :: Yes. :: not good. :: no. :: yes. :: He was late couple classes in which one of them he showed up around 15 minutes after it began. :: YES. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes"
1237,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- so bad. :: He taught me more about senior design and how the real world will be like. :: q. :: Showed his interst in everyone's projects. :: .. :: no. :: He met with us every other week about our project. :: He gave us helpful feedback to help us improve. :: not good. :: bad. :: none. :: Not that much!

Again, unorganized. :: q. :: A bit last minute in everything. Important information was only made avalible weeks to days before. Would have preferred day one. :: Well. :: good. :: Expectations for our presentation and our report changed a lot between what was said in class versus what was eventually sent out in an email or put on Pilot. :: Very well, no issues. :: not good. :: not bad. :: good. :: He was communicating fine in-class due to the fact that we ask him in person He is one of the most, if not the only, professors who never respond to their email. I never got a response from him to my emails! and that includes other classes that I took with him previously!. :: YES. :: good. :: available. :: good"

Taper this back. :: q. :: No. :: no but don't let him teach the class. :: Overall, I think the class should be used more for the actual Capstone project and less for guest speakers. It is very unorganized sometimes and can really get frustrating when you ask the professor a question that he cannot answer and then takes 2+ weeks to get back to you with an answer. Trying to be proactive and get things done early for this class is almost impossible because they wait until the last minute to tell you what you need. :: not good. :: no. :: yes. :: Again, I literally hated taking this class with him because I strongly felt that there are many other aspects that I had to deal with other than the academic ones!. :: YES. :: no. :: He is very smart. :: no"

He provided us with many helpful points. :: He was interested. :: Team meetings were very helpful throughout both semesters. :: Yes. :: By having many guest speakers come in to speak about different aspects of fields that we are not exposed to on a daily basis. :: He is teaching and explaining everything things. :: By providing examples of previous work and his own experience. :: the content was effectively communicated. :: By continuously assisting our team in critical thinking and challenging our methods to determine if we were following the correct path. :: Bi-monthly personal meetings. :: Dr. Roberts held regular bi-weekly meetings with each senior design team to keep updated on their project progress and also to get feedback on how the class was going. :: Honestly there was nothing to demonstrate , there shouldn't be class time for capstone, the student is expected to meet with 1) group  2) advisor  3) instructor 4) class  on top of that the individual work we put in to finish the project, thus the class was just extra hour and 50 min of doing nothing but to listen to a boring lecture. :: He always asks us if we have any questions, concerns, or comments. He tries to supply us with useful material and information"
1254,Rory Roberts,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: we;;. :: very effective. :: Very well. :: I never had any problems communicating with Dr. Roberts. :: Good. :: Good, except assignments were not often communicated very well as I said before. :: Very well. :: He was usually easy to contact but miscommunication was not uncommon. :: He did a great job and always he available for any questions. :: Very effectively. :: Very well. :: Well. :: Well. :: Dr. Roberts is very easy to approach and answers questions quickly and clearly both in and out of the classroom. :: -----. :: He responds to emails within a reasonable time"
1255,Rory Roberts,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: mostly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, I believe this class was organized well and I had no problems following along. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Alright felt disorganized some days. :: They were fairly well organized but could be laid out in a different manner so as to align with the individual senior design projects time-line's. :: Yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes and no. :: Mostly"
1256,Rory Roberts,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, I never had any issues communicating with Dr. Roberts. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he always available. :: YES always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Roberts was available online any time we needed him. I have no experience with trying to contact him during office hours or by appointment. :: yes. :: Yes"
1257,Rory Roberts,2016 Spring,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: nope. :: lectures and classes were pretty pointless. The time used in class could have been time spent on working on our project. Not having such a stick attendance policy should be applied to later classes. :: Maybe doing a shadow day for students to observe industy. :: Overall, I was very pleased with the way Dr. Roberts ran the senior design class throughout the year. :: No. :: Very good overall, more direction on the assignments and reports would be beneficial. :: Dont feel the lecture portion of this class is necessary. I could have skipped it everyday and still gotten an A in the class. :: Thanks. :: no. :: No. :: I have always enjoyed having Dr. Roberts as an instructor. However, my project leader is Dr. Lieh. He has been meaningless in terms of helping students. :: no. :: The notebook system for this class needs reworked. A standard set of requirements for each notebook entry should be set. Also, unrelated to Dr. Roberts, the TA graded them on a seemingly arbitrary scale, often taking off points and leaving comments directly contradicting what is written by the students. :: nope. :: No"
1258,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective, and was very nice all the time. :: Very Effective. :: Dr. Baudendistel did a fantastic job. He was clear with instructions and was very helpful every step of the way. :: Very understanding and helpful. :: great. :: You are one of the best professors at WSU. :: He was great!. :: Very effective and gets to the point to let yyou know what is needed too be done and always packed the day with a ton of information. :: The instructor shows knowledge of the subject and is willing to learn more and transfer that to the students.. overall effective 10/10. :: Reasonable. :: He is a great professor he does a step by step process of how to do things I know more about solid works than I ever could of imagined and I feel like if someone need me to make a part for them I could make it with little to zero problem. :: After taking his class I feel more comfortable using solidworks and I have a much better understanding of how to use it. :: Helpful and good. :: The instructor did a good job going through examples of topics. :: very good. :: He was very topic based, and was overall a great teacher. He made sure everybody was on task, and doing their work for the day whether that was doing that day's assignments or working on projects. :: Very good at explaining new skills and helping us to adapt to old ones in good ways. :: great enthusiasm with students very descriptive  and brings a lot of energy to class. Best instructor I've had thus far. :: He was very helpful, although sometimes fast, he always gave time for those who didn't understand to catch up. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and explains it well with examples. :: He was a good instructor, he explained things well. Maybe at times a little to fast, but would help you get back where you needed to be. :: good. :: Very effective, fantastic at conveying information. :: He was very thorough. He explained the techniques well and went over them multiple times to ensure the students' understanding, Some of the drawings we received as reference didn't always have needed dimensions, but we were able to figure them out. Overall, very effective at teaching Solidworks. :: Very. :: Very effective in teaching strategies and communication abilities."
1259,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes ! Very good !. :: Yes he stuck very true to the syllabus. :: to the letter. :: yes. :: yes everything that he said he grades he grades well and he will not only grade what you do but e will show you what you did wrong and how to fix it to make it right. He also always goes over the homework to see if you have any questions. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: He did exactly what was asked of us and we worked on exactly what was told to us. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Roughly, yes. :: yes, the syllabus was followed for the most part. :: yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was used as a reference for almost all assignments. :: Yes, our grading guidelines followed the syllabus as expected. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1260,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- He was late a couple times, but that was due to solidworks instruction he was doing to help us. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes !. :: Yes he always started class on time and would have the class the full length but would let the class have time to work on projects for the last half hour. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he always was here for class on time and started right on time, he also taught for almost the whole class and then gave us a little time to work on the homework for the week to see if we had any question. Yeah he made us stay the whole time if we wanted to get some points for the day. :: Yes. :: normally, occasionally class would start 10ish minutes (or between) behind. :: yes. :: yes. :: He did start class on time every class we had with him. He made sure he would have enough time to teach us what he needed to teach and then let us work on our work. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Mostly, someday the last hour was used to work on projects and get in class help on them which was very useful. :: yes. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time, never cancelled and class was used as lab when nothing new was being taught. :: Class always started on time, and usually ran for and hour and a half, with the remaining half hour to work on our assignments with the professor and TA's to answer any question we may have had. :: Yes. :: Majority of the time"
1261,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He remembered my chair design. :: He took classes to learn the program better to teach us better. :: He actively walked around and helped whenever needed. He also communicated quickly and effectively when approached via office hours or email. :: Helped as much as he could and took classes himself. :: yes. :: All the time. :: he would help out and change how he did things to help you out. :: was taking classes on the subject to expand his knowledge to pass on to the students. :: He would always wait for a couple of minutes after he showed every one something for everyone to try it and to see if they had any questions and then he would stop go over and help the student if they have a question. :: We went over how to do everything and he showed us examples on how to do things before he let us do it by ourselves.  He also went around the room helping whoever needed help. :: A lot of examples and answered many questions. :: Although it was a lot of work, he assigned a fun project that applied to the real world. :: very understanding and takes time to address every individual problem. :: He asked us what our majors are and what type of engineering we wanted to do, along with what was needed for each type and expressed interest in what we were doing project-wise and got us through our learning. :: He went to the length of going and taking advanced classes to further his own knowledge of CAD modeling in solidworks. :: very interested and asked for student input quite often. :: He wanted us to learn so we'd be able to accomplish the design tasks. :: yes. :: he helped everyone who was behind during class before moving on to the next topic. :: Yes, I felt that there was lots of information he wanted us to learn. both directly or indirectly. :: Yes, Dr. B was very quick at responding to our emails and always answered our questions thoroughly. :: In many ways. :: Yes"
1262,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: very well. :: He communicated very well. He was very active in class, walking around and engaging whenever needed. He was very approachable and enthusiastic whenever I reached out to him. :: Very well. :: yes. :: Very effectively. :: Very neatly. :: He communicated very well in the classroom and outside of the classroom. :: very responsive to questions in class and emails outside of class. :: well. :: He was really good about his email I sent him a couple emails over the semester and he responded to them almost instantly probably with in a day maybe 2 but his emails were always filled with help knowledge on how to fix my problem that I was having. :: Very well. :: good. :: good. :: amazing. :: He sent emails to those who needed any questions answered, and would stay the entire class period, even after if we had any questions on anything. He would also walk around the room to answer any questions given. :: He did a good job of helping us learn things in the classroom and speaking with us, along with that he did a good job of emailing us and updating us on things. :: good. :: Very well. :: Pretty well, if you needed help he would be more then happy to help. :: good. :: Yes, emails were constantly sent to us, students, informing us of what was to come and what would be changing. :: Dr. B was very good at posting updates to Pilot and letting us know of changes to class/assignments. :: Very. :: Very well and very prompt in emailing back"
1263,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: absolutely. :: Everything was very clear and organized. Every lecture was relevant to our current projects/assignments. :: Yes. :: yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes !! Showed us great examples than let us do our work . :: For the most part he went and learned more halfway through the course and taught us stuff which would have been better to learn earlier afterwards because of it. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, they were perfect he made us follow along with him in class Knew what to do and how to do I for homework which was really helpful because nobody had an insanely hard time doing the homework so no one needed a whole lot of help. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, I understood what was being taught. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes Pilot was easy to navigate and the course was set up nicely. :: The course was very well organized and the content was great. :: YEs. :: Yes"
1264,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I did not go t office hours. :: Always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes very good !. :: yes he had a lot of times that he would provide help to you if you needed any help. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he posted absolutely everything on pilot and gave a detailed description on what we needed to do and how to do everything so we would have minimal problem. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, like I said he sent emails to people and was responsive. :: Yes, he responded quickly to emails and was always available during office hours. :: yez. :: Yes. :: Yes, more office hours or at diffrent times would have been nice. :: yes. :: Yes Dr. Baudendistel was available at times of the day and night that surprised me. :: Yes, absolutely. :: Not at all, not nearly enough office hours for the massive amount of work he assigns. :: Yes"
1265,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Amazing teacher, hope to have for future courses. :: I would recommend this class under Dr. Baudendistel to anyone who has an interest in the material. Fantastic instructor!. :: Loads a lot of work on at a time. :: no. :: My only suggestion is to be less lenient on the students. As a student who always submits quality work on time and completely, it's irritating to see other students get leeway when they aren't careful about their work or submissions. You defined due dates and the required material very clearly and you shouldn't give out passes because students refuse to read thoroughly. Additionally, if they weren't sure what you wanted, they should contact you. Also, the practical portion of the first exam was way more work than could have reasonably been completed. I find it ridiculous and a little insulting that one of the UTA graders said they completed it in 40 minutes. Maybe make it more clear that you uploaded previous exam material for student to study. Thanks for a great semester!. :: Give him an award !. :: he was an amazing teacher and was a lot of fun to have. :: Just a really great professor and very easy to learn from and to understand all the topics he was teaching. :: No. :: Overall, he was a smart, neat, and nice guy who taught us relevant information for our majors. :: No. :: very professional enjoyed the class. :: none. :: no. :: Excellent Instructor, that I went out of my way to get for the Spring 2018 semester. :: Dr. B is an exceptional professor. He was very kind and understanding when many of the students were struggling to learn Solidworks at the start of the semester. Although he does not know everything about Solidworks, he took great lengths to learn more about the program to pass more techniques on to us. Overall, great professor, very involved, and I will definitely recommend him to anyone considering taking his class. :: He assigns ridiculous amounts of work, and students to do have the skills to complete it."
1266,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor is very effective at teaching this class. :: The material was taught well and was effectively taught. The class taught some really good applications for use within the field. :: He was good at explaining things, but the class time was very short and the lecture type discussions we had were done while everyone was standing and not many notes were able to be taken. Other than the limited class time, the instructor did a good job at answering and responding to questions, and was prompt about refilling supplies as they were depleted. :: Very effective and engaging when explaining lab methods and safety. :: Dr. Young is an excellent instructor, covering what needs to be done clearly and concisely, and explaining in depth why the students are taking the actions they need to take. :: He is a great teacher who understands what he is doing. His ability to explain engineering concepts is quite impressive. :: Very good. Explained what was necessary for the labs. :: Very good at teaching the material and providing good insight into the theory, (helped a lot with ME2700!!). :: He is a great professor and does a great job explaining what needs to be done. :: Very effective. :: no"
1267,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, although the class seems like it is the ""red headed stepchild"" of the materials path, and it has not been updated or changed much in a very long time so the labs are a little out-dated or different from what is asked of you. :: Well, currently there are no grades whatsoever for any of the work we have completed, so I'm not sure how well the work has been evaluated. :: Yes, the syllabus was accurate in explaining the expectations. :: yes, grading followed the syllabus. :: Unable to answer as of yet. We haven't received grades back yet, but I feel confident that he will do so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1268,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: For the most part. He gave us a lot of time in class to work on the labs in class, and anytime that he did use for class was for very good teachings on how to use the machines and or complete the labs. :: The class was started on time most of the time, and very rarely used the entire class time. :: no, but this was due to the lab nature of the class so it was still very effective; we could use extra class time for lab work. :: Class time was somewhat amorphous, due to being a rather free-form lab class on our own schedules. If he needed to cover topics with us, he would take the time in the scheduled time slot to speak with the class. Otherwise, the time was ours to work as we needed to in the lab. :: Yes. :: Not always. We often got time to work on our labs. Typical class time was about an hour. :: Yes. :: Yes, he made use of all the time. :: Yes"
1269,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes, he has a passion for materials science and metallography. :: The labs and class were very interesting! It made it very fun to complete and l enjoyed them. :: He made sure we knew what we were doing and answered all of our questions well. :: consistently asking if we had questions about labs, giving thorough explanations, was very available through email or in his office. :: Dr. Young would would explain the what and why of the labs, and was more than willing to answer questions. He would occasionally ask how things were going if we ran into each other in the lab during the week. :: He demonstrated passion and humor to the class and was always happy to help for the sake of our learning. :: He would help whenever he could and often offered advice as how to accomplish a certain aspect of the lab. :: Showing us the results of the lab and what we could expect.  Good incentive/motivation for doing the labs as best as possible. :: he was very interested in what we needed help with and was always there to answer questions. He always gave clear and concise instructions. :: Yes"
1270,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom. :: Very well! He responded to emails fairly quickly and when he was in office he would respond to any questions. :: In the classroom the communication was very good. Out of class, his communication was not as fast as it was in the classroom, but that is to be expected. :: very effective communication both through email and in class. :: Classroom communication was clear, concise, and efficient. Outside of class didn't need to happen that much, but a mass email got what he needed to say across just fine. :: Very well. :: Very well in the classroom. Email would take him some time to respond back. But when he did, the answers were very helpful. :: Good both in and out. :: He did a very good job explaining what he wanted from us and what he expected the final outcome to be. He was always willing to answer questions and responds promptly to emails. :: Very Well"
1271,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course outline and ""lectures"" were fine, but not exactly what is in the syllabus or in the labs.  I believe this is due to the class never having enough time to actually do all of the labs, so they usually omit one, which leads to confusion when this professor decides to do the last two at the same time. :: Somewhat, some times he was scattered throughout, but it wasn't always. :: Not really, but they were not hard to follow either. The classes were more of a on-the-go environment, talking about things and issues as they came about. :: for the most part; however the first two labs seemed to take way too long and the last two were rushed. The first lab understandably took longer because there were more new things to learn, but we did not need as much time for the second lab as we were given and it ended up rushing the last two labs quite a bit. :: Organization was rather freeform, as the course is mostly student-driven in that the instructor gives the project requirements, explains how you might fulfill them, and then turns the students loose to actually do the work. Whenever there was something that needed to be lectured, though, Dr. Young knew what needed to be said. :: There was no lecture, but rather an open lab. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
1272,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes/. :: Yes. :: Yes, in my experiences he was. :: yes. :: Dr Young was hard to get a hold of in person, as he had his own work he was doing most of the time. He was quick to respond to emails, though, with one time in which he responded to an email within an hour and a half on a Sunday night in the middle of the Thanksgiving Break. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he was usually in his office and was always willing and happy to help us if problems arose. :: yes"
1273,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- While I understand that experience doing all 4 labs as well as doing the ""fun"" lab, #4, to assign both at the same time with only two weeks left in class, or two class periods total, as well as the large reports that are due with them, seemed very rushed.  Neither lab got the attention it probably deserved and the results of both could have been more in depth if they were done separately. Doing an additional lab, which requires a lot of polishing and mounting and microscopy is not ""fun"" when you also have another huge project due at the same time. :: Dr. Young was an excellent instructor and I enjoyed the course very much. :: I really enjoyed the class, however it was a lot of outside work and consumed a lot of my time during the week in order to keep up with all the work. I think that for a 1 credit hour class, it was a little too much work, and think it wouldn't be a bad idea to increase the amount of hours the class was worth. Also, the labs weren't very well spread out as we have both two lab reports as well as a lab due for this class for finals week alone. Otherwise, the class was very enjoyable. :: Overall this was an extremely helpful class as far as reinforcing learning concepts from ME2700 and learning new lab techniques to put on a resume. However, the end of the semester was very stressful since grades for the first two labs were still not available for review up til the last week of the lecture, and 60% of the total grade was due during finals week. It would be very helpful to get the first lab report back, graded and with comments, before the second lab writeup is due so that we could know how well we were doing with our lab report writing. It would also be helpful for the pacing to be a little more even. :: An excellent professor, and a pleasure to work with. I hope that we might be able to work together once again in the future. :: He is an awesome teacher who does an amazing job. We all had a great semester with him. :: The professor is great, this is a great class, but it's not worth one credit hour. The amount of work we have to do outside of class is not worth the one credit hour. It should be, at minimum, two credit hours as we are to do so much of the labs outside of class. :: no"
1274,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: For his first time teaching this course in a while, I would say it went well. :: This professor did well in trying to explain material and using up the entire class period. However, most of the classes seemed to involve derivations instead of how to apply the concepts to real world problems or example problems. Therefore, a lot of his classes seemed more confusing than helpful. Furthermore, he did not seem prepared for lectures sometimes, that were shown by making math errors consistently throughout the semester. Overall, he is a good instructor and willing to help. :: well. :: Dr. Young is a very good instructor. He presents the theory in a way that students will understand, and provides example problems to reinforce the theory. The only complaint is how scatter-brained his lectures can get. :: Not very effective. Always messed up on examples and spent too much time fixing them in class. :: Mildly effective. :: 10/10. :: excellent. :: Very effective instructor! Teaches clearly and thoroughly. :: Dr. Young was a good professor but he has some flaws that affect his effectiveness in the classroom. I will go into more details about these flaws in other sections of this evaluation. :: Decent instructor overall, covers a good balance between theory and examples of the information. :: Overall, he gave a good explanation of the subject and worked to answer any questions students had. He even would remember to talk about it the next class if he didn't know the answer that class. :: good. :: Henry Young is somewhat effective. The reason I say somewhat is because he get the theory and the example problems on the board wrong so things just get even more confusing. I give him the benefit of the doubt since he has not taught this class for a while. He truly does care about his students though. :: Half the time he was pretty effective and the other half he even seemed confused by what he was saying. :: Dr. Young's teaching style meshed with how I learn best, so in that sense he was an effective instructor. The balance of theory and example problems was good enough for me. :: Not very effective. :: Professor has a good heart and bless it, he tries.  He tries to do examples and things in class to get his point across.  The problem is, he is SO unorganized.  He loses his place, makes many errors in front of the class, has to stand there for many minutes at a time trying to regroup himself and figure out where he is.   But hey, he hasn't given up and he usually tries to clear up his mistakes.  Fair grader. :: Very good professor, we all enjoyed the class. :: Works out problems that you would actually see on exams in class. :: The instructor is very effective at teaching mechanics of materials, and shows a large interest in the subject as well as teaching it. :: The instructor presented the content clearly, defined and explained the theory well and gave ample relevant examples. However there were some occasions where the lectures moved too slowly. Overall quite effective. :: Very scatter-brained. :: He was very effective in the class. :: He was a pretty good professor overall. Probably 3.5/5, would not mind taking again. :: Although a bit unorganized at times, he explains things very well and the train of thought can be very easy to follow. :: I enjoyed Dr. Young's teaching. He always taught with energy and I think that it made the material more enjoyable. He did make mistakes in his math sometimes but he always worked to correct them. :: Somewhat effective. He gave good examples in class and was always willing to answer questions, but he frequently seemed unprepared for the lecture. A few times it seemed like he'd never looked at the notes for that day. :: The teacher really cares about the students and them comprehending the material. With that being said, the teacher sometimes gets off track in his own work and makes many mistakes while doing problems on the board, he does catch and fix them and gives you great feedback on what he expects from you as a student in his class. :: Dr. Young was fairly effective. The lectures were sometimes confusing because he said he hadn't taught the class in a while. At one point we spent two lectures on one problem because he wasn't sure of his notes. I'm not saying it was terrible at all, but a lot of us were confused frequently. :: Dr. Young was very effective in class; he explained everything thoroughly throughout the semester. He often made mistakes during lecture, but these errors had little to no effect on my understanding of the course material, and he was able to correct himself most of the time. :: Dr. Young was fairly effective. I thought he spent too much time working through the theory and derivation of equations making it less effective. :: He is a decent professor, pretty laid back. :: Clear in his speech. Can be scrambled or appear jumbled when solving a problem. :: Dr. Young is a very effective instructor. He explains things very well and helps anyone who has questions. :: Very effective. :: great. :: Pretty effective. :: Good teacher willing to help students out even when he makes mistakes. :: At the beginning of the class, he seemed well put together and organized. He got to the point and taught well. At the end of the semester; however, he was very disorganized, and his lessons are filled with mistakes and errors. This results in standardized equations being copied down incorrectly by students. :: Was not very effective for this course. I have heard he is better at other courses. :: Sometimes a bit messy, but always tries his best to make everything clear and understandable for every student."
1275,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Do not spring a project on students that is not explicitly mentioned in the syllabus. I know it falls under in class activities, but with the other workload from classes, adding something like that at the end of the semester without mentioning it prior is not appropriate. It was a good activity, but I think it should have been mentioned more in depth earlier on. Students have a lot of other work. :: Yes, the professor graded us by all of the standards listed in the syllabus. He gave us deadlines and dates for all of the projects, exams and homework. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Somewhat. A group project was given for the last two weeks of class, without being told in advance. There was a unused 10% of the grade in the syllabus listed as ""in-class activities and quizzes"" which we were never given. This 10% was used for the surprise group project. This project was also in assigned groups, making it very hard to coordinate with group members during the busiest time of the semester when insufficient class time was given to complete this project. Of the two project choices, the content of one was being taught until the second to last class, leaving the students with insufficient knowledge of the subject for in class group work time. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was straightforward in his expectations in his syllabus and he graded based on that. :: Yes, very fair and honest instructor. More professors should follow his example. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes for the most part, however he did say at the beginning of the semester he would give out about 5 pop quizzes throughout the semester and never ended up doing so. Instead he decided to have us do a group project within the last few weeks of the semester. I wouldâve rather he been upfront about what we would be graded on so I couldâve planned accordingly. :: Yes, work was evaluated as expected. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor does a very good job of evaluating  your work based on the expectations he lays out. :: Yes, instructor closely followed syllabus with small alterations based to keep pace with the semester. :: Yes, mostly. The in-class activity was thrown in right at the end of the semester. :: yes. :: I don't have a huge problem with his grading. Exam problems seemed to be graded a little too harshly, but the curves and easy homework points helped make up for it. :: Grading criteria was clear throughout the class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part; however, at the beginning of the semester, we were told that we would be graded on our attendance by having random pop quizzes. He never gave us a single quiz in class. To make up for this, he decided to give us an in-class group design project which would take place of the attendance grade. He did not tell us about this project until mid-November. We were supposed to get 30 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays to work on this assignment, but almost every time we would only be given about 10-15 minutes. Along with this, he did not teach us the material that was needed for this project until about a week and a half before it was due. This gave us only two (partial) class periods to actually work on the project. As a result, most of this last minute ""in-class"" project had to be done outside of class. :: Yes, Dr. Young followed the course syllabus exactly. :: Yes he did. :: Yes, fair evaluator. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the only complaint I have is the lack of explanation of the grades on the midterms. On several problems the only explanation was because he took off that many points for everyone. :: Yes - there were no surprises. Dr. Young was very clear with his course expectations. :: Exams were rough and graded inconsistently in my opinion. :: Although the Syllabus is short, you always know what the next lesson will be about."
1276,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: The professor always started class on time and used the entire class period. At some points he would go five minutes over, which caused conflict with the class following us. However, he consistently utilized the who period for lecture or class activities. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always on time and always used every minute of class. :: Yes. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. We actually needed more time to learn all the material, but Mr. Young was able to teach everything needed in the time allotted. :: Class always started on time and we would use the entire class period. Sometimes we would run over a few minutes so that we could finish a problem that we were working on. :: Yes. :: Class always started on time and ended on time. :: yes. :: Yes, we always started on time and there were a couple of times we left a little early but nothing to worry about. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Always from start to end. :: Yes, the instructor is very punctual. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yep. :: Instructor was always on timed and partitioned classes well. :: Yes. :: While he mostly started on time, there were a few instances of tardiness. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Young started and ended class on time. :: Yes, he would most times use more than the allotted time in class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes almost every class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He used the whole class period, but often didn't finish the lesson. He would have to go over and fix the problems from the prior day. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, only once or twice a few minutes late."
1277,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Young is very cordial and receptive to questions. He is fair and takes feedback to heart. He even changed the date of a midterm for our class because we voiced that we had several in the same week as his. :: He answered questions readily, and encouraged thinking. :: The instructor demonstrated interest by frequently asking if we had questions about the material. He would stop class to answer any questions and help people in understanding the material covered. :: yes. :: Dr. Young made sure every student understood the theory/example being discussed, and made sure to provide each question asked a suitable answer. :: Was very open to questions and concerned about our understanding. :: Made sure the class understood the content by asking questions, explaining pieces of the lecture again, etc. :: 10/10 Related real world applications to what we were learning. :: did good job. :: Yes, Mr. Young shows a genuine enthusiasm for Materials Engineering and teaching it. :: He was very interested in this topic and it reflected in his teaching. He also related everything to real world scenarios so that we would have a better understanding of the topic. :: Yes. :: How he taught the class showed that he had an interest in the class. He was always passionate about the subject and his students. :: yes. :: He would research a question that someone asked in class if he did not know it and made sure that he would answer that students question correctly the next class day. :: Questions were answered thoroughly. More time was spent on topics considered difficult. Topics the class struggled with were gone over in greater detail, including exam debriefs. :: He answered all questions. :: yes. :: yes. :: Would always stop teaching to help someone with a question, very helpful. :: Yes, the instructor is very passionate about the subject and its impact on your future, and also the learning of his students. :: Yes. Instructor check numerous times to make sure class was following and answer all questions. :: he did not. :: yes. :: Always attempted to answer all our questions, looked up information that he didn't know for later. Seemed to care well enough. :: Henry always kept a good connection with the students in and out of class. :: Dr. Young was always available to talk when he was in his office, even if it wasn't during office hours. That alone made him one of the best teachers I've ever had. :: He was very willing and interested in answering questions regardless of the complexity. He was very effective at explaining concepts as well. :: was always available, answered every question asked. :: He made sure that if we had a question, he'd have an answer by the end of lecture or by the next lecture. :: He made sure everyone understood the material by answering the many questions that were asked in class to the best of his ability. :: Dr. Young would allow adequate time for questions throughout lecture and would stop lecture if a question came up that needed further explanation. :: He demonstrated good interest. :: Was very enthusiastic when answering questions and if he was unable to answer at first, he went back and figured out the problem and made sure we had an answer. :: He was excited to teach us and he was excited when he saw that we were learning. Showed that he actually cared about the education of his students. :: Actively answering questions and trying to engage the class. :: coming prepared to class everyday. :: Very passionate teaching. :: He gave examples related to the course textbook and briefly explained the concept before explaining how to solve the problem. :: Dr. Young was always willing to answer questions, and encouraged them. :: Interested in our learning, but lectures were more theoretical than concrete and exams were concrete. :: I could always ask him if I had a question. (In the lesson and afterwards as well)"
1278,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: Very effectively. :: The teacher responded back to any email that I sent within a day's time. He was helpful in answering questions after class too. However, the one time that I attempted to go to his office hours, he was not in his room. :: well. :: Dr. Young was very clear in his expectations both in and out of the classroom. :: Very effectively. :: Well. :: 10/10. :: effective and good enough. :: He always answers any questions in and out of class. :: Very well. :: Communication outside of the classroom was great. He was always available in his office and through email. However, in the class, communication was a little off. He would be asked a question and sometimes he would answer it fine and other times he would try to answer a question and would end up confusing us more in the end. :: Well. :: Communication was always good in and out of class. :: good. :: He communicated well in and outside of class. :: He seemed lost a lot of the time and tended to get fairly flustered if there was a question asked. He also said that a certain kind of problem was going to be asked on our exam which was never asked so that mightâve thrown a bunch of people off if they were studying that specific problem for a large chunk of time. :: Effective communication all around. :: Very well. :: he is always willing to help. Communicates well in and out of class. :: very good. :: NA. :: The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom. :: Quite. :: Fine. Was late uploading documents that were promised in class. :: Very well. He would send emails regarding homework or class. :: Generally, I understood the points that he was trying to get across to the class. :: well. :: Dr. Young communcated very well both in and out of the classroom. He made the scope of the material we needed to know for exams very clear and was always available to talk when he was in his office. :: He communicated effectively. :: very well. :: Communication was very effective. :: He did a great job. :: Dr. Young was effective in communicating with the class about homework postings and assignments for the design project. :: He communicated decently, it could have been better. :: well. :: Very well. :: Very effective. :: well. :: Very. :: He communicated well. :: He communicated effectively. :: Yes. :: see answer above."
1279,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Not all the time, but again, for the first time teaching it in a few years, I think kinks always need to be worked out. :: The class and content were decently organized. The instructor had material to go over but sometimes the professor seemed unorganized. For some classes he would make many mathematical mistakes that would carry over many class periods and cause confusion. Overall, the professor could improve a little on his organization of his material and what he is teaching. With this he would save class time and confuse students less. :: lecture could have been slightly more organized. :: The course content was very well organized. The lectures were well organized. :: Very well organized. :: Somewhat. Wasn't very prepared for class. Often times didn't understand own lecture notes or would incorrectly copy information from notes to board. Wasted time and made lectures confusing. :: 8/10 Sometimes lectures were a little all over the place or had a few continuity errors. Other than that the lectures were good. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes, but really more time is needed to go over the material better. :: Here is where his flaws are. I do not feel like the lecture was well organized. There were some lectures where he was very scatterbrained and we would spend an entire class working one problem and not even finish it because he would constantly make mistakes. I would not be so upset about the mistakes if it wasn't for the fact that he had the solutions in his hand and still made a lot of mistakes. Some of the mistakes he wouldn't catch until he was at the end of the problem and his calculations wouldn't be matching up. There was one week we spent all 3 days of class going over one problem because he would continually make mistakes. I really wish he would have uploaded his lectures on pilot so that maybe we could have followed along with his and possibly catch his mistakes as he makes them. :: Somewhat, others were more or less so. The more prepared he came the better the class was. :: Yes, everything was well organized. :: yes. :: For the most part. I did not care that it took two classes just to solve one problem. I would have also liked to see a little less theory and more examples. The class was about 65% theory and 35% problems. :: Course content was well organized on pilot. Lectures felt haphazard a lot of the time and not practiced. :: The course was well organized throughout the semester. On a day-to-day basis, some lectures seemed underprepared for (maybe 1/5) which could lead to some confusion on my end. :: Not very organized. :: no. :: yes. :: Somewhat, the lectures can vary in organization. :: Yes, with the exception of the ""final project"" which was only revealed in the last few weeks of class and seemed very rushed. :: Course contact was well organized. The instructors notes may not have. There were a few difficulties and mishaps with working from notes. This was at times distracting and potentially confusing. :: not really - seemed to jump around a lot. Wish there was more examples rather than so much theory worked out in class. :: yes. :: He seems a little scatterbrained sometimes. Sometimes struggled to follow his examples from his notes. In this regard, he could have been more prepared for lectures. :: very well. :: Yes. :: While the content was organized, the lectures frequently felt all over the place or incredibly confusing. Sometimes, it seemed he hadn't looked at the lecture notes before. :: yes. :: Lectures were at times unorganized and left us confused, but I'd say 85% of the time they were organized. :: For the most part. He was a little scatterbrained at times, but overall he did a good job staying on track. :: Yes, they were well organized for the most part. Sometimes, Dr. Young would get lost in the solutions or take up three class periods to explain on point when I could read it or find the equation in the book and have a solid understanding of the concept within 30 minutes versus 2h40m. :: Yes, and no. Some days it would be organized and other days he would have no idea what was going on. :: could stand more organization. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Mainly. :: The content was explained well.  The lectures were explained well but if it were more organized it could have been more understandable. :: No they were not. :: I found providing multiple ways to solve problems spanning over several days to be a bit confusing - but that's partially due to the short class time.  I also believe that providing the equation first, then describing the theory behind it may be clearer. I personally write every thing down during each lecture- but it may have been more helpful for me to know I have the necessary equation down in my notes, then 'soak in' the theory behind it. :: Lectures were very unorganized for this course. Would spend several classes on derivations of equations provided in the book and not enough example problems worked through. :: it was ok."
1280,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, he was, even for questions that did not pertain to his class. :: The only time that I tried to visit the professor in his office hours, he was not in his room. However, the professor was still easily contacted through email. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always available by email and in office hours. :: Yes. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was always in his office during his office hours and always responded to emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I only went once, but yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he is always available. :: Although I didn't need to spend time in office hours, the one grading issue I had was solved fairly and promptly. :: yes. :: seemed to be. :: yes. :: Definitely. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he was very responsive. :: Yes, Dr. Young was always available for office hours and very responsive to emails. :: Yes he was. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very easy to get in touch with. :: Yes. :: Yes he was"
1281,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. Maybe. No time. :: Overall, he is a good professor, but he could work on organization of the class and what will be covered on the exams. There were many questions on expectations for exams, therefore, it would be more helpful if he covered more examples and informed the class what topics to review. :: no. :: No. :: Good teacher. Okay class. Lectures always felt rushed and there weren't a variety of examples problems. Usually only had time for one of each type of problem. :: Doctor Young is overall a really good professor. He does a really good job of explaining the material and knows his stuff. The homework and exams can be difficult but reasonable. I would take this professor again for other classes as well, given the chance to. Good Job Doctor Young!. :: No. :: Perhaps with more time and without a student who continually interrupts the class. But these are things against the class and not the instructor. :: Please post lecture material on pilot. It would have helped out greatly I believe. :: Good instructor overall. :: He was a really good professor, but he can lose his train of thought easy. If a student asks a question, sometimes it felt like he got completely lost in class. He would rebound in a couple minutes, but it just make class a little disconnected. :: good. :: Prof Young should write a little bigger on the board and stick to black marker. Also it might be beneficial to run through lectures ahead of time so they are more polished and prepared. :: I enjoyed this course, its content and the instructor. :: I enjoyed the class and the professor made that huge difference. I think the one major thing challenging Dr. Young is time. This is not a 50 min class kind of course. He is so thorough that we could only do one question each class. If class is only going to be 50 min. long, Dr. Young cannot completely convey the entire subject. :: Good professor, I recommend. :: The instructor teaches the class very well, but i do not think this class should be taught in 3 separate 55 minute lectures a week, because that is barely enough time to cover one concept or one problem, and on multiple occasions was not enough time to even finish a problem. :: Well run class, enjoyable, good teaching skills.  The class project was started at a good time but the half classes at a time seemed less convenient then setting a class per week aside for the project. Also I was not aware there was a project till it started. :: no. :: nope. :: Use the digital pen instead of board, it would simplify things. :: I hope I can take another class with Dr. Young!. :: I'd say for our final project, it may need to be changed to content that we have learned up until the date of assignment. We had a week left of in-class time to work and had just learned the material we needed to solve the project. :: No. :: Work more problems. Don't dwell so much on the theory, when Dr. Young could just provide the equation and then walk through how to apply the equation within a problem. I think that'd helped students far more than the theory does. If the students need more explanation, then refer them to the book. Otherwise, Dr. Young was a good instructor and I enjoyed the class and have a better understanding of the structures around me. :: Questions on exams were way too tricky to the point where individuals with Master degrees in engineering got them incorrect. :: No. :: no. :: Good professor. :: No. :: I know this is probably more department related topic, but this class should last much longer than 55 minutes. It's very hard to grasp a concept when examples have to be split over several days due to the time constraint. I think a 2+ hour class would be beneficial to many. :: I feel as though he may have been over burdened by needing to teach this course due to budget cuts. But there also wasn't much structure to his lectures which was a detriment to myself. He curved exams rather fairly when he knew he made the exams too difficult for the time allotted to take them. :: Returning of homework can take a very long time.  He helped me a lot in the beginning to be able to participate in his class."
1282,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He's one of the best instructors I've ever had! I love that he's not only knowledgeable, but makes you stretch just enough to grow as a students. And he's super corny, which is a plus, I love silly humor. :: Above average professor, thinks we should just learn the material overnight and has high expectations of students. Difficult tests and does't even teach the material just does problems over it. Really needs to change his teaching style. :: The instructors enthusiasm really helps with learning something that otherwise is very dry. :: the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well. :: Pretty good. :: Loved this course because of how fun he made it. :: Good. :: Scott Thomas is a very good professor overall.  He was a little bit odd at times, but not in a bad way. :: Scott Thomas was effective in breaking down more complicated topics and presenting them in a step by step format. :: He is a fantastic teacher and is effective. :: Not particularly effective at explaining how to use Matlab, or how it works. :: Awesome. He has a whole lot of energy. He also displays great interest in us as students. :: Cool guy, ok instructor. :: Class was very effective and taught very well, he showed a lot of enthusiasm when in class and made the class fun and worth coming to. :: Very good Professor but the course is very hard to teach. Does not explain things just kinda puts examples up and says do these problems. :: very efffective. :: Instructor did a wonderful job thoroughly going over material. :: Mr. Thomas was a very effective instructor. He kept the class engaging and fun. He was clear on the topics and made sure all students were treated with respect and fairness. :: -. :: Did very well especially considering how large of a class there was. :: Very effective. :: Poor. :: Very effective, i have no complaints about this man. He kept your attention and took interest in your learning. Made the class challenging, but gave you everything you needed to succeed. :: Scott is freaking awesome. I would be lost in Matlab world without him. Truly. The way he teaches is phenomenal, and I can't wait to take more of his classes. :: Dr Thomas did a great job conveying the content. He was very effective, and gave us time to work on the practice problems and help if needed, but allowed us to try to figure it out instead of just forcing all the content on us. :: great. :: He is good, but I think his exams are too hard."
1283,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Exactly so. :: Yes, always stayed on track. :: His syllabus is followed very tightly. :: Yes. :: Yep. :: Absolutely. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Stuck to the syllabus strictly. :: yes. :: All the work on the syllabus was covered very well. :: yes very strict. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He did evaluate work based on the syllabus. :: -. :: Followed the course syllabus exactly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he followed his syllabus to a tee. :: Yes he did. :: yes"

""It's 5 o'clock exACTly, ALLLright!"". :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Class alwasy started and ended when it was suppose to. Very organized!!. :: yes. :: yes. :: Always 5:00 pm exactly, and utilized all class time effectively. :: Mr. Thomas would always start class exactly on time. He used the entire period. :: -. :: Never started class late once and used the entire period everytime. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the only time class would start a little bit late was on exam days because all the computers had to be put into offline mode and there was a class in that room before. Totally understandable. :: YES. This guy started class EXACTLY at 5. EVERY TIME. The most punctual I have ever seen ANY instructor. :: Yes Dr Thomas did start on time ""5 O'clock exactly"". That is how routinely we started class, and we went the full time. :: yes. :: yes"
1285,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes!. :: Yes. :: He provided many real world examples with great enthusiasm that aided in learning. :: Yes he motivate me and make love learning. :: Yep. :: Through many examples, homework, and testing. :: He made it clear that he was trying to help people understand what they were doing instead of just memorize a bunch of matlab commands. :: He was very enthusiastic and was into every students growth in learning. :: He sort of did.  He would come and ""help"" if we were having issues with a problem but often times his explanation was poor/nonexistent. :: ""Questions, questions, questions"" - always asked if people needed help. :: very interactive, always walks around to every table to help students and make sure they undersatnd. :: He showed his interest and made class a blast with his humor and outgoing attitude. He always came to class happy and ready to show us the ways of matlab. :: seemed excited everyday. :: yes. :: Very much so. :: He would constantly give real examples of when to use the topics. He kept the class engaging. :: -. :: He very frequently made sure everyone in the class understood the material and would personally help those who didnt, even though it was a massive class. :: Yes. :: Answered all of our questions. :: He had a lot of interest. He tried to help you however he could. :: It wasn't just all about coding, but about engineering too. He spoke about various application, which was awesome. :: He was always willing to help, and answer any questions we may of had. He also was willing to come in and help if we needed it. He was. :: examples. :: He frequently discussed applications of matlab to real world phenomena."
1286,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Yes. :: Very well. :: very well. :: Dr.  Thomas is very nice and like to help and explains the material very well. :: Yep. :: Awesome. :: Good for the most part.  At the beginning of each class, he would go over the schedule briefly to make sure that people knew what they were doing that day. :: well. :: he stuck strictly to his syllibus. :: Not well. :: Very well. :: ok. :: Was very easy to communicate to and easy to talk to. :: very well. :: yes. :: Instructor was very apt to see students understand and succeed. :: Mr. Thomas was very effective at communicating. He was always clear. He would even respond to e-mails within 24 hours. :: -. :: Very well. :: Very well. :: very well. :: He communicated very well.

1287,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Kind of, not really lectures, just does problems and helps out on them but doesn't teach any material. :: yes. :: The lecture is very organized and we spend it on doing problems and practicing. :: Eh. :: Very well organized, could not have asked for anything better. Perfect structure. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not particularly. Often times I would be confused about what was being said, and sooner or later would stop caring and just hope that the class would end sooner. Lectures were very disorganized, and an entire section was not taught in class, but was still on the exam. He just said (roughly) ""I don't have time to teach this material in class, so you are responsible for learning it"" two days before the exam that would have that material. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Every lecture was very organized and well thought out. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: They were well organized. :: -. :: Everything was set up before class, there was never ant ""on he fly"" things. :: Yes. :: NO!!! Covered way too much in too little of time. :: Yes very organized and he kept your attention. :: Yes they were, and followed the syllabus just as stated.

1289,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Scott Thomas is a great instructor and this is a great class. I wish Physics majors were required to take this class, I only took it as an elective to fill in my schedule to full time senior year. Knowing alot of this stuff earlier would have made many hw assignments over the years easier!. :: Great professor I love that he relates what you are learning to the real world so you have a feel of how what you are learning is important. :: No, Thank you. :: Nope. :: None. Thank you so much for a GREAT semester!. :: No. :: no. :: His policy on homework is ""no later than when the dropbox is due"" and that's it, regardless of whatever excuse you may have. While this isn't uncommon in colleges, it has no place in this class. On a number of occasions I was unable to turn in homework due to some bizarre Matlab error on my computer; it would crash when I would try to publish my code as a .pdf, and because of this I would have nothing to turn into the Dropbox. Thomas would not hear what was wrong with my computer, and refused to acknowledge my work despite knowing full well that I had completed the assignment before the deadline. :: no. :: I would like to thank him for a wonderful semester. :: -. :: Dr. Thomas is an amazing instructor who is extremely passionate about what he does. While he is in some ways a ""hard"" teacher because he follows the syllabus exactly with 0 deviations, at least you always know what to expect. I very much enjoyed him as an instructor and would love to have him for other classes. :: Scott did a great job. Very likeable. :: Great guy, bad at teaching Matlab. Goes on even if the class isn't understanding the topic. :: 4.9 out of 5 stars would definitely take him again. :: Dr Thomas did a great job teaching this course and providing plenty of example problems and practice. He also provided plenty of help for students to succeed. :: no"
1290,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He's very effective ... he should have taught thermodynamics 1 too. :: Very well organized professor.  Can tell that he wants the student to learn always excited to teach in class. :: yes. :: Scott Thomas overall is a very effective teacher. He takes the time to care about his students and really helps you apply the subject to real world context. :: Very effective. :: Very effective. :: Scott is a fantastic instructor.  I have had Dr. Thomas for 2 classes now and have learned so much.  Scott is always on time and makes class fun and enjoyable. :: I think he gives plenty of resources that allow for anyone to succeed in this class. I enjoyed the lectures because he is a funny guy, but is also effective in his teaching. :: very effective. :: I took him for a previous class and i still believe he is one of the best professors here at wright state university. :: He is very understanding and knows the material very well. :: 10/10 Great Professor. :: You will not find a more effect professor at this University, or maybe even the state of Ohio. Dr. Thomas is fantastic. :: Overall, I had a good experience in Statics. I'm doing fairly well in the course (about a low A). I think you do a great job with answering questions in class, but I think you should focus your lectures more on the concepts of statics and I think you should spend some time linking the physics behind statics to the example problems from the lecture. Often times, when I would get to a big end of chapter problem I had issues linking that back to physics concepts. Also, I like your optimism in the classroom. It keeps me focused on an inherently boring topic. However, I did feel distracted by a lot of the joking in lecture. I mean it's fun and all, but let's keep a positive attitude and focus on the subject. I did enjoy this semester though!. :: Dr. Thomas was one of the best professors I have ever had. He was very good at teaching the material and worked hard to ensure all students understood the material. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Thomas is an absolutely fantastic professor! One of the best at Wright State. He is extremely effective.

He told us on the very first day that one of his most important words for the class is ""Fair."" He makes sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. He cares about the students and makes class fun. :: Great teacher, he is probably one of the best engineering professors in this school. He is an amazing professor who genuinely cares. I do believe on one of the exams he expected a little too much i felt there was not a lot of time and the majority of the class did not finish or turn in their exams but think this is not his fault since the class length got cut in half from his previous classes he is still adjusting. I learned a lot and enjoyed his class very much. The course was challenging but was manageable with how well Scott was able to teach the class. :: This professor did a good job at teaching however his lectures were always a bit rushed and at times hard to follow. :: instructor was great! very effective at teaching the material and kept class fun and entertaining. :: He is a great professor when it comes to teaching.

Sometimes the examples ran together and became a little monotonous but I also have a short attention span. :: Scott Thomas is an amazing professor who truly cares for his students. :: Scott Thomas was incredibly effective as a teacher.  A lot of my best teachers were the ones that gave numerous examples, and he is no exception.  He used a lot of examples, encouraged class questions, participation, and even allowed us, when we were confused about a methodology, to talk it out to him and each other in class, and he would help us figure it out.  He also was a fun teacher to have and created a positive learning environment. :: He is a very engaging instructor and made the classroom have a very friendly environment. :: very effective"

Sounds good to me. :: Yes, he started class as he said, at 12:20 exactly!. :: Always exactly on time. Used full class even if we finished early to go over extra examples. :: Dr. Thomas would start class at 1:20 exactly every single class. Then he would use all of the class period to make sure we are getting the most information we can during that block,. :: Yes he would always start class with ""It's 12:20 exactly."". :: Yes he did. :: Yes, every class was started promptly at 12:20 and took up the entire time allotted almost every day. :: Yes. :: Yes he did.

1293,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Best teacher that i have had a wright state. :: yup. :: He takes the time to understand you as a person and not only a number in the class. Scott takes the time to connect the subject to how it will be applied in a real engineering job. He makes the class light hearted and not so serious. :: yes. :: Asking questions to keep students attentive and having problems due at end of class to see if people were catching on. :: Yes, he made asking questions easy and was not judgmental about any ""dumb questions"". :: Yes, he had office hours and answered all questions to his best ability during class. He also provided plenty of resources to help all students. :: Made class fun, made jokes. :: He was very interactive with starting new topics, he would make the lectures as fast and interactive as possible. :: answered all questions equally. :: Very interactive class, cares very much for his students and their understanding in the topics discussed in class. :: He constantly reminded us that if we had additional questions, to come to him during office hours. With that being said, I believe most questions got answered in class. He made it a specific point to make sure everyone in the class was comfortable asking questions which really stood out to me. :: Keeping a positive attitude and making us feel comfortable asking questions. A lot of times in the science and engineering courses, professors can cultivate an esoteric atmosphere, which is harmful to students. That is not evident here! I felt comfortable asking questions. :: Dr. Thomas made the class fun! He peaked students learning by making the class interesting, and also communicated with the students in class. :: Probed is to ask relevant questions and often brought up topics related to the subject that are relevant to our field. :: Dr. Thomas cares about every single one of his students.

This helps to keep everybody on the same page during the lecture. :: He made sure class was fair. He provided all the homework questions on separate handouts and gave solutions to every question on those handouts. He provided every previous exam he had given and the solutions. :: He would respond to emails and questions quickly and to the best of his ability. :: was very willing to spend extra time on individual students questions or to meet outside of class to answer them. :: He made it super easy and when I had questions he answred them really well for me to understand. Overall he is a great professskr take him if you are taking statics. :: Dr. Thomas takes an interest in ensuring that his students are able to understand the material, as well as ensuring the well-being of his students. :: Providing endless resources to make us responsible for our learning. :: Very open to any and all questions during class.

Not an issue. :: Dr. Thomas emailed me back very quickly when I had a question, and offered to help me during office hours when ever I could attend. :: Very well. :: Dr. Thomas is always available though email or stopping by his office hours. :: He answered questions and had very flexible office hours. :: He was a good responder. :: His in class communication was very good, and I did not contact him out of class at all so I can not judge that. However, he did email us after each midterm as soon as he had finished grading the test to let us know the grades were in, which I thought was very helpful. :: The instructor communicated effectively inside and outside the classroom. :: He communicated very well throughout the semester both in and out of class. :: He communicated well but as stated earlier, he seems to always be rushed which sometimes makes it difficult to understand material he teaches. :: very effectively. answered emails promptly and was very helpful. :: Amazing in the class he was super great. The issue that I had is in his office hours, there were lots of people there and also he flies through what u needed help with.

If that makes sense? Like every time we would cover a new ""concept"" it would take two seconds to lecture about it and then we would go do problems. THIS IS OKAY, BUT I feel like it would've been better if you highlighted the concepts more instead of burying ourselves in example problems (that's what the homework is for!. :: Yes, every class he walked into he had a plan for. :: Yes, he knew what he doing each and every day. :: The content and lectures are extremely organized. It feels like Dr. Thomas has every single thing we do planned out in advance, which maximizes our learning. :: Yes. :: Yes he was well organized. :: Yes, he had a clear set of lesson plans that flowed well between each class, and the homework problems were all similar to the problems we did together in class. :: Yes. :: They were very organized. :: He is very organized. He lectures over theory and then gives examples for each chapter. :: yes. :: They were very organized, everything was perfectly planned. Didnât had an issue with that. He made everything interesting to learn. The issue that I had was the exams are worth 90% of the overall grade. :: Each day has a specified topic, the lecture notes he works from are all available online, and everything you could ever want as additional reference material is also available online. He's got a good system going, and he sticks to it. :: Yes, he was always prepared. :: very well organized. :: Yes extremely well organized. :: Yes, followed syllabus perfectly. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the material was very well organized and material from each section flowed into the next chapters material. :: yes"

His office hours were well documented in the syllabus.  He was also responsive online through his email. :: He was. However I would not be the best person to ask since I never needed assistance. :: Yes, he responded to emails very quickly and had office hours everyday we had class. :: absolutely. :: He was available during his office hours, the issue is that there is lots of people there so he flies through the questions that u ask him. This was the biggest issue that I had. :: Reach out to him, and he's there. Dr. Thomas has got your back. :: Yes. :: very responsive. :: Yes. I would get a response within 24 hours. :: yes. :: yes. :: I cannot judge , as I rarely contacted him outside of class. :: Yes, even though I never needed to use his office hours he made it very clear that he would always be available.. :: yes"
1297,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I think his exams are too much of the grade..especially if there gonna be as hard as he makes them. I think maybe he should add a course project or something instead of exams being 90% of the grade. :: very well spoken teacher respects any and all questions no matter how dumb of a question. Best teacher hopefully able to take more classes with this professor in the future. :: N/a. :: Second time around taking this class and I really like his teaching style. :: No. :: Scott is a fantastic professor and a great person.  I have thoroughly enjoyed being in his class. :: He was a great instructor for this course. :: professor of the year award goes to him! Every year!. :: Great professor and one of the nicest guys on campus. :: I feel bad for the students who didn't have the opportunity to take Dr. Thomas this semester. I really do. :: Overall, a good experience. If anything, I would say you need to push your students a little more. I know for example that I had a habit of just copying down the homework solutions from the website. I know it's not your job to make us take the initiative, but when all of the students taking this class are about in their second year of classes and taking 18 credit hours of hard math and core courses, this class can become less of a priority, WHICH SHOULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE ME CLASS. I know that's not your fault, but overall your students might get something more if there were more intermediate examinations, like in class quizzes or something to kind of force us to study. At any rate, thanks for teaching this semester!. :: Dr. Thomas was probably one of my favorite professors. He was fair, helpful, affective at teaching the material, and I would recommend/sign up for any other class he taught. :: Dr. Thomas is my favorite professor on Wright State's campus. It warms my heart to know that some professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed. I will be taking classes with Dr. Thomas every time my schedule allows it. :: Dr. Thomas has a good system of teaching and is a wonderful teacher. :: He was a great teacher. :: Thank you for making Statics enjoyable, and I hope that I can take another class of yours before I graduate. -Lucas S. :: He is a great professor. :: We need more professors like this. :: I think professor Thomas truly cares about his students learning and is a passionate professor. :: Dr. Thomas is a great Professor. :: Overall the class is grade, but he need to make the grading much easier. He is killing me when it comes to grading. 90% are coming from the exams. Also he is a reallly hard grader as well. :: It's been a pleasure. I hope that I'll be able to work with you again in the future. :: Scott Thomas is a great professor. :: will look for more classes he teaches in the future. :: He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He will go out of his way to ensure the students who reach out to him have a full understanding of the content. :: If you make the exams worth 20 points but only put two questions on it the chances of the class doing well will be slim. My problem would be that I would get one question right and the other wrong and it would dock me like 10-8 points and suddenly I have a D or F. Its a great class but for people who struggle with physic concepts, its demeaning when you get Ds on most of your exams. Extra credit is amazing but that doesn't reassure you as much. I rather have several little quizzes that are for extra credit but allow the professor to see where we stand in the class. :: Overall, I think he taught his class very well and made the class fun. :: no"
1298,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Scott Thomas is a very effective professor. His lecture is never boring and grading system is very fair. :: Dr. Thomas is the best professor I have had at Wright State University. He lectures really well and does more examples than he does notes. This helps learning which makes him very effective. :: Excellent Proffessor and course, I have taken many classes with this instructor and am never disappointed. :: Prof. Thomas is one of the best professors in WSU. In this course I learned a lot from him, his passionate with his subjects. :: Easily the best professor I've had ever. Very attentive, fair, and caring.

Lots of Respect. :: He was very excited about the topics, making the course more interesting for the students. This helped me grasp the concepts more. :: Dr. Thomas does a fantastic job with the material. He goes thoroughly through the theory and gives helpful examples. :: Very effective. Good examples/explanations, HW helped understanding. :: awesome af. :: 10/10. :: Scott Thomas is a very good professor. He goes over problems and conceptual example well and makes sure every student understands the material. Even with having a lot on his plate he makes time to help his students when asked. I would take Scott Thomas again in a heartbeat. :: good. :: Exceptional. I learn a lot in every Scott Thomas class. There is an appropriate amount of theory, examples, and application in lecture. It's (often) fair, and I know what is expected of me after every class, every week. Regardless of whatever grade I get in his class, I can walk away from it knowing that I know so much more than I did going into it, and I cannot say that about all my professors. It's not perfect, but it's close. If I had my way, I would have Dr. Thomas teach all my classes. If he reads this, I encourage him to never change the layout of his classes. :: Good. :: Scott is very effective. Tells you exactly what you need to know in a clear and entertaining way. :: Scott is one of the best professors I have had at this school. He provides any and all materials necessary. He is very fair in grading, and he teaches materials that are understanding. He is very organized and helpful. :: Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor.

Could have used that time more effectively. :: Mr. Thomas was a very effective instructor. I learned so much from him during this class. Mr. Thomas made the material fun and engaging. He would constantly have students participate and encourage them to ask questions. He was very clear on every thing did, if students had any problem with a topic, he would further explain it and let students know where they could find it in the text. :: Scott was very effective in describing difficult concepts. He was very fair and show many examples to help students better understand the course. :: Very Effective"
1299,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas follows the syllabus and evaluates our work based on the expectations described on the syllabus. :: The Syllabus is Scott Thomas's Bible. :: Yes. :: Yes absolutely. :: Yes. :: Yes. Homework was already assigned at the beginning of the course, dates for all of the exams were given from the start, and the syllabus remained the same through the entire course. :: Absolutely. The all-knowing, all-powerful syllabus is perfect in every way and is followed to the letter. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 10/10. :: Yes, he had every laid out in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and has stuck exactly to it all semester. :: yes. :: The grade is homework and exams with the potential of bonus points simply encourage attendance. I know what is expected of me at all times, and I know exactly what I'm supposed to know at the end of every class. That is not to say I know the material perfectly after every class, but just as important, I know what I don't know and can reinforce and ask questions if I need to. :: Yes. :: Yes, very fair. :: Yes. He graded very fairly and any points I missed, I knew exactly why. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas followed his course syllabus exactly. :: Yes, very fair grader. :: Yes. :: He evaluated work as described in the syllabus to a tee. :: The instructor evaluated my work fair and reasonable amount of time. Scott did a great job in following the syllabus he gave us. :: Yes"

Right on the button. :: 10:10 every day. :: Yes. :: yes yes yes. :: 10/10. :: He starts exactly when our class is scheduled and he takes the entire time always. :: yes. :: The class starts, as Scott says as he stares at an atomic clock, at ""10:10 exactly"". It always did. It ended exactly 55 minutes later. The class, in the best ways possible, was predictable. There was routine.  Keep that routine. :: Yes. :: Always ""10:10 exactly"". :: Yes. He would start class exactly at the time it was to be started, and went the full class period.

He is friendly and approachable and inviting to office hours. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas is one of the few professors that actually cares and wants us to learn the material. :: Always attentive to questions, seriously this guy is the best professor at this university hands down!. :: By solving the difficult problems and describe the hard concepts clearly. :: Really made sure we understood what was going on. Wanted us to ask questions and when we did he made sure we understood before continuing. No question was a stupid question and he always wanted to help. :: Explained concepts well. :: He assigned in class extra credit problems and worked with us to see where we were at in the material. If we were having a hard time grasping it, he took class time to go over it again. :: By making the class lectures interesting and giving real world examples. :: Available by email and during office hours, would answer questions as necessary during class. :: goofy and funny. :: 10/10 Uses real world scenarios to help demonstrate learning. :: He will answer any question along with do some research when he does not know. :: yes. :: He's the most personable professor I've had. He addresses students by name and takes whatever time is necessary to answer a question. If the answer isn't so clear and might take time to answer, Scott is ever-present on email. :: Yes. :: Yes, Scott is always willing to help. :: He would make the material interesting. He also would stop frequently to make sure we understood the concepts. He teaches in a very high spirit so the class is enjoyable. :: Dr. Thomas would pause numerous times through lecture to allow for questions and if a question did arise he would stop lecture and explain the concept for however long he had to until it made sense to the student. He also allowed for in-class work that allowed for the students to work through a problem together and ask questions along the way make sure the students are understanding the material. :: Encouraged students to come to office hours, gladly answered any questions during class and after class. :: He encouraged questions and gave real life examples of in-class topics at least weekly.

Explanations were clear and helpful. :: awesomely. :: 10/10. :: he is very good at communicating in and outside of class. he is very good about responding to emails and will take the time in class to make sure the student understands the topic they asked about. :: yes. :: Better than any professor in the CECS at WSU. That's a fact. Class lectures weren't so upper level that they couldn't be understood. Many professors miss the mark by essentially wasting hours of class time on theory and derivation. As I said, there is an appropriate time spent doing this in Scott's class. I've had him for 55 minute classes (such as this class) and for 80 minute classes. Time is never wasted. :: Very good. :: Great communication. :: He communicated greatly in class, he would answer and questions or concerns. :: Dr. Thomas was very effective in his communication to the class about exam material, homework due dates, and etc. :: Very effectively, outside of the classroom via email. :: Mr. Thomas was very effective at communicating.

He sticks to his schedule and meters out the class to get done with the material in time. The ""all powerful"" syllabus (as he calls it) was accurate every day. :: Yes. :: Very organized. :: Yes. We followed the syllabus to the tee. He would start class on time, and cover the material as written. :: Yes, the lectures were very well organized and easy to follow. :: Yes, never deviated from the syllabus. :: Yes. :: They were very well organized.

The books he uses are followed well enough that they can referenced. Additionally, every problem is available online with a solution. I will never know why professors are against this approach. People learn this material by seeing it executed. This is one of the biggest learning aids in his classes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never had to contact Scott outside of class, but I know he will meet with students whenever needed, and he has responded promptly to my emails in the past. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas was available during office and if he was unavailable contacting him via email was a good option because he got back with you in a short period of time. :: Always available during walk-in office hours, and responded to emails quickly. :: Didn't need to, he did well enough in class and with the supplemental material on Pilot. :: Mr. Thomas was very reasonably available. :: Scott was available and responsive to any needs during office hours and email. :: Yes"
1305,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is an amazing professor. I wish more professors would teach the way he does and cares about teaching. :: Scott needs to teach a class about how to teach, where all other professors are the students. I learned a lot, I loved the class, and I would recommend Scott in a heart beat. :: No. :: One of my personal favorite professors in the ME department. He genuinely wants you to succeed in his classes. :: No. :: No further comments. :: You're a beast scott. keep up the good work. :: Scott does an awesome job! Keep up the good work!. :: He is a great professor and would recommend my peers to take him. :: yes. :: I don't agree with the exam blue book policy. In a class that stresses fairness, the idea that a student that didn't study can simply move the weight to the final really puts students who did study as a disadvantage. Not turning in the blue book skews the average and eliminates any potential for a curve.  It's also evident that difficulty of exam questions are based on the class's exam average. If the exam average is high on exam 1, students can predict there being a much-harder-than-normal problem on exam 2. It doesn't help that students not turning in a blue book can influence the next exam by skewing test averages. Not entirely fair, Dr. Thomas. Other than that, Dr. Thomas should teach a class about teaching, teach it in his style, and WSU needs to force all CECS professors to attend it. :: Professor Thomas is good with utilizing class time efficiently. He ran through practice problems for most of the class time which I feel is very effective when trying to learn this type of material. The only critique would be that he sort of assumed that everyone was on the same level and covered the same material in Thermo 1 since he taught that as well. So it wouldâve been nice if we couldâve reviewed the key concepts in the beginning more thoroughly. :: Scott is a great professor and I enjoyed having this course with him. I hope he doesn't change. Probably my favorite teacher. :: Dr. Thomas is a great professor and cares deeply for his students making sure they understand the material and have fun learning. :: One of the best professors I have had throughout my college career, who actually cares about his students. :: I very much enjoyed having him as an instructor and I cannot wait to have him again. :: I enjoyed the class and material presented by Scott. He did a great job and kept the classroom involved with humor. I believe that the jokes that Scott told the class help the class pay attention in class."
1306,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Instructor was helpful, but the course seem unorganized. I would also like to see more examples of practical application. :: Dr. Mian is effective. :: good. :: Was helpful and much improved from last time I had him gave lots of examples. :: He is a nice guy. :: Dr. Mian was very effective is conveying the information we needed. If there were any questions, he would try his best to provide an answer. Also has a great attitude. :: He was a very good teacher in office hours when attended, but the class was a little scattered after the first couple weeks. :: Moves through content very fast and it is easy to get lost during the lectures. :: good. :: Pretty good, sometimes was hard to follow. :: The homeworks were challenging specially when requiring simulink coding. :: he is the best. :: Confusing lectures, but very nice guy. Always willing to help and explain again and again. :: he is a good instructor. :: he was very knowledgeable about the material. :: Good. :: Dr. Mian taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: very good professor. :: Very effective`. :: Dr. Mian is thorough and more than willing to double back on a concept and reinforce it through examples and more lecture material if he suspects the class doesn't understand. His course and teaching style is easy to follow. :: Great. :: Not very effective, he made a lot of mistakes during lecture which made the subject matter more confusing than it needed to be. :: Good guy. He tries to make things clear and makes classes fun. He's not as organized as I wish he were, but he provides most notes online which is helpful. His exams are straightforward and he tailors examples to it. He understands that students have a hard time learning the material and he tries to give credit where he can to help. :: He did ok but there was room for improvement. He needed to do problems from start to finish and make sure to have solutions and not get mixed up halfway through the problems. He always did what he thought was the ""hard part"" and let us do the rest on our own. Sometimes this was difficult if we didn't know how to finish the problem."
1307,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. I think.?. :: He followed his syllabus appropriately. :: Yes, he based everything off the syllabus. :: Yes, the syllabus was well defined and strictly followed. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes!. :: yes. :: Yes, everything was as expected. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1308,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He was there on time everyday and used every second of the period, sometimes even more time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes always. He'd even go over sometimes which could be annoying but that showed he cared more about teaching the material than escaping the moment he could. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, we used the full class period. This probably shouldn't be a 3-day, 50 minute course as the material is comprehensive and it doesn't leave much time for example problems following a topic. That's not Dr. Mian's fault, just a comment to administrators and course planners. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1309,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Made sure to stop class and check to see if everyone understood the information. :: Yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: He answered questions when asked. :: He was always willing to answer questions. :: He was interested in our learning by stopping the class periodically to make sure no students had a question about the material being presented. :: . :: average. :: By bringing in speakers to teach us about real world applications and proving that ME's will always be needed. :: yes. :: good. :: Willing to extend class, make extra office hours, go at the pace of the students instead of leaving everyone behind. He would always pause to make sure we understand. Most teachers just teach without getting feedback, or even if they do, they just keep going and say ""keep up."" Not Dr. Mian. If the class is struggling, he'll stop and explain to the best of his ability. :: he explained everything well. :: he showed ways to use simulink that i never thought of. :: By showing up. :: Dr. Mian had us work on examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: giving quizzes an homework. :: answered question when i went to his office hours. :: The guest speakers and commentary on applications of the classwork were both greatly appreciated. :: Yes. :: He always encouraged students to ask questions, but did not necessarily answer them when asked via email. :: Yes."
1310,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Had available office hours and was quick to respond to emails. :: Dr Mian communicates effectively. :: good. :: Yes. :: well. :: Very well inside and outside through email. :: He was a little scattered in class because he would not use his notes and get lost in a problem or conduct the solution incorrectly. Out of class he communicated very well. :: He wouldn't tell you class information till the last minute. :: very accessible at all times. :: Very well. :: good. :: very well, always available if needed. :: Very well. Responsive with emails and questions. :: the homework were very useful and related to what we take in the class room. :: he was very flexible. :: Well. :: Dr. Mian used both email and Pilot to communicate well. :: very good. :: effecitvely. :: I appreciated getting an email notification when important material was uploaded, it helps. :: Good. :: Somewhat effectively. :: Well. :: He did not communicate super well. I talked to him in office hours about a group project and he said to email the details and he would take a look at it. I emailed him and never got a response. I then approached him in class and asked about it. He said he would take a look at it the next day. He never responded to the questions and caused me to submit a project that wasn't complete. I had originally asked him about it 1.5 weeks before the project was due and never got a response."
1311,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I don't think the course was organized well. The information didn't seem relevant to engineering so I would like to see more practical application examples in the future. :: Sometimes seems to wonder. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. :: The lectures were organized very well. However, I feel like there was a disconnect between the homework and the lectures. At times it felt like the book was asking for different things than what was described in class. :: No the class was very disorganized after the first four weeks of class. :: YEs. :: yes. :: Could have been a little more structure in the notes, sometimes was hard to follow from the powerpoint/online notes and what was done on the board. :: nice. :: yes. :: Not exactly. He jumps around a lot and can be difficult to follow. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not bad. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Very well organized. :: Yes. :: No, class was sort of all over the place most of the time, with no specific goal for any given class, which is why I believe we were running behind based on what the syllabus said. :: Not great, but not the worst. :: No."
1312,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: He was always available to help. :: . :: yes. :: Yes. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: I did not attend office hours or need anything additional. :: Yes. :: The only time I emailed him, he did not respond, but it was not an extremely important email. :: Yes, always. :: NO"
1313,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I would recommend this professor. He was helpful and engaged with the course. The course structure needs improvement, though. :: I would have preferred a review session on the last day as opposed to guest speakers. The guest speakers were interesting and informative however, they would have been better placed earlier in the schedule so that the last lecture could have been a review. :: No. :: d. :: I have no idea why I had to take this class. it seems completely useless although the same can be said for many of our required classes the methods used are out dated and this is suppose to prepare us for the reel world though it seems to be preparing us for the job market of 1950. :: Excited to take vibrations with Dr. Mian. :: no. :: nope. :: he is the best one. :: One of the most caring professors I've had. He may be hard to follow and understand, but his caring for his students makes up for it. He'll do anything to help us understand. :: no thank you. :: No. :: no additional comments. :: Overall positive experience, would take this instructor again any time. :: Did not learn much in this class, it involves a lot of self teaching. I believe the course could be much better organized, and that the lectures and material discussed during lecture could be a lot more clear."
1314,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. :: Well informed and available. :: Professor exhibits poor effectiveness. Offers no substance for the course and often times seems clueless. :: He is a great professor. :: good. :: Terrible. This is the fourth semester I've had Mian and the third class. He's an awful professor. Nice guy, I don't have anything against him personally. I've never received a bad grade from him or anything like that. He's just awful. He was often late for class. The first day of Capstone 1 he didn't show up claiming he thought the class started at 7:35pm rather than 7:35am. And this is the man in charge of my education. He was the most unorganized professor I've ever had to deal with, taking 5-10 minutes to set up for class, and keep in mind this was after he was late. Can't teach to save his life. Learned and retained very little information. I had him for Mechanics of Materials and because he didn't teach that very well my Mechanical Design 1 professor had to take time to teach us his material. Had him for System Dynamics and that was the biggest waste of time. The material is worth knowing but I didn't learn any of it thanks to him. Oh but I got a B in the class. He doesn't care if we learn, he just wants to give us the grade and go home. :: yes. :: He did a good job of making sure everyone was on track with their projects. :: His being there is pointless. :: Reasonably effective. :: good. :: very kind professor, good communicated with the students. :: good. :: He is a good instructor, but he needs to work on telling the students when deadlines are and when presentations will actually happen. As students, we spent a lot of time in the dark on when things were due and when to pick up notebooks. The times he listed were not always correct and sometimes he forgot to say anything at all. Now that being said, he did acknowledge his mistakes when he made them and tried to correct the ones he could. :: Gets off of track very easily. :: Very good. :: He is so effective. :: Very good. :: Dr. Mian was an effective professor throughout this course. :: he always available to answer any of the student considerations. :: Average. :: Dr. Mian would often wait too long to give us information we needed. He wasn't very helpful as far as providing necessary information. :: Very effective. :: he is perfect instructor"
1315,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I have no idea. :: yes. :: I don't know, it was extremely rare to receive any feedback from the instructor of this course. :: Instructor changed things up a number of times during the course to the point where things were run off of email and not the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He graded as if he didn't even read any of our stuff. We handed in our proposal in the middle of the Capstone 1 hoping for feedback so we could have a better final draft. His feedback was ""Looks good"". Not helpful. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he has evaluated our work based on expectations in the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he did"
1316,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: On occasion. :: Yes. :: for the most part. :: No. :: Sometimes, he would e-mail everyone to let us know that class would be starting earlier or later than planned, or would be cancelled.  It was often confusing, but at least he lets us know ahead of time. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: No. He showed up late. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes the class usually started on time and the full class period was used. :: yes 7:30 am every morning. :: no. :: No. He would often start class late, or cancel. We did use the full period most days though. :: Yes. :: yes , he did"
1317,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he wanted to know how things were going with the project. :: The instructor would ask us if we needed help with our projects. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He didn't, especially not in this class. :: He once looked over some work I did to make sure I was doing it right, and he gave me some suggestions on how to improve it. :: He met with us to discuss project progress. :: Honestly, I feel like a lot of Capstone doesn't need to be taught in a classroom setting. I feel it can be learned outside of class and maybe the students understanding of the content can be evaluated in other ways like proctored quizzes. :: -. :: laughing and many interesting things. :: he made sure we doing what we were suppose to. :: Yes he did, he found individuals to come speak with us about topics that we will run into in the work force. :: Meetings a couple of times though out the semester. :: Held meetings to make sure we understood what was happening and that everything was okay. :: Yes. :: For this course he brought in speakers to talk about our senior design projects and other topics that were interesting. :: well he always available to answer any mechanical related questions. i always go to his office with questions that sometime lead the conversation into another conversation full of useful information. :: set  up regular meetings with our group. :: He met with us each week to make sure we understood what we were learning. He would often ask us questions to make sure we understood the task. :: Periodic meetings outside of class time to check on individual teams progress and help if he was able to. :: he create good stuff to make us learn"
1318,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Semi effectively. :: well spoken. :: Emails were last minute and very poorly times. It was very frustrating. :: Yes.  He communicated well. :: good. :: Pretty awful. Often times we had to email him asking a question that should've been answered weeks prior. We missed or nearly missed a lot of deadlines because either it wasn't on the syllabus or he didn't tell us about them. And while we're on the subject of the syllabus, it might as well not exist. He picks and chooses when he wants to follow it. :: He did a great job communicating. :: Well enough to get the important dates across. :: Well enough. :: good. :: like to hear and listen from all the students. :: good. :: Well, minus when he forgot to tell us due dates. :: Did not answer emails back in a timely manor. Gave due dates the day of with no warnings. :: The emails he sent were a bit on short notice sometimes. For example, at 8am one day he said that notebooks were due at 9 but myself and a few other classmates were already at work. :: yes. :: He was somewhat effective communicating in and out of the classroom. Sometimes he was too vague which did not help us when we needed specific information. :: in class he never skipped any student question, and in emails he always have a quick response if the question sent to him before 11 pm. :: average. :: He would provide emails to let us know of upcoming events or schedules. He would answer questions in class. :: Very effectively. :: very good"
1319,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not really. :: yes. :: No, everything was scatterbrained and poorly structured. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Absolutely not. I'm often very confused about where he's going with something or how he got to where he is in the lecture. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Overall he was relatively organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. There were not many materials covered. This is because it is a capstone class, but anything he taught seemed to be put together last minute. :: Yes. :: yes"
1320,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I suppose. :: yes. :: Instructor had the worst times to pick up notebooks and submit. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 6 out of 10. Not great but could be a lot worse. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. He took a long time to answer any questions and was not available out of office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was available during office hours and was willing to schedule appointments if we needed help.,. :: yes always. :: I suppose. :: He often would be in his office when needed and would answer questions or provide necessary feedback. :: Yes. :: yes always"
1321,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Mian is new to teaching capstone. Our class had no idea what was really expected of us and hopefully this has given him the experience needed for his next capstone course. :: Dr. Mian is another professor in the ME department that should not be teaching. Every class I have had with him has been a waste of my time and money. As long as he remains teaching core classes, WSU ME students will be cheated out of education and money. :: no. :: Start caring about our education. It will help a lot of students out if he actually taught the material versus whatever it is he does now. Get more organized, please. Again, I've never had any personal issues with Mian. I think he's a nice guy. But he can't teach in any way shape or form and he's the worst professor I've ever had. :: No. :: great professor. :: no. :: no. :: Need to give documents sooner then the night before an assignment is due. Also give due dates sooner then what was given. Never any time to plan around work. Most students taking this course are in internships and work on a regular basis. :: Nope. :: yes. :: No. :: i took 4 classes with him and by far he is the best professor. :: Mian is a good guy, but not the best instructor. This is his first semester teaching this class, so it might have been hard for him to make it as good as it could've been. :: No. :: thanks Dr. it is pleasure to take class with you"
1322,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was overall fairly effective, though some explanations could afford to be clearer. :: He is a good professor. :: explained information in good detail for both the hw and quiz's to be done in a simple matter. :: He did a good job at making the course content easy to understand, and he also answered questions.  This made the class easy for me. :: It was alright. :: Great professor - Subject could be taught with great efficiency if it was not a split level course. :: Dr. Bae is a good teacher.  I feel like he conveys information very well. :: Ha-Rok Bae is not the most effective professor I've had in my college career. Often the only usable notes I have are the example problems we do in class and even then, they are cryptic. Most of the knowledge I gained in the class came from the text and my own personal research. :: Dr. Bae was very effective in teaching this class. He provided summary notes, that were very helpful, in addition to showing multiple ways to solve a problem. The only drawback was that the material is very repetitive which leads to some tuning out during lecture. I think some more classworks would have been able to prevent that. :: Overall pretty effective. He does this annoying thing where he writes on the board on top of stuff he's already written, and it's very hard to follow. His writing is also not the greatest. If he turned on the lights by the chalkboard it would be easier to see too, but mainly I wish he'd erase the whiteboard. :: Very effective instructor. Broke down the material to be extremely simple and understandable. :: he is very good at teaching the material. he is very experienced and knowledgeable. :: Ha Rok Bae was a very effective instructor. :: Dr. Bae taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: He tries to explain things thoroughly, which is appreciated, and goes over examples.  He starts class without warning and gets upset that we haven't started listening even though no one realizes he's started. He does not offer his extra credit fairly - he only allowed 10 people extra credit which brings everyone else's extra credit average down. (But at least we get a chance at extra credit) He does not teach towards his exams and its hard to be prepared for his exams because the homework isn't similar to the exam and he keeps changing the structure of his exams so you can never get used to it. He has a very strict partial credit scale that does not allow for ANY mistakes. :: Dr. Bae is lazy. :: The instructor seemed to know the material very well. One issue was that he used a lot of MATLAB and WOLFRAMATICA in class to solve some of the problems. This was not terrible because we could use them for the homeworks, but they were not available on the exam. This made it difficult to know how to do some of the exam problems by hand because we learned them on software that we couldn't use for the exams. :: Dr. Bae is very enthusiastic about the course material and about teaching it to others. He strives to make sure everyone understands the underlying basic principles and general procedures before diving into the theory and derivation of the complex topics covered. Dr. Bae's approachability helped me to grasp the concepts and ask him questions after class when I didn't quite understand something in the textbook or homework. :: Not effective in the slightest. Had unreasonable expectations for graduate students compared to undergraduate students. :: i. :: Very Poor. :: The classes were poorly organized. The lectures were spratic and it was next to impossible to follow his notes on the board. In addition he would have 3 sets of notes on the projector and then jump all around the board with hard to read comments. He would show the problems in matlab and mathmatica and then test us on how to do it by hand which we would not know how to do. He would often go over time and freeze the time on the board in an effort to make us think it was still 9:18. Overall very unimpressed with the class structure and lay out. :: Terrible. Learning had to be done via youtube tutorials. Was not available during office hours. Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. :: Very effective with use of plenty of examples and teaching strategies. :: Pretty good, I felt I learned a lot on finding the deflection, stress and reaction forces of structures. :: Dr.Bae is one of the most effective instructors. He is a knowledgeable person and have an excellent teaching skill. :: Finite element analysis is one of the core subject for mechanical designing.  Dr. Bae has taught this course very effectively.  Ease in understanding the subject and demonstrated the subject better. He has given a detailed explanation of each and every other topic and made it more specific by teaching several related examples. :: Overall Dr Bae is good instructor but its hard to get excellent grades in his course, beacuse exams are harder compared to others. :: Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly. :: Effectiveness is normal. not good, not bad. we get only theoretical knowledge which is available in textbook also. :: pros Very Professional in work ethic cons solves few problems, cannot understand matter completely, boring, lack of examples, tough paper and tough grader, lots of homework, information can be improved. :: sometimes it gets difficult to pay attention in class. It gets monotonous and boring, the professor has no trick to gather students attention or keep them involved. :: One of the best professors who has taught me. I had a very good time listening to his valuable lectures."
1323,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes,. :: Yes, generally, but I also think that his homework grading was a little bit harsh.  We often had to use the book to figure out how to complete the problems, and often from poorly worded questions on the book's part.  The book was not very good overall, so it was never any surprise when I didn't get a homework question correct.  Also, the feedback on the homework was usually very vague and unhelpful. :: Yes, Ha-Rok Bae evluated the work we did based on the concepts and principals of FEA. :: Yes he followed his syllabus closely in addition to providing a rubric for the project. He also went over what he looks for in his exams (albeit after the exam). :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He evaluated us based on his very flawed grading scale. The work was relevant to the subject, but did little to prepare us for the exam. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I believe that he evaluated my work based upon the expectations described in the course syllabus. The grading was fair and he offered plenty of opportunities for extra credit (on the exams)  and bonus work (in class). :: Instructor offered very little partial credit on exams. ""All or nothing"" grading style. :: Very unclear on what is expected. Always felt he wanted to hide what was expected so students will do bad. Did not care as much of student learning as he did about his own work. :: He did not give partial credit. Hes grading seemed quite inconsistent. As a grad student you might as well just take 20 points off at the beginning because the graduate problems were either tricks or never covered in class. :: No. Grading was 10, 5, or 0.  Mistakes in part A took off points in parts B-G in a problem worth 50% of the grade. The graduate curve was calculated from undergrad grades that have 30+pts of extra credit. :: Yes, course guidelines were followed correctly and understood at beginning of semester. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae organised the mid terms exams really well. He made sure he covered all the topics during the examination and used to evaluate the written work properly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes, but tough in grading. :: Yes. :: Yes, the evaluation was as expected."
1324,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes used all the class period every meeting time. :: Yes. :: Time was used effectively in the class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he was way to accurate when it came to time. :: Yes, class always started on time, and went right up to and even slightly over time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He started class exactly when the clock struck 8:00 pm. He would normally start writing on the white-boards and the class of 60+ people would begin to quiet down. Dr. Bae used the full class period (8:00pm - 9:20 pm) to teach the material. :: Yes. :: Always starts on time, often times would just start teaching without any notice and very quietly. Many times held us over the end of class and was very unclear on when class ended. :: Started on time and often went over. :: No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was always on time and used full class period and made a very good effectiveness on the subject. :: sharp on the time. :: Yes he is very accurate in time. :: yes, this is good thing in instructor. very punctual. :: Yes, very punctual. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was spot on."
1325,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Involvement of the class in working examples. :: Yes. :: showed ways of solving problems in matlab or mathmattica to help show it can be down by both hand and computer. :: He did a great job at answered everyone's questions. :: Matlab. :: Yes, frequently asked for input and proof of understanding. :: He was very good at taking the time to make sure we knew what was going on and generally understood the material. :: Ha-Rok used real world examples based off of typical entry level positions in the engineering to explain to us how the concepts of FEA would be important in our field. :: He showed us how to generate a matlab outline to speed up the homework process. :: He was always willing to help when I would ask him questions after class or email him. He was even nice enough to look at a MATLAB code I'd done and check it for errors, which is tedious to do. I appreciated that. :: Would provide extra material outside of the class for further study. Would always stop to make sure everyone understood the lecture. :: he made sure i understood what the course talked about and how other courses contributed to it. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae would have us work out examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: No. :: Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well. :: Limited interest in student learning. :: Class itself seemed very interesting, however he never truly explained the content or material  but rather showed a matlab code on how the problem was done. Students were not allowed to use matlab on exams so many classes were spent wasting time on matlab code. :: No. :: No, was not available during posted office hours. :: By relating problems solved in class to how the FEA software directly uses the math in real world. :: Answered questions in class, used Matlab to work out problems and Mathematica for derivations. Made code used in class available for use to experiment with. :: Dr.Bae uses his experience while solving problems he applies the formulas to actual real world problems and teaches the approach to solve them. Which makes everyone to focus on his lecture. :: Dr. Bae has provided labs regularly for having a practical demonstration on this subject and also made us choose our own project and work on it for better understanding of the subject which had made me gain more interest in this subject. :: Yes. :: Shows interest to share knowledge to us. :: just asked the question that, is there any question. ? and nothing else. :: not very much. :: Not at all. :: Dr. Bae was interconnecting practicality with the concepts being taught. In that sense, he gave sufficient examples to correlate the theory concepts with real life."
1326,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication was usually effective, with occasional confusion. :: Yes. :: fair. :: Good. :: Alright. :: communication was open and easy fast responses and flexibly availability. :: Yes, very much so. :: Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hours and would answer questions to the best of his ability in class. :: N/a. :: Very well. :: Very effectively. :: he was very flexible with office hours and email. :: ok. :: Dr. Bae used email and Pilot to communicate with us well. :: The professor would hide away in his office when I try to contact him. :: Good. :: Dr. Bae used Pilot News to assign homework problems. It would have been nice to have an inclass announcement during the day when he posted them. I learned to check Pilot just before class time so that I would not miss a posting. Dr. Bae communicated effectively inside the classroom. Unfortunately, I felt the class room was a bit large. His hand writting on the fourth white-board was sometimes hard to read when I was sitting on the side of the first whiteboard. Despite this challenge, Dr. Bae was always willing and able to tell us what he wrote down if we could not clearly see it from where we were sitting. :: Not helpful during office hours. Often made mistakes during lecture. :: very poorly. I did not do well on the first exam but after going over it i felt i did not receive much partial credit especially for a class that is very partial credit heavy in terms on content. Basically a sign mistake or an error in calculations gets only half credit and any mistake after that will get you no credit. Every problem was double and triple penalized for the same mistake many times.  When i tried to get help a couple times he was in his office, he would shut the lights off and even though I knocked on the door he did not answer. As I walked away, he turned his lights back on and even came out of his office to throw something away. When I walked back to his office because I clearly saw him walk back, his lights shut off again and he didn't answer when I knocked. :: His office hours were after the class 930-1030 at night and it was difficult to find time outside of that for consolation. He was very unclear with his instructions (cribsheet size for example). He also was quite confusing trying to explain the course content. I believe he understood the material well but struggled communicating it with the class in a way they could understand. :: Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. Notes were illegible, both in lecture and online.  Learning was done by looking at another teacher's notes, the book, or outside sources. :: Very well through use of email and pilot. :: Pretty good, homeworks were posted on Pilot, everything else was available through Pilot. :: Dr.Bae is professional and punctual. He always clarifies the doubts of any student in the class,he explains it to everyone. Outside the class he helps in understanding and how to approach certain problem students canât solve. He is a great help. :: Ease in understanding the subject, demonstrated each and every other topic . Clarified doubts even during the office hours and also during additional appointment hours. :: Fairly good. :: In class communication is better as compared to out of class. :: communication is moderate. :: Not very approachable. :: Too technical and a bit difficult to understand. :: Dr. Bae was pretty much effective in communicating the concepts both in and out of the classroom."
1327,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Course content was overall well organized, though technical issues occasionally occurred. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Could probably be a little more refined. :: Content was organized but too in depth for undergrad. A lot of focus on the backgrounds and proofs of why more geared towards the grad level. This caused a lot of needed application time and examples needed to be sacrificed. :: Generally the lectures seemed a bit scattered.  This is mostly due to the fact that Dr. Bae uses pre-written notes on a projector, which makes it hard to copy down and allows him to go back and reference earlier parts while adding new material.  In other words, he jumped around the notes a lot, which made it had to copy into our notebook.  Also, the use of MATLAB in order to solve the problems was typically unhelpful to my understanding.  I would have rather spent the time it took to write the scripts in class actually working through a problem by hand to completion, even if that means that some of the matrix addition had to be skipped due to time constraints.  This material is generally very systematic, which means that if we see the process a few times it should be satisfactory.  But writing a script just made it seem more convoluted. :: The material in the lecture did not line up with the lab at all, which made it seem like we were taking two totally seperate classes. :: Yes. :: Some content would have made more sense in a different order, the best example being the final lecture on software FEA techniques which would have been very helpful prior to completing the term project but was only given after the due date. :: Yes except for the writing on top of other stuff on the board thing. :: Yes. :: yes. :: the content and lectures were well organized. :: Yes. :: Vaguely. He went off of his past notes, which were available online. That was very helpful. Honestly, if he put up his notes and examples THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAM, then I wouldn't have a problem with the class at all. :: No. :: It was a little bit difficult to follow sometimes when we jumped around in chapters but otherwise it was ok. :: Yes. I felt the material was well organized. I was a little confused as to why the chapter organization started out as 1, 2, 16, 17, 18, but it was much clearer by the time I finished the class. I now know that the lecture was organized this way to make the theory in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 much easier to understand. The textbook is organized in such a way that allows instructors to adapt the material to fit their curriculum needs. :: Course content seemed to be all over the place. Was not comprehensive. :: Very unorganized. Often times didn't bring his notes and he would ask a student where class ended previously. :: no. :: No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well. :: Yes, Dr. Bae took his time and made us have a better understanding in every other topic taught. :: Yes. :: Yes it is well organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1328,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I have no information on this topic. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I don't know.  I never had to go to his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hour appointments. :: N/a. :: Yes, although office hours only being offered after class ended (9:30 PM) made utilizing them difficult. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. I would try to ask questions and he said he wouldn't help me. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well. He was also available during office hours or by appointment as needed. :: No, instructor had limited office hours that were at unreasonable times. :: very bad. This was explained earlier in the ""How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?"" I am doing bad in this class due to the lack of partial credit. I do not believe my grades on exams are a fair representation of my understanding of the material.  It is ridiculous to not give partial credit or put the learning of the student before own needs. :: no. :: No, was not available during posted office hours. :: Yes, office hours were directly after class. :: Yes. :: He is mostly available to students. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was available during in office hours and he also use to make time to be available during non office hours. :: Yes. :: He is available at office hours and appointments. :: they are available on line (emails). office hours were difficult to communicate. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1329,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Usage of pilot could be more effective. The Course syllabus, lab schedule, and the only existing link to the project guidelines were posted in the news feed only.  Homework was posted in this news feed, but this news feed does not display on the pilot homepage, nor does it update the course calendar on pilot with due dates, making sorting out due dates a challenge occasionally. :: The FEA project could have been a little different.  I think maybe we should have been given a part to analysis without the directions and then do the analysis ourselves to get the right answers. It took a long time to figure this out for the project since we were never really taught how to use the software, because the labs were just follow the instructions to get the right answers. :: nope. :: Need more examples hand done like the exams will be. more so than the Mat Lab to save time. Proofs and theory can be read in the book and spending great time explain why it works is less helpful then showing how it works. :: Dr. Bae is one of my favorite teachers at Wright State.  He's very nice and very intelligent.  He really seems to care about teaching students and he does a good job with tough material. :: I would like to see more use of the text in class, that way we have some reference to come back to if we get confused while studying. :: I am sad that he is not teaching vibrations next semester. :: Would have preferred if the notes on Pilot were more complete. I attended every class and took what I thought were adequate notes but techniques taught in class were not always the same as those in the textbook and the inability to go back and look at the material that we went over in class made some sections difficult. A more full set of online notes existed, they were shown in classes, but were not posted to Pilot. The lab syllabus was mentioned repeatedly, but there apparently was no lab syllabus. This was confusing. :: He was funny!. :: no. :: Poor. Ineffective teacher. Please remove him. :: I would recommend Dr. Bae for future classes. :: Offer more partial credit on exams. Too harsh on graduate students compared to undergraduate. :: Another unfortunate situation is due to the shortage of classes if anyone fails this class this semester they cannot retake it until fall of 2018. So if you are supposed to graduate in Spring 2018 your graduation will be delayed 2 semesters for 1 class in which no partial credit or explanation for mistakes or help was given. This is not fair to the student. Many people will be affected due to this. He is also very unclear on the crib sheet and what is expected on exams. Often times I felt like he was trying to hide what he wanted just so students will do bad. :: The lab TA also could not communicate in clear English. A project worth 5% of the final grade was given with numerous grammatical errors. :: The labs were not as effective as I felt they could have been. I felt they were focused more on following directions rather than actually learning how to use the software. Many times I didn't know why I was doing something, I just knew that things would work if I did. I felt a lot more things could have been learned, such as element type selection, were left on the table because we had instructions to follow. This made the final project not very effective because I didn't understand the software. I felt the final project would have been better served to be set up like a lab but without the step by step instructions. I think that was basically how it was set up anyway but I'm not really sure.  I though the examples worked in class should have focuses more on running through the problem from step up to end. I felt like quantity of examples work took precedent over quality of examples worked. Using MAtlab to demonstrate problems didn't really help me because I couldn't have Matlab on the exams. If distributed loads was going to be such a big part of the second exam, I think we should have covered it better than we did. I had a total of page of notes of the subject and half of that was the background on the topic and some stuff we did in Matlab with it. We never covered distributed loads in local coordinate systems not aligned with the global coordinate systems and it wasn't in the book. I felt like that was a topic that was important enough to cover more extensively anyway, regardless of its involvement on the exam. Speaking of the exams, one side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet. I was limited on the exams because I could not fit everything necessary to complete the exam on the crib sheet. I can remember some of the more extensive matrices or equations so I would rely on the crib to do that for me but since I couldn't fit everything on there I was between a rock and a hard place. I don't understand why we had to be so limited. I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final since there is more material to cover. It just seemed ridiculous.  (I forgot to put this on my Mechanical Vibrations review but what were you thinking adding a homework assignment and making it due during finals week. Really? I don't know why you couldn't have made it like this class were the last homework assignment was posted with the answers for our review to help us on the final and not for a grade. Seemed completely unnecessary in my opinion). :: Dr.Bae gives a student friendly question with a very small twist. The only problem some students face during exam is they are unable complete all the answers in time even if they know how to solve the entire problems. :: No. :: For bonus questions in exams, he doesn't give half score even if answer is half correct. :: We get more difficult exam paper as expected. :: The exams question are too different than prof taught in lectures. I saw some questions that never faced in homeworks, classworks and in lectures. We never get any small kind of sample like such questions. exams were really hard and each question include many twists in it. Every question is tricky and something different that never imagined and experienced in practical and theorotical life. :: I'm glad to have a professor like him."
1330,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was average for the ME department. a lot of what you learn is taught through homework and examples so as long as you follow along then it should be fine. :: He is a good professor. :: He did a good job at explaining the course content, and he answered questions.  This made the class easy for me. :: Alright. :: Very effective lectures.  Good balance of theory and examples. :: i. :: Pretty effective. Seemed to get better the further we got into the course. :: Dr. Bae was a very effective instructor.  I was able to understand exactly when he was trying to emphasize some critical concept for the course.  He was able to relate the real engineering applications to the theoretical knowledge that he was teaching us.  It was very beneficial to me since I had completed my undergrad ME degree many years ago and have some experience with the engineering applications outside the classroom.  I think he presented the complex concepts in an effective manner that was easy to understand. :: Good instructer, but its hard to get good scores in his subject. :: Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly. :: normal. :: professional, lack of visual approach"
1331,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae followed the course syllabus very closely which was very helpful to me for planning. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: tough grader. :: Yes. But tests were more difficult and extensive than the material taught.
1332,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Since I am paying for my graduate degree out of pocket, I appreciated his efficient and prompt use of class time.  He was mindful of his timing and was very good at avoiding the spanning of complex material presentation across class periods. :: Yes. :: Yes he is very accurate in time. :: yes, very punctual. :: yes. :: Yes."
1333,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- a lot of times he mistook silence as understanding (not totally his fault) or had difficulty understanding why we may be confused on a topic. :: Yes. :: He did a good job at answering students' questions. :: Lab. :: Yes. :: Answered questions in class. Used animations to visually demonstrate how the formulas were working. :: He supported my learning by making himself available outside normal class periods to answer questions which was appreciated. :: He answer clearly our questions and doubts. :: Shows interest to share knowledge to us. :: no. :: no doesn't seem to care. :: None. The classes were monotonous and boring.
1334,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well enough. :: Yes. :: Good. :: Alright. :: Very well. :: Pretty good. Homeworks were posted on Pilot. :: He communicated promptly and effectively with me whenever I emailed him. :: fairly good. :: In class communication is better as compared to out of class. :: very few. :: not very approachable. :: Not at all. Difficult to understand.
1335,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Could be more refined. :: Very much so. :: Yes. :: The course was well organized except that we did not cover the last section on the course syllabus due to insufficient class time remaining.  It was related to design problems and I was looking forward to it.  This isn't really a negative comment towards Dr. Bae because he had to spend some extra in other sections but it would have been nice to cover.  I will be reading the design related sections on my own time after the course is over. :: Yes. :: Yes it is well organized. :: not so well. :: yes, but strict grader. :: Yes."
1336,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: I don't know.  I never had to go to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was very responsive,  I had no issues communicating with him during office hours and via email. :: Yes. :: He is available at office hours and appointments. :: available on line. :: yes. :: Yes."
1337,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- in class work is appreciated but some times students need more time to complete problems. :: I think the labs had nothing to do with the course. It was based on chapter 6 which was not covered in class and was considered an grad level section of the class. :: The labs were the most useless things I have ever seen. Did absolutely nothing to enhance my knowledge of the subject. I know you said that the labs can't always line up with what is taught in class (at least I think you said that, it might have been said in FEA I'm not entirely sure) but they weren't even close. I had no idea what was going on in the labs. We wasted time trying to collect data when ultimately we would normally be sent the data to use for the reports. The lab time would have been better used explaining how to analyze the data. Of course, it sounds like you were pretty hands off the labs, and didn't really know what was going on with them. So I don't know if it was the TA that was the problem, or the lab set up or what it was, but they were a complete waste of time in my opinion. I wish we would have worked through more examples start to finish in class instead of rushing through different parts of them. It seemed that quantity was valued over quality at times just to get more examples on the board. I would have appreciated it if you would have slowed down some and fully worked all aspects of the problems out to serve as a road map.  One side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet and I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final (I didn't mention this on my FEA review but this statement applies there as well). There was a lot of material covered in class. I was limited on my performance on the second exam not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because I couldn't fit all the necessary equations on my crib sheet and couldn't remember what it was. The crib sheet serves as a reference so we can focus on how to use the formulas and not on what the formulas are. There was a lot of formulas for the second exam and I can only write so small to try to fit them all on my crib sheet. On the topic of the second exam, I understand that the conceptual things are important, but it seemed kinda overkill to make them 70% of the exam when most of class time is spent on application. The exams should reflect what we are doing in class. I understand that a few questions are alright to make sure that we understand the basis why we do things, but 70% of the exam broken up into 10% chucks which are basically hit or miss didn't seem like the best way to test that. :: I appreciated his professionalism and depth of knowledge on the subject.  I look forward to signing up for other classes that he teaches. :: No. :: We get more difficult exam paper as expected. :: Concepts were not clear, too fast and exams were very tricky and twisting. each question is tricky."
1338,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not very effective at all. Constantly argued that he was right about every question until shown in the book he was wrong. Never helped students review or understand how to solve problems at the same level as the ones on his exams. :: Amir spends his lectures completely reading definitions from the textbook with little example problems. He does not do a good job preparing you for future related courses at all. :: Very good at explaining theory, but reads straight from the book for anything else. Lessons do not help with homework. :: I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class. I learned more from the book. He just writes things straight from the book he doesn't add or make learning any material from the book easier. :: Okay instructor. :: Yes, the instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. I am passing but, I have struggled in this course so far. In class we pretty much go through the chapter with very little examples which makes it hard when the homework is not conceptual questions only math problems which we hardly ever go over in class. The only reason that I am passing the class is because one of the three questions on exams is conceptual question which is weighted the most on exams. Need more examples in class and less conceptual notes. :: not effective at all. I probably have to take it again due to his class structure and test structure. None of the examples  from our homework assignments nor what was discussed in class were on the exams. :: didnt learn a thing. :: Dr. Farajian was not an effective professor. For most of the semester, he was showing up late to class anywhere between 2-15 minutes late. Our first exam we had, he was 15 minutes late and kicked us out of the room right at 4:30 which was our end time. During lecture, he did mostly theory and barely any examples. Our test grades were not that great because we had little experience with working problems. It wasn't until after our second exam when he finally listened to us and started doing more examples in class. Although his examples were always a problem he would have us work out of the book with our tables and give extra credit to the first table to answer. Most of them he wouldn't even go over how to do after someone answered. :: very poor, learned nothing from his lectures. :: bad. :: I didn't really understood him had to read the text book a lot to better understand the marital. :: Dr. Farajian has been the worst professor I have ever experienced. Class always started 5-10 minutes late everyday. His lectures consisted of scribbles of vaguely  summarized formulas from the textbook, and he also never worked through a single example problem during his lectures. The only problems that were discussed during class were worked through amongst our table ""groups"" with only a single answer stated by the professor. Dr. Farajian never once worked through solution to any problem for the duration of the course. these are just facts of what has happened. His demeanor was terrible. the professor came off as very arrogant and unapproachable. :: Dr. Amir Farajian is a very nice and intelligent professor. He understands the topic he teaches. Over all his form of teaching was not effective for myself or the class. The questions he asked where usually hard to understand and then answer. The other struggle facing his students was a clear expectation with the projects and the exams. The final problem I had was the projects we had before each exam. These projects where a good source of points, however, he was not clear on his expectations and when the projects was complete and turned in, it appeared he didn't read them; just used turn-it-in to evaluate the project. I am under the impression that this class is not supposed to be taught well as a sort of ""weed out class"". :: The instructor was ineffective in grading papers and getting them back.  Also, he rarely would respond to emails.  He was effective in his teaching. :: I thought this teacher did a very poor job teaching the material. :: When doing these course evaluation surveys I often go through them quite brief; However, Dr. Farajian's performance MUST be addressed in every manner and so I will do my best to fully explain my experience for every question.  For the overall effectiveness of this instructor: Dr. Amir Farajian has been the least effective instructor that I have had in my three years of college for engineering. I am not evaluating this decision based off of any personal emotion, but by comparison of other professors in my past experience. Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. Dr. Farajian did not have any plan laid out for the class and had no dates set for class assignments, quizzes, or even grade returns. His plan for lecture was to bring in a text book and go through/skip specific parts (he explained only as much material as the book did, rarely went into further detail). If questions were asked beyond the books material, the answer would be both scarce and questionable, almost hesitant. Almost all of the material handed into Dr. Farajian was never returned back to the students, which made it difficult to use for any further studying. As far as grades, students would not receive grades for an average of weeks. (Exams: 2 Weeks, HW: 2 Weeks, Quiz: 1 Week, Projects; 2.75 Weeks). :: His class time is well spent, easy to understand. :: After retaking this class with Dr. Farajian I don't believe I've learned anything new. In fact I feel as if I've lost knowledge from the previous spring semester. Lectures were dedicated to definitions instead of working through problems until 3/4s of the way through the semester when students went to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian to discuss concerns for the class. Only after that were examples done in class at a slightly increased frequency. I understand it's Dr. Farajians first time teaching this class, but I did not find the way class was conducted to be very effective at all. :: Dr. Farajian does a good job explaining the theory behind thermodynamics. :: He needs to be evaluated. He does not know how to teach at all. :: He knew the material well. However class time was not spent effectively. He showed up late to class for the majority of the semester. We never finished all the material we were supposed to cover. He did not give back graded exams. Students had to come during the thirty minute office hours to look at their exams and then hand them back over to the professor before leaving. The professor always kept the exams, even though it would have been more beneficial for students to get their exams back and see the solutions. He was very ineffective. :: He made sure that we knew the concepts. He also made us do projects that did not help us with our learning in any way. :: less effective than reading the notes from the book a classmate took while drunk. :: Anything Amir said or taught in class was 90% of the time just a paraphrased version of what was said in the book. Going to class was often no more helpful than simply skimming the material on my own time. :: no. :: Poor teacher, reads straight from the book and covers few examples.  Never covers how to use charts in thermo book properly.  Consistently late to class and canceled class multiple times, barley finished one chapter for the final section of the class which was supposed to cover 3 chapters."
1339,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- no. :: Yes. :: yes, grading was outlined well in the syllabus. :: His syllabus needed a grade scale and also for the projects a more descriptive rubric. :: Mostly. Group projects weren't clearly defined in the syllabus and no information about presentations/presentation grading was giving. Number of exams/projects/homework were mostly as expected. :: Yes. :: no h. :: yes, lenient. :: There were many things that he did not put in the syllabus that we were unaware of grading wise. For example, we had 3 projects we had to complete throughout the semester. Our first project was a disaster because the only thing in the syllabus was the requirements of the paper (i.e. single spaced, 12 point font, times new roman, and each table member had to write 2 pages.). There were no guidelines for our PowerPoint presentation that had to accompany the paper and we did not know how things were going to be graded. A lot of people didn't do well on the first project because we did not know what he was wanting and he refused to answer questions about it until after the first project was done. :: not at all. :: no. :: yes. :: the weight of the different types of work in the class are accurate but the professor did not execute the course well at all. :: He evaluated our work based off of loose expectations that were broadly misinterpreted. :: Yes. :: no. :: Dr. Farajian's syllabus was both limited and was not followed in certain areas. The biggest issue with the course syllabus, which I witnessed but did not encounter personally, was that the syllabus was very extensive; When students would bring up issues with how their projects were graded Dr. Farajian would use the syllabus and it's gaps in the instructions to support his grading marks. Although Dr. Farajian has the right to grade how he seems fit, I do not believe it is fair to the students to bend the syllabus after students have already completed the project and received a bad grade. :: yes. :: Yes, the course syllabus described the expectations for the course thoroughly. There were a few times in which we needed clarification for the expectations though. :: yes. :: His way of grading is beyond me. ive never seen anything like this class, its a joke. on our second project he told us we got 5% taken off because we didnt look prepared walking up to him. even though we answered every question he threw at us and confused him because he didnt even know what he was asking us. we recieved a 95% on that project i feel as though he was mad at our group because we out smarted him. :: Yes. The syllabus did not give much information. The instructor did not get through all the material that the syllabus said we should get through. :: The projects were not graded in the same way the syllabus explained. The grades were arbitrarily graded based on the originality report and the way we answered questions during our presentation. None was based on the technical content of the paper. :: no. :: Homework and exams were graded fairly, but Amir never gave us a syllabus for the projects, so the grade distribution for them was unnecessarily all over the map. :: Expectations were not clear for the first two midterms.  It would be helpful to have point values assigned on the exam for each question. :: no"
1340,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No. Was consistently 10-15 minutes late. :: Absolutely not. He was between 5-10 minutes late nearly every day. :: Was never on time to class. He showed up 15 min late for an exam. :: He has been on time once this semester. Other than that he was late everyday. :: Usually late to class and then had to take time to set up projectors beyond already being late, which took up a significant amount of time for a 55 min class. :: No, on multiply occasions he was anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes late, including on the day of our first exam. :: Has been 5-10 minutes late the whole semester only on time these last few weeks. :: definitely not. many many times class started more than 15 minutes late. He was actually 30 mins late to the first exam!!!. :: half the time 5 minutes late. :: I believe there were 3 classes total this semester that Dr. Farajian showed up to class on time. As stated above, he was almost always late to class. :: nope usually late. :: no always late. :: No was sometimes late to class. :: class was always 5-10 sometimes 15 minutes late and class time was poor utilized as well. :: yes. :: The teacher would show up around five minutes late most days. :: no he would usually come in late. :: Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. :: yes. :: Again, until about 3/4s of the way through the class he was nearly always late. Students even ended up guessing each day how late he would be that day. Even for our first exam he was 10 minutes late. Since speaking to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian, he did start coming pretty consistently on-time to class. :: yes. :: no, he was never on time I stopped counting after Thanksgiving but he was up to 170 min of being late. :: Almost never. There might have been 2-4 classes that he started on time. Towards the end of the semester he realized we would not get through all the material so he showed up on time to class. :: Quite often he was late by 10 minutes. He was even 10-15 minutes late to our first exam. :: he was late so often we would as a class we would each mark on the white board how late we thought he would be. He needs a new watch more than he needs to be replaced as the instructor of this class. :: At the very beginning and end of the semester, he would begin and end class on time, but during the bulk of the semester he would arrive 5 to 10 minutes after class was supposed to have started. Throughout the semester, regardless of whether or not he was on time, he often spent an unnecessary amount of time discussing semi-relevant information about the upcoming assignments. :: The first portion of the semester was rarely started on time (5-10 minutes late). This improved the second part of the semester. :: for most of the semester he was always late to class to the point the class started to bet what time he would come into class that day. :: NO, professor was almost never on time to class."
1341,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He didn't. :: No. Whenever you ask him a question, his answer would always lead up to him blaming you for not knowing the material. :: He was interested for the first few weeks of class, but became less and less concerned with how much we were actually learning. :: HE DIDN'T. He just came in wrote text straight from the book on the board. I would have been better off taking this course somewhere else like Sinclair. :: Extra credit opportunities that encouraged solving problems and answering questions in class. :: No he seemed to lecture only reading out of the book. :: didn't seem to care. just wanted to collect a paycheck. I'm disappointed I have spend my hard earned money for this instructor to teach me absolutely nothing. :: somewhat. :: He would always tell us we need to pay attention whenever someone was talking about an idea because ""it is all very interesting stuff"". He seemed to enjoy teaching the subject and always told us this is a great class for engineers but I am not too convinced he cared about our interest in the topic. :: very belittling. :: not good. :: By giving out projects. :: there was no interest in our learning. the professor was very unapproachable. :: There was more of an air of frustration in our learning than an interest in our learning. :: Yes, I believe he did.  He asked conceptual questions to test our understanding of the subject. :: no. :: From my observations and personal opinion, there was no interest in my learning. Many students, including myself, expressed our frustrations and concerns towards our experience in Dr. Farajian's class and they seemed to be almost disregarded. :: He tried to carry everyone along. :: He demonstrated interest in a strange way. During class he would ask us questions and try to get us to answer them. The issue was that his questions weren't clear so we had to keep guessing wrong until he further clarified what he was trying to get at. Unfortunately that was also true for our group projects and the lack of clarity ended up affecting our presentation grades. :: By listening to each individual groups presentations for projects three separate times throughout the semester. :: He would give you a sneary look if you asked a question then would say see me after class if he didnt know it. :: He told us what important concepts we needed to understand and posted homework solutions. :: He gave a lot of extra credit even though it was difficult to earn sometimes. :: He didn't. :: To his credit, he encouraged us to research somewhat obscure, unconventional topics for our projects. :: he didnt at time. :: Demonstrated zero interest in my learning."
1342,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Was very poor with communication and failed to answer any email with questions regarding the course or course material. :: His office 'half-hour' once a week is not nearly enough for the courses he is teaching. He refuses to hand back exams and says that to see our graded work that we need to go to his office, but there is almost always a line of people waiting, making it almost impossible to see him in time. :: He was not a fan of questions in class because it put him on the spot and would just say see me after class. :: He has an accent which is okay. But sometimes his accent drowns out what he's trying to get across so you just blank out. :: Occasionally had a condescending attitude towards students when speaking with students during class time and in office hours. Wasn't great at answering questions in class. Would often tell student who asked the question to speak to him after class when the question and answer would have benefited the whole class. :: very poorly. :: no comment. :: terrible. :: He never responded to emails. I had even been to his office to talk to him and I'll ask if he received my emails and he actually told me that he does not answer emails. He was always available in his office though to answer questions and I had been to see him a lot this semester. :: ok. :: terrible. :: exam schedule and location was shady and not upfront. emails were sometimes unresponsive. :: His communication was better one on one than in class. :: In the classroom, he did a good job of going through the material and was available after class to talk to.  Outside of class, I know students had problems with the instructor not responding to emails. :: Very poorly. :: There was very little communication between the class and Dr. Farajian. I believe that observing his communication with certain students who attempted to voice their questions or concerns forced students to keep their questions to themselves, which in return killed the class participation. :: good communication. :: Email is probably the worst form of communication to use with Dr. Farajian. Getting a response was very difficult. However, if you went to his office hours he was much more responsive to your questions and concerns. :: He did fine. :: horribly, very often said there was homework but then wouldnt post it in time so he had to extend it. :: He mostly communicated verbally in the classroom. His communication was not bad. He did keep changing dates for assignments though. :: He communicated pretty well out of class other than the one time he waited until part way through the day to cancel class. :: He was vague and cryptic describing the requirements for projects and insisted that any misunderstanding was the fault of the students. :: He did as well as anyone else reading straight from a textbook. :: No response to emails. :: not very well"
1343,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- no. :: As I said before, his lectures are all just repeated information from the textbook. :: He read and taught straight from the book so yes they were organized. :: Nothing was well organized. :: Yes, but only because the majority of the lecture was copied straight from the textbook. :: the lecture was but it took days or even a week at times to receive grades. :: no. :: all we did was take notes that didn't help for the exam. :: just wrote down the textbook on the board. :: No. He opened the textbook and were lecture straight out of the book. His lecture notes were hand written in paint on the computer and we could barely read his handwriting half the time. It was more beneficial to have the book in front of you and read along to what he was discussing. :: not at all. :: no. :: Sometimes but it was really simple and straight forward. :: unorganized. :: Organization is not his strong suit.   I am used to more presentation than the projector work he did. If it was not for the in class participation, I think I could have done most of the work on my own at home (e.g. definitions, example problems) the useful content was his derivation and inclass clues to some of the things he felt were important to learn. :: yes. :: Just followed exactly as the book word for word but somehow managed to make that unorganized. :: The content and lectures were organized in the fact that the routine was the same everyday; Dr. Farajian was late to class, he would open his book and begin reading from where we left off. However, not all material was covered and the amount of material we covered would range from day to day. :: yes. :: Lectures and content were organized for the most part. :: yes. :: not at all. :: Not at all. We did not finish the course material. There were discussions that took place in class, but ended up in a lot of wasted time. :: I think they were well organized. :: no, they were not. :: Yes. They were organized by the authors of the textbook. :: Course content followed the textbook. :: yes but they were just out of the book and you could have not come to class all semester and learned the same stuff. :: No, professor just read from the book and spent the whole class copying formulas straight from the book.  Even when going over the few examples coverd he would just write the answer with little explanation of how to do the bulk of the work required to get the correct answer."
1344,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- no. :: Nope. See above answers. :: Never went to him outside of class. :: Available for office hours, but very poor email communication. :: No. :: I didn't want to contact him at all. :: yes. :: This was his one good quality is that he was always available during his office hours to talk if needed. But as I mentioned above, he never responded to emails. :: no. :: no. :: Yes. :: less than most professors, mostly doesn't respond to email. :: i never went to office hours. :: It is a rare thing if he replies to an email. :: Dr. Farajian would stay after class for a few minutes to answer students questions, however his treatment and answers given to certain students deterred me, personally, to see him during any further hours. :: yes. :: Email, again, was just a hard thing to use with him. I would recommend having maybe another hour worth of office hours in the future. Office hours were only for 30 minutes each Monday and Wednesday which didn't feel like nearly enough time. :: yes. :: 60/40 chance of seeing him in his office. :: Yes, he was helpful during office hours and he answered an email of mine promptly and helpfully. :: I heard that he wasn't because he only had 30 minutes on two different days but he was in possibly two different rooms. He should have had more office hour time. :: I did not meet with him out of class due to his consistently condescending tone in response to in class questions. I worried that he might begin to arbitrarily dock points from my projects and tests as a punishment for taking his time. :: He was routinely difficult to contact outside of class. :: No response to emails. :: no"
1345,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I would strongly recommend a recitation section for this course, I feel like it would greatly improve the students understanding of the subject. :: Gets very frustrated and likes to argue when students have questions about material that he doesn't want to answer during class. :: Thermodynamics is a hard course in general so why would wright state not have a recitation for this course. Also there should be more teacher options for thermodynamics. :: This isn't a terrible class, but definitely needs some improvement. Exams weren't reflective of the range of material covered in that section. Only a couple topics covered for a very large amount of content covered in class. Expectations from students for this course are not comparable to credit hours associated with this class.  This class definitely didn't seem like a priority to the instructor because he was usually late to class, didn't return any grades in a timely manner, etc. :: He should be seriously reviewed and evaluated to see if he is fit to teach. :: I wish I could get my money back for this class because it was a waste of time and money. :: I can tell it was his first time teaching, disappointed I paid lots of money for such bad teachers. Shame on the engineering dept for cutting sections of everything, and making classes so big due to their debt while the students suffer. :: teach better next time. :: bad prof. :: Nope. :: Amir Farajian should not be a professor at Wright State University. He gives WSU a bad name and makes students feel as though they have wasted their money. :: I felt the class was more challenging because of the professor than the content. :: no. :: Terrible teacher. :: I am writing this evaluation in the hopes that both Dr. Farajian and the Dean of Engineering will truly read this evaluation. I do believe that Dr. Farajian's attitude, knowledge, and efforts should not be accepted at Wright State University and my experience in his class has made me struggle with continuing my education at Wright State. However, I have had many great professors at Wright State and I will not allow Dr. Farajian's class to reflect on the entire Engineering Department. :: Yes, the content of thermo 1 is broad, exams reviews should be made specific on the particular kinds of question that will be asked on the exam. Recitations should also be added to the lecture to aid student success. :: As frustrating as this semester has been, I think Dr. Farajian is a good professor. There has just been a general level of frustration for the students in the class with him. I don't think Thermodynamics I should ever be less than an hour long class. There is far too much content to cover for the classes to be 55 minutes long. If I'm honest, I wish I had taken my money to Sinclair over the summer and done the class. I've heard nothing but good things for Thermodynamics from people who took it at Sinclair. I feel as if our school should too have that reputation for being the go-to for these kinds of classes. Thanks for reading and considering my criticisms. :: no. :: i would highly recommend evaluating him as a professor because it has ruined alot of peoples views in my class of wright state and a large majority are talking about transferring because of this experience. :: Thermodynamics needs a recitation. In class, all we learned were concepts. There was an occasional question at the end of class which we were supposed to solve in groups. The exam had one conceptual question and two problems to solve. I did not like how the exams did not represent what we learned in class. If there were a recitation, then we could learn how to solve the problems and more people would have a strong understanding and pass the class. :: There were some people in the class that disrespected the professor. People believed taht he did not do well teaching and preparing us for the exams. However, I did fine on the exams without studying much just by paying attention and writing all of the equations from class on my allowed cheat sheet. He is not a terrible professor. He is pretty okay as a professor. :: It would be more productive to have the text(which was infinitely more helpful than Amir Farajian)  for the class be an assigned reading and take two midterms and a final just based on that than to sit through Amir Farajian's slow and lazy regurgitation of the book. It was extremely apparent that the requirements for the project were so vague and unhelpful because they were hastily and thoughtlessly assembled. I would much rather take this class with a student in thermo 2 than with Amir Farajian. :: He seemed like a nice guy at least. :: no"
1346,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The professor taught directly from the book and was not very good at explaining concepts in terms that were easy to comprehend. Tests were mainly derivations that I personally do not feel we were prepared for. The class range for exams was 30-100 % and there was less than 15 people in this class. Homework did not make sense, and class structure was hard to follow since notes were drawn all over the place on a projector screen. Numerical examples given by the professor were not helpful. His syllabus is not clear. More on that in the next section. He would ask the class if what he said made sense, and most of the time classmates did not know what to ask to understand the material. I feel as if I learned nothing, and had to jump through so many hoops for this class because of the Instructor. He is a very smart person, but he is not an understandable instructor. :: excellent. :: Low. Most of class was spent doing conceptual and not much practical application was done. The low number of homework assignments didn't help. I felt really lost on the exams because they didn't seem to have much relation to what went on in class. I don't feel like I learned a lot in this class. :: Honestly, I did learn about four laws of thermodynamics and how they apply to different systems, but it was just a basic understanding.  When going in great detail in this class, many of my classmates and I were completely dumbfounded.  It is difficult material.  If the exams were easier, I would feel much more comfortable taking this class.  I always felt like I was lagging behind and didn't quite grasp all of the topics discussed. :: The instructor is very intelligent, but the effectiveness of his teaching in thermodynamics of materials is hit or miss.  The majority of the class was spent deriving equations which we rarely ever used, and is almost entirely copied word for word, letter for letter, from the book, which is not a very good book to begin with.  If you are unable to understand the book, he offers nothing extra in teaching the subject. Following along with his lectures in the book will help understand what he is doing, but it does not really teach thermodynamics well. :: Not effective. His lectures were just him writing the book on the board with no further explanation. The entire class regularly discussed how they haven't actually learned much of anything and expressed how they will avoid him like the plague in further coursework. He basically only taught theory and never worked through examples. All of WSU engineering experience has been learning the why, and then working through problems until we understand how to solve stuff we may encounter. He just had us write derivations all day and that was pretty much it. :: Awful. Taught straight from the book. The book was already hard to understand and him teaching the same method did not help in my learning. This is my least favorite class that I have taken during my entire college career due to the fact that I did not understand what the material throughout the entire semester. :: Moderately effective. Feel as if I have to teach myself or not understand. :: I, and to my knowledge, nobody in the class, really understand the material. Like, we are all still confused about entropy at equilibrium. The professor is clearly smart and knows what he's talking about, but he is not great at communicating that information. :: Dr. Farajian is an amazing professor. The best part in his teaching, he explains the basics so well."
1347,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I think that valuable information is missing from his syllabus about group projects. Based on what the syllabus says, he did not evaluate group projects correctly. Only after the assignment,did he elaborate what was actually required. Which was not mentioned in the syllabus. :: good. :: Yes. :: Not exactly.  It was much more lax than I anticipated. :: Yes, however, the syllabus is very vague, and many groups did not understand what the expectations even were, mainly for the papers and presentations we had to complete before every exam. As an example, there is no outline for what a ""good poster presentation"" is, however you are graded on the poster presentation as if you know how to deliver one already. :: sure. :: No. Never gave any feedback on work. Would take 4-6 to grade anything. Very unorganized class. The syllabus was poorly written and hard to understand what was being asked to do. The exams are nothing like the class or the material in the book. There should be more prep for the exam because we usually have no idea what to study for the exam, the worked out numerical examples are nothing like the exam. Some times there were sections of material that we were told would be on the exam and it would never be on the exams. :: Not really. Was very lost most of the time when it came to his grading and evaluating. :: Possibly. We never get feedback on our work. :: Yes he did."
1348,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, he was even late to tests, and did not have tests prepared. That was not fair to us, nor appropriate. :: yes. :: Aside from being late for the midterm exams (like, really, the only classes you were late for were the exams? come on) yes he was on time and used the full class time. :: During lecture, yes.  There was a time when he was 25 minutes late to an exam, and we were still supposed to turn it in at the end of the set class period.  That was a bad day. :: The instructor was late on occasion, due to him having another class 10 minutes before our class starts.  During our first mid-term, the instructor was 30 minutes late to class, and did nothing to help students complete the mid-term in the shortened time given to us due to his absence. :: No. He was 5-20 minutes late for every single class and was 30 minutes late for one of our exams and then criticized the class for not getting it done with 30 minutes less time. :: Yes. Usually used entire class for teaching. :: Routinely, yes. Was late but it was because of another class of his going over. :: Class started on time when we didn't have exams. During tests class would start 10-20 minutes late. :: I think there were two occasions he didn't start the class on time, it's not because he was irresponsible but he was discussing with students from  the previous class. So that's totally cool."
1349,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He would routinely ask if we understood the material, but he never really answered questions in an understandable way, so I resorted not asking and seeking help online after class. :: he did it very well. :: Answered questions in class. :: He talked with us about real world applications of the materials we were learning and will eventually learn. :: The instructor asks a lot of questions for the class and wants each student to understand the material, however as I stated before, the material is just deriving equations, not really much actual understanding of the physics or thermo itself. :: He didn't really. :: None. Did not respond to emails in a timely manner. :: Cared enough to go out of his way to make sure my accommodations were met during testing. :: He expected us to go out and find information rather than just giving it to us. That would be great if we didn't have other classes and work. :: He find different ways of explanation for the same concept to help me understand better."
1350,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- I honestly did not understand things and was confused by almost everything that was going on. I mainly get As and understand material, but his responses never made sense to me, and even when he would elaborate, it made it more confusing. :: very effectively and made sure everything is going well. :: Sent out emails with information, told us of homework assignments in class. :: In the classroom he communicated effectively.  Outside of the classroom, however, I found it a little difficult to understand everything that was expected. :: The instructor took quite a long time to grade and return any homework, papers, or presentations that were done during the semester, however he was available whenever needed via e-mail. :: He didn't really teach the material, more like regurgitated the information in the book. The class doesn't really require much out of class communication. If by this you mean ""did he respond to emails?"" then yes he responded actually pretty well. :: Not. He is very knowledgeable about the topic but does not know how to teach information to students. He would write every equation from the book (even though most were just the derivations of the final equation). Although this class is mainly about entropy and enthalpy and other thermodynamics, I still do not understand the key concepts of this class. They were never explained in a way that I actually understand, even when asked multiple times. :: Well. :: Needs better handwriting- at times it is illegible, especially when using the computer. :: On a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 7."
1351,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I really do not think so. Teaching straight from the book with no supplementing material does not work with his teaching style. He would ask about our intuition on a concept before he had actually taught the concept. :: yes. :: They seemed to be while in class but we moved slow through them and didn't cover as much material as he wanted too. :: In my opinion the lectures were well organized and seemingly came out of the book.  Passed that though, the projects were all over the place. :: They are as well organized as the thermodynamics book is, which is not very well. :: It was just .writing the book down. :: The lectures were straight from the book. Most days the professor would ask the students if he wrote it down correctly as we looked in the book to verify if he was correct. He should know what he is teaching. The class was very hard to follow along and very hard to understand the material. :: I knew what chapter and section we were on, but felt as if we focused in on things that did not matter and wasted alot of class time. :: I'd guess not, since we are 4 chapters short of where we should be. :: yes, It was."
1352,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I tried reaching out to him, and some of my questions were answered, but not all of them. :: yes. :: Yes. :: In my experience, no. :: Yes, he was available as often as necessary. :: Yes. :: N/a. :: yes. :: Yes, he was active."
1353,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I honestly think this class could be taught so much better. Evaluate how material is presented. This is hard material. It does not need to be made harder. :: nope. :: The papers were useless in terms of learning anything. The topics were obscure in terms of actually finding any relevant information about them. You almost made it out to be we needed to be in the lab recording the data instead of trying to find someone else's research on the topic. I mean, ""You can't use that topic, it is mainstream and there is a lot of information on it"" isn't a good reason. We aren't doing ground breaking research in these papers. If someone else hasn't put the information out there, we certainly aren't going to be able to figure it out. We had no idea what was going on and our main goal was to get something on the page. Complete waste of time. :: Good guy, knows what he is talking about, but goes into too much detail and needs to me more clear about what is expected, especially when it comes to grading. :: I believe the instructor is very intelligent and a good teacher, however the design of the class does not promote learning of the material.  Memorizing and deriving a hundred equations is not an effective way to teach a course that, while math heavy, should also have some understanding of its impact on the real world and their implications.  I hope that in the future more time is spent discussing what the equations describe and how they effect the thermodynamics of materials, and less time writing the same equations 50 times with different assumptions. There is also a very very small amount of the course that is materials related, so i am not sure how it differs from the normal thermodynamics class. :: Nice guy, talked to us about how he liked us as a class, but it was very disappointing to spend 15 weeks just transcribing the book to my notes. I think he could be a great professor if he just showed interest in our success and taught at least one example now an then. :: If the professor expects us to write a paper/presentation in less than a week ( with all the other classes that we are taking) it should only take him a week to grade it. For every paper it took him 4-6 to grade the papers and wouldn't let us start the next paper until he graded the past paper limiting the time for us to write the next paper. Although he said he gave us requirements for the paper written in the syllabus, it was poorly written and hard to understand that was being ask/what was required the syllabus needs to be rewritten with better parameters for the paper/presentation. :: Nothing, thank you."
1354,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. :: okay. :: good. :: Alright he tries but lectures are disorganized and have no real structure to them. I feel as if this class is supposed to be a data analysis class but really is just all over the map with the material that we cover. :: Far below standard, could not have been more disappointed in this course's instruction or lack thereof. Poorly executed, did not seem to care if students succeeded in the course or not as long as they understood what data meant. Fine for theoretical practice, but destroying students GPAs because of your poor quality of teaching is shameful. Kindly stop ""teaching"" because most of our class has this same exact viewpoint of your instruction quality. I hope I never have the misfortune of having you for a teacher again. :: Class felt pointless to attend. Would go over example problems in class, but not give enough time to write them down. The lab section was too large for only 1 TA and 1 instructer to help during the period. :: Not very effective. :: Rough. Notes were extremely hard to read and explanations did little help. :: poor. :: Dr. Jackson can be unorganized at times but overall did a decent job of teaching the subject. He has a lot of practical knowledge which he shares on a normal basis. :: m. :: the worst class in history. he doesn't know anything about the subject waste time and if your student with color you get picked on and have to prove and show everything you do, for example he always ask them to prove there work and question them and blame them for cheating even if they never did. And he  have threaten more than one student that he will report them and he did that with group and he refused meeting with them,then it was proved that the student didn't cheated but used the pilot file like every other student but unfortunately for him if you not white your cheater till proven not. :: He was not very effective. I found it difficult to learn from him because he would go off on a tangent. There were also equations that would have been nice to talk about in class and what they mean. Sometimes we did cover some and sometimes we did not. He was a super nice guy and meant the best but the teaching did not help me what so ever. He said it may have helped to have more LA's and he may have been correct but I am not sure. Our LA did not do much other than when it came to lab help. :: Not very effective. Hard to follow. Lecture material was presented as theory first in powerpoint form--good! However, the slides were moved through too quickly to effectively take notes. Often I would get halfway through writing out a concept or transcribing an equation and realize the slide had changed. This would not be a huge issue if the slides were posted on Pilot, but more often than not they were not posted. Example problems were done from the textbook--also good! However, this presented a couple issues. If an example was worked out on the projector, handwriting became an issue. Work was messy, scattered, or nearly illegible at times. If the solution was presented in a printed out problem, the same issue as the powerpoint slides came up: the example was moved through too quickly to take effective notes. And if we were asked to do the problem individually or as a class, either we were not given enough time or a specific solution was never given beyond ""Johnny got 54, but Bill got 229,001. Okay next problem.."". :: This was class was the most waste of time I have ever experienced.  I have not learned anything from the course.  A huge waste of money as well. :: NOT EFFECTIVE WHAT-SO-EVER.  Class lectures were a complete waste of time.  Nothing was ever really taught, some lectures we were literally told to get out our books and read them.  We then were told to ask questions, he answered NONE of the classes questions, he would try to have us answer each other. (kinda hard to do when no one learning anything.)  He cancelled many classes. HE CHANGED THE WEIGHT OF THE CLASS SECTIONS 3 TIMES!!  Twice the week before finals! His handwriting was so horrible no one could read it. He was so disorganized during lectures no one could follow.  When he assigned homework he never posted it anywhere, he would write it on the board for 5 seconds, then remove it ( no one could read what was assigned). Acted like you were dumb if you asked a question, and would not answer. Terrible class, learned nothing, Glad it is almost over. :: Relatively effective. He makes sure that the students understand the key principles taught in the course in the way that they apply to real life scenarios. His ability to teach students how to solve the problems for the course is lacking however. He's great one on one though. Perhaps he could just go over how to do problems step by step to aid in student ability to work through problems presented on homework and exams. :: Non-existent. It was difficult to learn in this class or even follow what was going on. The instructor rambled incessantly which only further added to the disaster which was ME3600-01. :: The lecture were very boring.  It seemed like he took a long time on not a lot of material and the students lost interest. On the other hand, he is very willing to listen to any complaints and adjust accordingly. :: Good. :: Dr. Jackson's teaching was iffy at the best of times. Most of the slideshows I got very little out of. It is telling that the most effective instruction in this course came from fully solved problems projected onto the board. He often gets talking about tangential topics that help us little practically or in the course. :: Dr. Jackson taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: Largely ineffective. Lectures are too fast to actually hold any information. Tests are frustrating due to a feeling of being lost for a majority of the lectures. They are fair otherwise. Labs are disorganized. Only having one TA made the labs a mess. :: Dr. Jackson was somewhat effective in his teaching. There never really seemed to be much structure in his lectures, so it was very easy to get lost in his class. :: Dr. Jackson was fairly effective. I thought the first half of the semester was rough because I didn't get a good understanding of the material but as the semester went on Dr. Jackson was very effective in his teaching. :: He was decently effective. :: caring and dedicated professor. Had a rough semester but persevered and did his best teaching job. :: i barely understand what he says in class. :: The overall effectiveness of the instructor was quite poor. I consider this primarily a consequence of the class format. With 60+ students sitting in a room in Student Success Center, all facing different directions (half of them not facing the instructor), trying to learn math heavy material from a lecturer, to expect any kind of effectiveness is ridiculously optimistic. I personally consider the MME department's apparent ambivalence for this class's section size, room choice, and text, an embarrassment to the college. :: Not very effective at all. The way the class is designed is not the best, it should definitely be a lecture hall class. The book that is used in the class has a lot of mistakes in it, not helping with the learning of the material at all. Something always went wrong in lab, to the point where the class grading scale had to be adjusted three times due to a lab not going as planned. :: Low effectiveness, lectures were generally ineffective and reading the book provided the same amount of instruction as the professor. :: Not effective. :: very ineffective. :: This instructor was not very effective in teaching the material. We just jumped around to different sections of the book which was hard to follow. Some of the book answers and examples were wrong which made things difficult. Also the things written on the projector were very difficult to read and to follow. He could have done a much better job of Assigning homeworks. He just did them by casual mention in class and never even gave the full details about due dates. :: He covered the material verbally and related it to real world situations from his own experiences which was nice. :: Much more effective at teaching material when going through examples. :: He is not an effective instructor. I did not learn anything from him. I did not understand anything because of the way he teaches. By far the worst professor I have ever had. He goes on rants and does not focus on the topics. He expects the student to know everything. He has favoritism, his favorite students get A's in the labs and the homework. He does not go over problems step by step, if someone yells the right answer, he will move on to the next question. Students have continuously complained about the grading system, the way he teaches, and his overall quality as a teacher. He does not have what it takes to be a professor. Sadly, Wright State has no money to hire a decent professor and begged him to come back to teach. Therefore the students do not have a choice and these evaluations are worthless."
1355,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- No. The syllabus changed twice to alter how much each assignment was worth for the final grade. :: yes. :: yes. :: His syllabus changed quite often. Grading was liking drawing a number out of a hat for homework. :: No. due to lack of preparation and organization, labs were not able to be run, we didnt get our graded assignments back at all, and they were graded harshly but not returned so we never knew what we did wrong. :: No. The syllabus grade distributions changed 3 times within the last 2 weeks of class, making it very difficult to evaluate how well you were doing in the course. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes he did. :: no he changed the grading twice. he told us one of labs is not with much at all. the day of lab we didn't have time he told people to wait because he didn't know what to do. till the last minutes in class then helped them and told them you can satay after class and they didn't stay an a hour after class because he didn't know how to do the lab he need it to see how other student will do it first. then the day after he email us and say that lab worth 14% now. :: For the most part. He ended up changing some things from the syllabus and the weight distribution of the grades. The material was covered like it said in the syllabus though. :: Mostly. Some weighting had to be changed because we essentially skipped a lab we were supposed to do a full report on. This is at no fault of the instructor. Partially faulty equipment is to blame. But this is also due to the fact that we did not have an LA/TA/lab assistant (we needed multiple for such a large lab) present, so the vast majority of the class could not get their equipment to work properly. PLEASE provide more lab assistants or whatever for this class--even if it is just for the lab. It is needed. I would have benefitted. Don't continue cutting funding because your students will suffer the consequences more than anyone else. :: No, more than half way through the semester he changes the grading criteria in the syllabus.  These changes ended up hurting us all not helping us.  Than instead of getting our homework back in class we had to make a special trip to the MME dept. to pick it up.  No feedback on the homework on what we did wrong. :: no. :: yes. :: I really have no idea. I have not received but a couple grades back and have no feedback on anything. :: For the most part. :: well enough. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The grading scale has changed so many times, but it is not completely his fault. One day, our LabVIEW software was not operating correctly, so as a result, he needed to push back one of our labs. When he pushed it back, he changed the amount of work that needed to be done in that specific lab. Because of this, he needed to change the grading scale so that it would match the amount of work. Overall, our grading scale has changed many times, so the scale in the syllabus is not the same as the final scale. However, I do believe Dr. Jackson is trying to be very fair in the new grading scale, and he is trying to accommodate the needs of the class as best as possible. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson followed the syllabus exactly. :: To a point yeah. :: yes,. :: not at all the time. :: No. Due to delays caused by lab equipment that wasn't functioning, the final lab requirements were simplified. As a result the instructor altered the weight of each assignment in the class grade. I realize the choice was made in response to unforeseen events, however it borders on unethical to alter the grading structure mid semester. :: Yes, and no, simply because we strayed from the syllabus so much. The grader also did not specify why points were taken off on homeworks. :: It is unknown because as of this time no labs or homework assignments have been graded or returned to any students. :: Sometimes. :: yes, but I would have been more prepared for the evaluations if 60% of every class wasn't spent with him struggling and complaining about the projector. :: No he changed the grading percentages drastically which was not good. He did this more than once. :: He followed and adjusted the grading scale when a lab wont work but other than that he stuck to the original . :: Yes. :: No."
1356,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The professor was routinely a few minutes late to get things started. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Full period used, and more, since he could never tell when he was supposed to stop. :: Yes. :: Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared so class would not really be started even though he was there on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: no we waste more than half of lab because he never ready we skipped multiple lab times because he not ready or he doesn't know how blame CAT. he never prepared for any lab or have good idea of them. :: Yes he usually did. If anything he canceled class but he was having family issues at the time so I would not say it is a terrible thing. :: Yes. :: No, we would start usually 30 minutes late but end on time. :: no. Late to labs often, and cancelled class. :: Yes. Class was always started on time and the full period was used. :: Yes. But this time was largely wasted on explaining nothing. :: most of the time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson always started and ended class on time. :: yes, every class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No the professor was regularly tardy, it was usually only a few minutes late but it was not uncommon for the professor to start the class 10-15 minutes late. :: Yes but not effectively. :: yes. :: Most of the time. :: Yes, expect a few family emergencies that were understandable. :: Yes. :: No."
1357,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Jackson paces throughout the room during lecture, which encourages students to pay attention. He is very receptive to feedback which is greatly appreciated. :: yes. :: good. :: No. :: Nope, couldn't have given a crap less than he did, at zero interest in student comprehension. :: Adding a curve to the first exam. :: Yes. He was more helpful one-on-one with specific questions than teaching to the group. :: Good question. :: no. :: You can tell that Dr. Jackson cares about his students and tries to make sure that the class is taught in a fair manner. :: terrible he made me hate the engineering because his engineering ethic is bad. :: He would try and bring things in lab to help our understanding. :: Nothing particularly outstanding here. :: He didn't.  He made the topics we discussed in class more stressful and harder to learn than they needed to be. :: no. :: He made sure we all took away the important concepts for future jobs. :: Vaguely. It could have been confused with frustration towards our lack of understanding what on earth was going on. :: He related the material to real life scenarios. :: He attempted to answer student's questions, although sometimes it seemed he didn't know what exactly students were asking and answered a different question. :: Dr. Jackson had us work on examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: He attempted to answer any and all questions we had. :: He asked tons of open ended questions in class and was responsive to any questions that we had for him. :: Dr. Jackson would assign problems for the class to work through in class to create an active learning environment and come by each table to offer assistance. Dr. Jackson was also very helpful during office hours. :: Showed a great interest in our learning. :: Always took time for the students and showed care for us as individuals. :: i didn't get much. :: He encouraged participation in class. :: The professor assured us that this material would be beneficial in the workplace and so we should listen. :: Not sure. :: He demonstrated more interest in our learning than he did teaching. :: Yes. :: Applying the material to real world situations, its always nice to see how topics can be applied. The down side is there is so much to cover that sometimes it isn't possible to do it in depth. :: Very caring individual for his students. :: Absolutely not. He did not demonstrate interest in my learning."
1358,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Jackson's written and verbal instructions are often very vague. It is difficult to know exactly how something in the lab should be done or to understand what he's saying when he's explaining a concept in lecture. Often when someone asks a question in lecture, it is not answered directly. :: well. :: good. :: No. :: the absolute worst. responded to emails days afterwards or not at all. :: Overall pretty well, but would cancel class without emailing us. Only posting a note on the class door. :: Out of the classroom he communicated better than in. :: Could have been better with some of the homework assigned as it was very hard to read the written on the computer. :: pretty good. :: Dr. Jackson communicates well, except for sometimes homework assignments were not communicated well enough. I recommend posting the homework to pilot and setting a due date. :: he refused to meet with student after he file academic integrity file. even though wright state clearly say he should have meet with them before that. :: He was hit or miss at times. I think he had a hard time understanding what the questions were. :: Somewhat effectively. Homework assignments and due dates were sometimes unclear.  Reasonable out-of-class communication, although occasionally I would arrive at the classroom to find a note on the door saying class was canceled but no email in my inbox. :: He was not encouraging or helpful. Also would not respond to emails and had only 1 day of office hours. :: no. :: well. :: No. :: Good. :: He was ineffective in communicating many of the points he tried to make. There were many instances where I left classes feeling I hadn't gained anything from the lecture whatsoever. Very poor at explaining how to do problems, or even why we doing them. :: Dr. Jackson used both email and Pilot to communicate well. :: He communicated effectively. :: Pretty effectively. :: Dr. Jackson was very effective in communicating with the students. :: Communicated very well, especially with the circumstances going on in his life at the moment. :: Struggled at times with relaying information to the students. :: i can't say much.. :: Somewhat effectively. It would have been better if he posted the homework assignments online or emailed them rather than just mentioning them in class once. :: He was not effective, examples and review problems were not explained well and would only provide the answer not how the answer to a problem was calculated or derived. :: Not very. :: 3/5. :: Not very well for assigning homeworks and getting stuff posted to pilot. :: He was there for his office hours when I ask and helped me through a lab. Homework assigned in class was the only issue I had, sometimes rude classmates would talk over him and I would miss assigned work. :: Not effectively. Ignores emails and coming to his office hours did not help."
1359,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes but could have been more organized. :: yes. :: No. :: Never, this is not what I paid you for by taking your class. :: Somewhat. When he wrote on the board it was very difficult to understand. His hand writing was difficult to read and he skipped steps of problems. Also he did in class reading, then having students ask and answer eachothers questions. This made him seem unprepared at times. :: No. The material had little sequence and was not presented well. :: Nope. :: no. :: Yes. :: Dr. Jackson stayed on topic pretty well, the only criticism I have is sometimes he did not introduce the topic really well. There were times where I knew what the math was but had no clue what topic we were even on. :: NO. :: I believe they were sometimes. Other times they were not. It was hit and miss. :: Somewhat organized. The schedule was followed very loosely and at times it seemed like there was no plan at all for that particular day. Topics were sometimes random and jumped around a lot. :: No they were not. He hardly had any notes, if he did have notes you couldn't read his handwriting. He also didn't know how to work the technology that was used in the classroom. :: NO. MOST DISSORGANIZED PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. :: Yes they were. :: They didn't seem to be organized at all. :: Not really. :: He followed his powerpoints. They weren't all that good, but we followed them. :: Yes. :: No. Oftentimes everything felt rushed and all over the place. I rarely felt like I understood what was going on, even on statistics, which was a course I took in high school. Even though I already understood the material, I felt confused each lecture. :: Not exactly. We skipped around from chapter to chapter, and I really don't know why. Looking back on my notes and the book, I think that this class would have been easier if we would've followed the book in the order that it is written. I also think that the lectures were not always the most organized. Most of the time, it seemed like he would come in and just wing it. :: Yes, the lectures were well organized. :: Yes and no, and that's because of lab equipment not working and personal issues the instructor had to deal with, both of which are not his fault. :: Could stand to be more organized. :: not at ALL, the labs wasn't organized he had to reduce the percentage for the last lab report from 20% to 10%, an splits it on exams and hw. :: No. :: No, lecture was always all over the place, and whatever examples the professor wrote on the projector were always very hard to read. :: Very unorganized, specifically laboratories were organized very poorly to the point that one or two labs had to be scrapped and two hours of student's time was wasted because the professor did not attempt the lab himself or did not explain the procedure correctly. :: No. :: absolutely not, but it is hard to tell if it was his fault or the book's. :: No it was hard to follow what was going on. :: Yes very well organized by chapter. :: The lectures lacked structure which hurt me. The book used I felt was not good for teaching this course. There were too many equations to draw from and not enough examples provided in the book. :: No. It was very disorganized and did not make any sense. It displayed how much the professor graded you as to how much he liked you."
1360,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. Unhelpful in the extreme. Don't know what your time was spent in your office doing, but it clearly wasnt grading assignments for speedy return. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was. :: no. :: He was not always in his office hours but he would be if we let him know we would be stopping by. :: Absolutely. Due to an athletics conflict, I had to miss a midterm. Dr. Jackson was very understanding and worked with me to find a time I could make up the exam. No complaints here. :: No, he was not. :: yes he was. :: Reasonably, but he wasn't always helpful. Sometimes consulting the professor left one more confused then when he started. Other times one was told the answer but not explained why. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson was readily available and responded quickly to emails. :: Yes, whenever I needed to meet with him he was available and always willing to meet. :: yes. :: yes. :: He was responsive with emails. :: Yes he was. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. He was never available."
1361,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: No. :: For the love of all that is holy, if you have even a shred of respect for the students who pay to take classes at this university, either up your standard of operation by an extreme amount, or do everyone a favor and stop teaching. :: The textbook was written very poorly and would recommend attempting to find a different one for this course in the future. :: Dr. Jackson needs more support from TAs, but also needs to refine his lecture material. :: Nope. :: did not get what I paid for. :: No. :: No, overall a decent semester with some hiccups but Dr. Jackson was very aware of that and considerate of that. :: i wish wright state start viewing what he's teaching. :: From my experience with Allen Jackson; I would not take him again and I can't believe the university has kept him as a professor here.  If you're going to fire anyone it should be him. :: HO HO HO, so happy to be getting out of this class. :: Great guy. I just wish he prepared us better for exams. You could do the homework and study really hard and get torn apart on the exams. Many found the wording very tough and the problems took far too much time to solve in the given time unless you knew exactly what to do immediately. I found myself running out of time on exams and getting a bad grade even though I knew what to do. I just couldn't work fast enough. Some did not have this issue however. He was fantastic at making sure that we knew why the work was important.  Overall a great person and someone you can learn a lot from. :: I understand this class was understaffed which created great difficulties for the Professor and although I sympathized, I don't feel this is ample excuse for how poorly this class was run. There were several issues with the lab equipment, but these would not have been as dire if the professor didn't routinely spend 30-45 mins talking before starting lab. This in itself furthered the issues and added frustration. :: Dr. Jackson seems like a pretty good guy, but his instruction is more than a little lacking. This was easily one of the most ineffective courses I have ever taken. I tend to be a straight-A student, but I often struggled even trying to grasp many of the concepts in this class because of the poor explaining. The labs' structure fell apart because of insufficient instructions and poor equipment. If this wasn't a required class, I absolutely would never have taken it. If I had to take it again, I would absolutely look for a different professor. Again, nothing against Dr. Jackson personally, I just can't say that he was an effective professor in any regard. :: Slower lectures and more problems worked in conjunction with the lecture itself instead of just doing them for review would have been very helpful. :: No. :: I heard terrible things about this class before the semester started but now, I don't think the class was that bad at all. I learned a lot and had fun this semester!. :: Appreciated him going through with the class even though he did not have to, especially with what is going on in his life at the moment. He did as good of a job that he could have with everything that was going on. :: The class should be restructured, a different, more correct and clear book should be used, and some of the the labs should be redone, along with the lab manual. :: I would not recommend this instructor to anyone, however since he is the only person to teach this course students do not have a choice and have to sit through his mandatory lectures despite the fact that the same amount of learning and instruction could be gained if a student merely read the book. His laboratories were the worst part of the class, he would regularly come in 10-15 minutes late and provide a procedure which could not be followed unless someone had extensive experience in signal analysis or have used LabView extensively. As this was my first time ever using LabView it was nearly impossible for me to complete the lab by myself and had to receive help from other students. Additionally, there were times when the lab was cancelled because a large number of the students could not complete the lab due to the labs being very vague. :: No. :: the strain gage lab was a bigger disaster than the Iraq war. :: Thanks for the good semester. In the future make sure the pockets of rude people get broken up so your lectures can be heard. :: The class size was too large with too few TA's for effective teaching and help for students. :: No, because students opinions do not matter with the engineering department."
1362,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The Instructor was very effective overall. :: He good. :: Overall, Dr. Jackson is effective. :: He is a good instructor and enjoy his lectures. :: Very good. :: good. :: It makes everyone to work in real life so that's makes some of classes we took in ME real and visible. :: The professor was effective in his labs. :: Dr. Jackson is a great teacher. He provided great instruction for the experiments in class. He graded fairly and was very helpful inside and outside the class. :: Very effective labs were clearly laid out. :: Very effective, he applied his experience in the field to instruction in the class."
1363,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he is. :: The labs were all graded like he said. He did have a stipulation in his syllabus that if you were not able to answer questions about the report you submitted, you would receive a zero. While this is rather harsh, he did not live up to this, even though there were a plethora of students that would have deserved this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
1364,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Given the nature of the course this question is non applicable. Specific days were scheduled to introduce various experiments, but most class periods served as an assured chance for groups to meet to complete experiments. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he never been late even once. :: He utilized class time well. :: class started on time. :: Yes. This being a lab course, we only had to meet for the intro to each lab. He would start on time, show us everything we needed and answered any questions. :: Yes. :: yes"
1365,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor would ask about any odd results in a lab. :: yes. :: The lab we were working in is way too small it was hard to see what Dr. Jackson was even working with due to all of the students including myself being in the lab. :: Yeah he would answer questions unrelated to the class if you asked. :: yes. :: perfect. :: yes, give us a lot of example he really wanted everybody to learn not just even pass the class. :: He wanted to make sure you gained something from the labs, and that the conclusions that you came to were logical and accurate. :: available for questions outside of class time. :: He would make sure we understood the material. He would have group meetings to discuss data to make sure we knew what we were learning. :: Had students re-do portions of labs in which the recorded data didn't make sense. Gave them a chance to learn from their mistakes and know what to look for in the future. :: He was available outside of class for questions, and was present while the students conducted the experiments."
1366,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In class communication was very effective. Out of class communication was effective, but occasionally unavailable. :: no. :: Extremely well. Once I emailed him a question and he very emailed me back with a very detailed response that helped me with the lab. :: well he responded both to email and in his office hours. :: yes. :: strong. :: even though we don't have to attend the class he will be there for anyone who wants a help. for out the class you can email him or go to his office hours. :: Very well. :: Okay. He often times forgot what he said in office hours. :: Great. Dr. Jackson was available outside of class, whether in his office or online. He would answer in class questions as well. :: Very effectively. :: Very effectively, and he was always responsive to emails."
1367,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The labs were for the most part not always known for clarity. :: yes. :: yes. :: yup it does. :: The labs were more or less structured well. :: about as good as one can expect. :: Yes. Each experiment had a well written manual so that we could follow along. What was needed for each report was clearly described, and any additional information we needed was always provided. :: Yes. :: yes"
1368,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The course did not have scheduled office hours, I did not schedule an appointment this semester, and online communication was overall very reliable. :: no. :: Yes very much so. :: yes. :: yes, very available. :: yes. :: yes he did. :: The professor communicated with the class well and was available for consultation. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was in the lab or in his office whenever he was needed. He promptly replied to emails and answered any questions. :: Yes. :: yes"
1369,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The removal of assigned groups at the end of the semester could have been handled better. This semester, nearly all groups formed for the first such experiment made plans to be grouped during the last such experiment. An individual with poor group members is thus likely to have those same group members during both experiments, a poor position to be in. :: No. :: My favorite lab I've taken at WSU. :: no. :: nup. :: At the beginning of the semester, the professor stated that there would be assigned groups for the labs. What this turned into was him putting students that he deemed as bright with students that he knew struggled some (since he had had most of the students in previous courses). This had good intentions, but what it meant for the bright students in most cases would be for them to do the entire paper. As being a so called bright student, I would read the parts of the report that some other students contributed and it was often wrong, confusing, and/or written in poor English. I was then left to the choice of interpreting their work and trying to fix it, or just to redo the section all together, with the latter being the faster option. This turned into me just doing the entire paper. Granted, after much griping from students, he did change it to where the groups were chosen by the students. :: Wish the projects were graded more promptly. It was difficult to know if the work I was doing was acceptable. Lab manual does not do a good job of explaining what is required for the report (outdated requirements). :: Dr. Jackson is great. I appreciate the things he taught in this class, the helpfulness he provided and just being an overall nice guy to have as a professor. :: No"
1370,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson made this class much more difficult than it had to be.  He is a very nice gentleman, but generally speaking this class would be better if you got a grad student to make videos of the test procedures that we could watch.  Going to class to watch the procedure was usually a waste of time, except for the fact that the labs were poorly written.  Overall we got very little feedback in the class and our grades were much lower than I believe they should be. :: gd. :: very. :: very effective"
1371,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- The labs need to be rewritten in such a way that the students know what information is expected from the lab.  Also, we got very little feedback on the reports.  I know that it is just him and one other TA doing the grading, but there is a serious problem when December 1st rolls around and we only know 16 % of our grade and have written five out of six papers with no feedback whatsoever. :: yes. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1372,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Again, most of the class periods were a waste of time.  Also, there really should be a lab scheduler set up so that students can effectively get their work done in a timely manner.  This is how it works at a professional job, so why not allow students to experience scheduling equipment for blocks of time?. :: yes. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1373,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He is a genuinely nice guy and he tries to answer questions effectively. :: gd. :: by answering questions. :: yes
1374,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He often did not respond to emails, and overall communication outside of the classroom was difficult.  In the classroom he was fine. :: gd. :: very. :: yes"
1375,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I'm going to replace lectures with lab procedures and say no.  The labs are not very well written and they often don't match the procedure shown to us by Dr. Jackson.  I ended up just taking notes on what he showed us and ignoring the procedures most of the time. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes
1376,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He often did not respond to emails, and overall communication outside of the classroom was difficult. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1377,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Creating groups randomly was a terrible experience.  There are so many people who did not pull their weight in the project.  I realize that this happens in the workplace, but barring union involvement, there are typically repercussions to not doing work on a team project, i.e. getting fired.  There were no repercussions in this class regardless of the individual's work ethic.  Overall a terrible class with very little utility. :: gd. :: no. :: no additional comments. Just would like some of the assignments to be graded a little quicker, but overall was a good experience."
1378,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor covered a lot of material in the short amount of time. However, I struggled to learn with his teaching style. The activities were helpful but sometimes the lectures would be dry and hard to follow. I learned more from the reading and annotating than I usually did from the class periods. :: pretty good. :: Dr. S was a very effective professor. I learned a lot from him this semester. :: extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter, was enthusiastic when teaching, total effectiveness however was just ok, the entire class when it wasnt a quiz day and even having attendance worth part of your grade half the class would be absent. :: I feel like Professor Srinivasan had very little to do with my learning in this class.  Everything was based on outside reading and group work. :: the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well. :: Dr. S is a terrible professor.  He lacks any sort of teaching ability or knowledge of how to relate things to students.  Throughout this semester I have had an extremely hard time following along with the ""lectures"" that he gives on occasion. :: I haven't really learned all that much, the quizzes were not worth a large enough portion of my grade to put effort into studying for, compared to their difficulty. :: very effective. :: Not very effective. Hard to hear him in the large classroom setting even with the microphone turned on. The teaching style he utilized wasn't exactly the most effective. :: Difficult to understand.  rushed through topics, did not take the time to make sure the students understood the material. :: Not very at all. I felt like we were just googling things as a class this semester (literally, we're told to use the internet and outside resources for the group work). Also, I felt like I was just in an online class, and I honestly would've probably learned more if it was. I felt like too much of the course was digitized to be effective, especially in such a conceptual subject like Materials Science. I would've liked more instruction from you as an engineering professional, not just reading these online powerpoint slides. I'm coming to Wright State to interact with engineering professionals, not take an online course. I felt like there just needed to be more of your presence as an instructor, not a moderator for our ""self/group learning."" Please fix this!. :: The instructor himself understood the material very well, but in my opinion was not very effective at teaching the material. The lecture's were hard to follow and dry, and if it was clear that the students didn't understand the material he wouldn't explain it further. :: Very knowledgeable, bland lectures and sometimes tedious. :: He was good. :: He did a good job lecturing. This course was mostly a participation grade. Also, it was at eight in the morning and we mostly sat and listened to him lecturing. It was very difficult for the class to sit still and stay awake while the professor was lecturing as he does not have a loud, attention-grabbing voice. I did not like our online textbook. The annotations we did in our online book were graded very harshly. During the beginning of the course I thought it was impossible to get a 100% on one of them, but I managed a few 100%s. The annotations were worth 20% of our grade so it was a big deal. Also, annotations made learning harder because we were supposed to learn from each other. However, most students had a poor understanding of the concepts so annotations often taught the wrong way of looking at problems. Overall, annotations did not aid in learning, they hindered it. :: He was not the greatest. :: I'd give him a 6/10. :: He tried to teach the class, but it was not interesting enough to pay attention. :: The instructor was overall ineffective. :: Dr. Srinivasan was not very effective. :: This professor seems to care somewhat about student learning however, in class he did not teach very well.  He would give problems for us to do in class without explaining how to do them and then he would not give us the solution to the problems after we finished. This left many of us very confused and we never knew if our solutions were correct or not. :: He rarely lectures and when he does often primarily reads off the slides. There is little direction on the subject, seemingly random facts are given though. :: instructor knows the material well but the structure of the class gave no incentive to actually learn the material. :: I felt like his class was not fair at all. The group mattered more in his class. The final project I have done it all by myself just because my group didnât want to help at all. They got the same grade as me and they didnât do any work. This class wasnât fair at all, I felt like this class should have been an online course. :: fairly effective though a majority of learning was expected to take place outside of class; this method would have been effective in an active learning class if lecture time was spent working examples, but the time was spent on lectures. :: The instructor was rather ineffective, to my experience. :: Good. :: Not very. I feel I have no new knowledge on the subject, however, I will receive an A or B in the class. That is a fail on the instructors end. :: He is a kind man who shows passion for what he teaches. If you make an honest effort in the class, it is easy to succeed. :: Lectures are dry and difficult to follow. Did most of my learning outside of class. :: Not very effective. He always has his mic too low so it is difficult to hear. He provides great practice problems for each chapter but does not provide solutions to them and does not go over the solutions in class. :: Absolutely ineffective. :: Not very effective.  The class does not solidify any information whatsoever. It requires minimal effort and reading the book does not mean the students know the information off hand at any moment.  Lectures are poor as we go through examples and then don't always go through solutions. :: Effectiveness was mediocre. :: Instructor was not very effective in conveying the material. In the beginning of the semester a lot of time was wasted.  I learned the material better from online sources/slides from other schools etc. :: horrible, didn't learn a single thing. :: Moderately effective. :: He is not a very good teacher. :: Overall, I do not feel he was a very effective professor. Almost everything I learned this semester was just from me reading the book. His lectures were very vague, and did not answer many questions students asked of him. I have put a lot of hard work and effort into this class to make sure I get an A in it, but I know many people who slacked off. They did not actually read the book, and did not learn hardly anything; yet they will still be receiving the same letter grade as me due to the set up of his class. Hard work and understanding the content do not equate to success in his class. Overall, this class and the professor was just full of disappointment over and over again. :: Used the whole lecture to go over the course material which helped in understanding the content. :: sufficient. :: Ineffective at lecturing and teaching content. :: Dr. Srinivasan was not as effective an instructor as I would have hoped.  Though he gave a good overview of the subject (which is, to be fair, a big subject to cover) I don't feel like I got as secure a grounding in the subject from his lectures alone.  The homework was a good way to see how the concepts could be applied, but I still felt that, in some areas, he could definitely have been more effective. :: Lets TAs do most of the work for him, lectures briefly and then expects students to know what to do.  Class is set up so it is easy to get a good grade and learn nothing.  Almost never responds to emails unless the same email is sent multiple times. :: Decent. :: -. :: Not effective at all. His course was centered around groups. Did not allow people to learn. His 'lectures' were terrible and were very difficult to pull any information from. :: very effective. :: He was fine"
1379,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, the professor followed his expectations that he had listed in the syllabus. He graded according to the listed scales and was good at saying if there were any schedule changes. :: yes. :: His syllabus was very clear on all the grading policies and class policies and he enforced them in class when needed. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes and no.  Dr. S used an online program to grade our book annotations.  This online program was very finicky and often the grades would change without our or his doing. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Nothing deviated from the syllabus, unfortunately. :: The material was graded and weighted exactly per the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Kinda. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: There was no official syllabus, but rather a series of emails that were sent before the semester began. :: Yes, all of our work was graded as expected. :: Yes, he accurately followed hos syllabus. :: yes. :: No, in his class the group matters more than the individual grade. I really got screwed in this class when it came to grading. He did follow the syllabus, but he was not fair at all. He made the quizzes really hard. :: yes, grading followed the syllabus as expected. :: There was no course syllabus to derive expectations from. What was provided instead were a series of emails blanket addressed to the students, which theoretically contained the information that would have been contained within a syllabus. In practice, however, critical pieces of information, such as assignment schedules or the overall grading scale, were not included or included in fractured forms that had to be pieced together, and by having the information separated into multiple locations the difficulty of actually locating the information one was looking for became a much more difficult exercise than it should have been. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The first reflection was not graded according to the syllabus, but subsequent assignments were. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but expectations are extremely low and pathetic. :: Yeah. :: Yes. :: for the most part he didn't evaluate us. :: yes. :: He followed the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.  Course was graded based on attendance of class and completing homework.  Actual knowledge was not necessary. :: Yes. :: The course syllabus and evaluations were very clear, and followed exactly by Dr. Srinivasan. :: Yes. :: -. :: Yes. :: yes"
1380,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The professor started class on time and always used the entire class period. :: he was early every time and used the entire period. :: Always started on time and used the whole class period. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Because this was an 8:00am it didn't exactly start at  8:00 all the time because sometimes half the lecture would be late due to a traffic incident or something. That's not your fault, but it should be considered when half of this course grade is based on attendance. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: We usually started a few minutes after 8 am because the professor had to log on to the lecturer computer and pull up his teaching materials. Also, a lot of students came late to class everyday because it was at 8 am. :: No. :: Yes. :: Class typically started soon after the time it was supposed to, and regularly ended on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He always started on time and used the full time. :: Class started on time everyday and never let the class out early. :: yes. :: He stared on time and finished on time. I felt like that was the only good thing that happened in the whole class. :: yes class time was well used. :: Classes actually did start on time, for the most part, and tended to go the full length. Whether that time was used efficiently is a different question. :: Yes. :: Pretty much. :: Yes. :: always on time and used full period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. :: Wasted a lot of the time through out the period in the beginning of the semester but usually started and ended on time. :: yeah. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: like clockwork. :: yes. :: He usually took longer getting set up, and so lectures often started a few minutes late. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: -. :: Yes. :: yes"
1381,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor showed interest by noticing if table members did not show up and knowing me by name. He also would walk around the tables in the scale up classroom to answer questions, which was helpful. :: He would meet during his office hours or after class and find time for you. :: Always. He would also bring in examples of materials in class so we can physically see what was being talked about in class. :: with in class work he would be engaging and walk about the class interacting with students. :: He always provide power points and notes that help us. :: Not at all!!! Dr. S was very degrading and rude.  When asking him a question his response was usually extremely rude or some sort of snide comment. :: I'm not sure. I would lean towards no. :: He was always there for questions. :: He was not very interactive with students.  did not help when asked to explain a problem set in class. :: I'm actually not really sure. I didn't interact with you really at all this semester. Lack of interaction may be an indication in itself.. I mean I guess you showed up to class so I'll give you that. :: While the class was crucial to my major, however, the professor didn't really make the course interesting. :: Homework reflections and releasing confusions reports. :: Yes. :: He had us fill out homework reflections and he posted the solutions to our homeworks so we knew the correct way of solving the problems. :: He did not. :: He really didn't, he just read off of slides. :: There really was no sign of this. :: During the in class examples the instructor would not explain how to solve the answer from the initial problem. :: He asked us to apply what we learned to real-life examples. :: He would answer emails. Otherwise, he did not seem to care too much. If a question was asked he never actually would fully explain the solution to our misconception or problem. :: Didn't seem to care much, atleast he didn't make an effort to make the learning worse than it had to be. :: was sure to answer questions well and was willing to help. :: He didnât at all, he kept talking during his lecture and when u email him, he never responds at all. Thatâs something that I really didnât like at all. I have emailed him like 100 times and I never received one single respond from him. :: occasionally brought examples/models to class and encouraged slightly more participation than just a regular lecture; however, having been in multiple active learning classes this one was a disappointment. When the opportunity was given to work example problems in groups, LAs were not always aware of what to do themselves, and the class would move on once he had any indication that just one person had gotten the correct answer. The class was mostly lecture despite being described and structured as active learning. :: The instructor seemed to have an interest in the material he was teaching, but I could not say that he had a great interest in the students. In my entire time in the class, I do not believe that we have spoken more than five words to each other. We have interacted so little that I do not even remember the instructor's name, as all interactions, including in the classroom itself, were through a Teaching Assistant. :: Updating pilot with materials. :: More than willing to talk about the course content and beyond. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He didn't, he just read off of a microsoft word document and the TA was of almost no use because his English was almost incomprehensible. :: Very little. :: Didn't at all. :: Very little, showed some applications in further course work, fewer in industry.  The instructor was unclear on many points or seemed to be disjointed in presentation of material.  No drive to have the students learn effectively since he showed little interest in teaching despite hearing of high praise of his knowledge on the subject. :: It seemed like he didn't really care about our learning. :: by teaching class?. :: No. I asked him a question in class; he then looked at me, smiled, and walked away. He then proceeded to just do something else. It made me as a student feel very unimportant to him. :: The class was like a normal lecture where we just learned from a powerpoint slide while he explained everything more thoroughly. :: As much as he could with such a preposterously large class. I think the class would be much better if it was a fraction of the size it currently is. :: An end of the year project relating materials to super heros. :: The class was a bigger one, so little time could be spent on individual students.  I feel like, in a smaller class, he might have been more able to focus on his students, but his style was more based for a larger audience. :: He gave examples of real life applications and brought in visuals. :: -. :: Didn't really. :: being interesting"
1382,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor did not always respond to emails out of class. There were a couple times that I did not receive an email response about a question that I had. :: Yes. :: He was always available during his office hours and responded fairly quickly to emails. :: fairly well, expectations were always understandable, interactions through email would make communication slightly difficult. :: He communicated well. :: The instructor is very nice and friendly and like to help us even out side of the class. :: Terribly.  Dr. S would not answer emails this entire semester.  In the classroom he was often not loud enough and talked with a muffled tone into the microphone. :: He sent out emails about important things. :: very effective. :: in class- rushed through topics, didn't take time to make sure students actually understood the materials, the TAs were about as in the dark as the students and weren't much help either out of class- disorganized, changed due dates and emailed students two days AFTER the revised due date had passed. :: Communicated well. Not an issue of miscommunication. :: It was hard to get a response from the professor outside of class. :: by use of email. :: He was effective in and out of the classroom. :: He did a good job of communicating both in class and through email. :: He was not very clear. :: He just read slides. :: I would not know, I did not try to communicate with him in the classroom or outside of the classroom. :: The instructor did not communicate effectively during the lecture. :: He was rather effective with his emails, but was not very effective with Pilot. :: Iâm class, he lectured well but it didnât seem to be what we needed to know in order to solve the in class problems. He lectured over theory but gave no examples on how to do calculations. I often didnât even know what equations we needed to use. :: I don't know about out of the classroom, but in class he told the class what needed to be done and when the dates were, however his explanations of thing are long winded and mean little without much context on new subjects. :: pretty effectively. :: Not good at all. He always talking the whole time during class time and when I email him outside of class, e never responds at all. This is something that I really hated. :: very effective with email communication, not all that effective with engaging students in communication during lectures. :: Communication was poor. Soft-spoken as he was, it was difficult to hear him in the classroom when his microphone was functioning, and impossible to hear him when it ceased to function, which occurred frequently. Being in a scale-up classroom, it was also extremely difficult to hear over the conversations of students which were supposed to happen as part of the course's proper functioning. Communication outside of the classroom was nearly nonexistent, with the only communications received outside of class being the 'dear students' emails that were sent in place of a proper syllabus. :: Well. :: Always clear instructions. :: Very well. :: Hard to understand him, instructions often confusing. Many emails over the same topic. :: He answered emails very well. Assignments and quizzes were well discussed. :: Mediocre. :: Average. :: Terrible. never responds to email, no communication and allows relayed you to the TA and wouldn't field any questions at all. :: Inside: There was a definite disconnect between instructor and class.  The material was simply presented not taught.   Outside: Way too many emails towards the beginning of the semester.  Consider consolidating the ""Dear student"" letters and schedules into one comprehensive syllabus. :: Never bothered. :: poorly. :: Not very well. I emailed him one time this semester and he never responded. :: Gave us information out of class by email to update us on class information. :: as well as he can be expected to in such a ridiculously large class. :: Communication was attempted in the class room. :: He communicated with a number of emails, and was reasonably effective at communication. :: Very well. :: -. :: Decent. :: very effective"
1383,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course and lectures were very organized. The professor was prepared for the class and understood the material well. :: yes, everything was laid out on pilot. :: Yes, he posted all his lecture slides on pilot and we always knew what was going to be talked about in class that day. :: yes. :: Yes, but most of the class was spent figuring things out with our groups instead of lecturing. :: Yes the material is very organized. and the lecture is very organized. :: not at all.  Dr. S did not prepare well for lectures.  The lecture slides were usually out of order.  Dr. S would assign problems and give us minutes to work on a them. :: Yes? and no, I don't really understand how students are supposed to learn anything in this course. :: yes. :: They didn't really seem like it. :: Very rushed.  Would have been a much better class if we had more time to understand everything. :: I'd like to say that this summer I was very excited about this course, but I'd now like to say that I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Almost all of the resources for this class were online. Persuall and the annotation assignments were probably the worst thing to happen to this class. I actually despise ebooks, and I was very saddened to here that it was required for this course. About 3/4 of the way through the semester and failing almost every quiz, I checked out another edition of this textbook from the library, and I have to say that my understanding of the material significantly increased. I learned more with my sessions with the hard copy of the textbook than with my time on Persuall. I feel like this is the case with several students. You really shouldn't force your students to learn with an ebook, because most students don't have much experience with them, and I don't think it's your place to try and force that upon them during my time in this class. Instead of trying to learn Structures and Properties of Materials, I'm now trying to learn how to use an ebook AND Structures and Properties of Materials. You should just require the textbook, not the form it's offered. I often felt handicapped with this because I learn better with hard-copies but I'm literally required to use it for our annotation grades. The annotations were also a waste of my time. To get a good score on them you had to write about a paragraph for each one, which leads to five per annotation which is the equivalent of a small essay per assignment, which is due like twice a week. These would take me on average about 2 hours to complete, and diverted my attention from the textbook readings. I spent way more time trying to get a good grade on the annotations than I did actually reading the textbook. . JUST STOP USING PERSUALL and assign chapter readings so we can actually digest the material. ***I suggest that you get rid of Persuall and the annotation grades and just highlight specific reading assignments. If the sole purpose of Persuall was to to hold students accountable for the reading assignments, just do a small concept quiz at the end of each class over the readings and lecture. This will hold students accountable for the readings and will actually get them to come to class. AND the TAs might actually have something to do/grade (the TAs were practically useless, they just kind of twiddled their thumbs the whole semester and didn't really help). Also, I think you should do more of a traditional active learning environment. I'm suggesting you restructure the course in this way: 1. Stop the requirement of the ebook and banish Perusall. Just require the textbook for reading! 2. Replace Perusall with assigned readings, and test students on these readings at the end each class with a small quiz. 3. At the beginning of class, spend about 10 minutes working out a group problem that is graded by the TAs (so that way we actually interact with the TAs), and then lecture the rest of the time up to the quiz. 4. STOP DOING CLICKER QUIZZES!!! These had so many issues. Just have them be periodic written tests and have the TAs grade them.. 5. Just have regular homework assignments and stop the ""reflection"" idea. No one sincerely does this.. 6. If you decide to make attendance a grade, you need to include a series of drops in the semester for attendance and other assignments. This way you can stop dealing with people's excuses as to why they were ""late."" (Also, it didn't help that this class was a huge 8:00am lecture, so attendance was highly dependent on traffic and other factors) * I spent a significant amount of time thinking about this because of my level of disappointment. I was actually considering getting into MSE before this course, and the functionality of this classroom made me abandon that idea **. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He had everything ready to go even before the start of class. :: Not at all. :: Yes. :: Yes, they followed the syllabus really well, despite the schedule needing to be changed near the end of the semester. :: No. After only 2 weeks the instructor assigned a reading on a chapter that would only be seen in-depth until november. :: Yes. :: His lectures did not match up well with the in class problems. :: The course content and lectures were never on the same page, the out of class homework never focused on what the lectures were about because they were always 2-3 weeks ahead due to how closely packed they were. :: yes. :: It was not organized at all, we kept jumping all over the place. This is somethings that I really hated. We kept moving from the front to the back of the book and backwords, it was really bad. :: yes the course content was logically organized. :: Organization of the class was poor for the medium in which it was used. I feel that the organization of the class was more intended for a regular lecture hall, and then retrofitted at the last minute to attempt to use the scale-up classroom method. Long stretches of lecturing were suddenly interrupted for the students to do a single problem with minimal explanation of the procedures necessary, and then almost immediately whip-lashed back into lecturing. The Teaching Assistants, which are one of the critical components of the scale-up method's proper function, were often not of assistance, and in some situations actually worsened the student's understanding of the situation. Recitations were quite often a complete joke, and did nothing of actual use for the students, something that the students quickly picked up on. Between all things, the class was an excellent example of a dysfunctional classroom. I would suggest, if you decide to try to tool the class more towards a scale-up design, to contact Dr. Randy Mieskoski from the Physics department. His 'See One, Do One, Teach One' setup has had a great amount of success with scale-up classrooms, and perhaps his method might be of assistance in reorganizing this class. :: Reading assignments did not usually line up with in class materials. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, presented from lecture slides. :: Yes. :: Mildly. :: Average. :: yah. :: Not at all.  Although sorted in a logical way, the content within the each lecture topic was disconnected and did not coney to the students.  The information was presented not taught.  Learned more from other courses and online sources than this class. :: Nope, they were all over the place every single day. :: not really. :: For the most part, yes. :: Yes the lectures were well organized. :: yes. :: lectures were organized except for class work days. :: They were, actually. :: I found it more helpful when Dr. Srinivasan lectured over a particular topic rather than only discussing it in a group setting. While problem solving in a group is beneficial, sometimes its a ""blind leading the blind"" situation. It was hard to find out if our answers were correct during lecture. :: Yes. :: -. :: Sort of. :: yes"
1384,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor did not always respond to emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was always available. :: hard to make an appoint with as both schedules were busy. :: yes. :: Yes he is always available during the office hours. :: No. :: No experience with this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes! Very accommodating!!. :: No, when I would email him questions I wouldn't hear back from him for some time. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: I sent him an email and he never answered back. :: He was available. :: Yes. :: I would not know, I did not use these opportunities. :: Yes. :: He seemed cold and uninviting, but was available. :: Yes however when we asked him questions he didnât fully answer them. :: No comment. :: yes. :: He was not available outside of class, I have emailed him alike a 100 times and sinhave never received one single email alt all. :: I did not personally attempt to reach out to the professor through office hours/etc so I cannot comment on this. :: Availability was low, as his office hours were never actually stated to the students. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No, never responded to any of my emails. :: Yes. :: Partially. :: No. :: No, never online responds. :: Yes. :: didn't contact, cant say. :: I never needed to go to office hours. :: Yes, but the TA was very helpful to where I didn't really need him out of class. :: yes. :: na. :: Yes. :: -. :: yes"
1385,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The professor did a good job of covering the required material. At the beginning of the semester he should go into more detail about how to do annotations and explain what parts need read of the book. He should also make sure to take the time to actually answer the problems that we do in class. For some activities we did in class, it would seem like he would have us do them and then never actually go over the answer. Overall, the professor did expose us to a lot of information about materials and was an organized professor. :: Nothing about Dr. S but the TA I was assigned this semester for recitation and for in class was not very helpful. She didn't understand half of what was going on and she definitely played favorites within her recitation group. I feel like my grade has suffered because she would never come to our table to answer questions or help during recitation. There was one table in particular she stuck to and would actually sit with them for most of the semester. :: nope. :: no, Thank you. :: Dr. S was absolutely terrible and I can say with complete confidence that his teaching is not effective.  Throughout the semester Dr, S and his Learning assistants have been extremely rude and degrading to everybody.  this class has taught me nothing at all and i hope to never have to take his class again.  He needs to be fired for being incompetent.  My learning assistant was terrible and was rude.  he routinely called us stupid and would not help out when asked. :: Kimia was the worst LA ever. She confused me even more. Told us wrong information multiple times and spend 30 minutes per recitation looking at her laptop trying to figure out how to solve the problem. Was not prepared and did not have enough knowledge to LA for this course. :: Nope. :: Overall, I'm disappointed. Please read my long comments above and take them into consideration. I've spent a significant amount of time on that because I actually care and was troubled about this course in general. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. Thanks for reading. :: N/a. :: He was good. :: I think the class was fair except for the computer grader for our annotations. When using clickers on quizzes I would have liked to see my answers to all the quiz questions side by side with the correct answers to the quiz questions. That would be more meaningful to me than just a grade. I also did not like having to buy a digital copy of the book. I prefer paper copies so that I can make notes in them of things that I think are important. The online book was cluttered with everyone's mandatory comments. :: No. :: His LA's were highly ineffective. They did not have basic knowledge of the material covered and were difficult to understand when they did have answers. :: His TAâs seemed more confused than the students often times. Also, things were never well explained. It left his students very confused. :: no. :: This class was really bad, he talks all the time in the class and when u have a question, he never responds at all. I felt like this class should be an online course. I didnât like this class at all, he always made me feel that I wanted to sleep. Also his accent made it hard to understand. The group work matters much more than the individual grade. :: the class would be better off restructured as a lecture class, because that's how it was taught but not how it was graded/activities were planned. I did however like the concept of group and individual quizzes, and how the homework was discussed in groups and then reflected on rather than graded for accuracy. The main issue I had with the class was the very high grade weighting on Perusall when the material was going to be lectured on in the next class anyway; there was little motivation to do the reading and hardly anyone did the reading, just did enough annotations to get the grade. That 20% of the grade depended on this seemed ridiculous to me; I believe there should have been much more weight on the quizzes and less on Perusall. :: This class was quite possibly the worst class I have experienced at Wright State. My reasoning for this is listed below. A large portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were annotations of the textbook, which was required to be purchased through a particular third-party site. These annotations were extended response sentences, and were intended to make the students analyze the material to gain insights into what the text was covering. This wasn't a particularly bad idea in theory, but the implementation of the concept left much to be desired. All grading of responses was done by the third party website's automated grading algorithm, with the 'best 5' responses determining the student's grade on the assignment. Those with a knowledge of what software is currently capable of would realize that algorithmic approaches to parsing English sentences is a seriously difficult task, which still has not been adequately solved by dedicated research teams. As such, there were serious holes in the algorithm that were quickly identified and exploited by the students. There were multiple instances in which students would annotate vocabulary words within the section, and respond with a definition pulled directly from an internet search for the word. These responses would receive full marks for the assignment, despite not actually having any analysis of the material done on the part of the student. Additionally, due to the minimum responses required for an assignment, giving actual analytical answers became a time consuming process, while students who exploited the system were finished in under ten minutes, and often with better grades. All of this was visible to the student body, as the annotations were public to those within a student's division of the class, which equated to about one sixth of the students in attendance. Another significant portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were homework assignments. There were five assignments across the semester, with half of each grade being completion, and the other half being a guided reflection sheet designed to encourage self-analysis, and also act as a feedback measure to the faculty. The problems came in that there was no actual accountability required in the process. Assignments were not checked for correctness at any stage along the process, meaning that students did not receive feedback as to whether or not they had properly understood or implemented the concepts. There was often little support in the actual lectures for the calculations required in the assignments, with the lectures focusing almost entirely on theory and disregarding calculations, which left students to fend for themselves in trying to learn how to complete the assignments. There were multiple instances of dishonest behavior when completing assignments, with at least one instance in which a student was taking answers for their homework off of Chegg, (a website designed for copying answers for homework,) directly in front of a Teaching Assistant. No comment was made by the TA, despite looking directly at the screen as the student worked. And with the reflection sheets, which were supposed to act as a feedback measure, that feedback was never visibly acted upon, and I seriously doubt that any of the feedback given within them (including some of the problems listed in these paragraphs!) ever reached the instructor. Across the board, there was not a great deal of respect on either side of the student-instructor division. For a Sophomore level course, seating in the classroom was fully by assignment, and attendance was mandatory at 15% of the final grade, with no allowances for missing days due to situations such as sickness or family emergencies. The instructor did not trust the students to organize themselves to learn efficiently, simultaneously removing the ability of the students to form into effective groups, which is a vital component of the scale-up methodology. Additionally, he had to resort to forcing attendance through grade manipulation in order to make students attend class, instead of making attendance actually worthwhile in learning the material. Whether or not the instructor actually disrespected the students isn't quite as important here as the perceived disrespect by the student body, which they reacted to. Students would attend lecture, and complete their homework for other courses, as they knew that trying to pay attention would not actually teach them. Recitations were far worse than lectures, and one of the most chilling moments was the complete silence as the TA stood by the board, with nearly every student in the recitation section working on other things, including but not limited to: Assignments for other classes; Crosswords; Video Games; Social Media; and Professional Accounts such as LinkedIn. This silence continued for nearly three minutes, in which the students were physically present, but not mentally present.  The students do not have a high opinion of the course. In an informal survey of about 20 students in the course of 110, not a single one had a positive reaction towards the course, and over half of them stated that it was the worst course that they were taking this semester. This was coming from students who were also taking courses such as Physics II, Calculus III, or Differential Equations. Over half of them admitted to doing other coursework during the class, and the vast majority of those surveyed stated that they did hadn't really learned anything. Now, this was only a sample of the class, and most of them shared a recitation course, but the overwhelming response received is concerning, to state mildly. As for my own personal thoughts, this course has been of little help to me. This course has taught me little more than what I could have learned from buying a textbook and studying independently for a semester. Doing that would actually still have been more beneficial, as afterwards I would still have a textbook available for reference, something that I will not have after this class due to the required purchase of an e-book from a limited-time third party site. I have learned more of the material for this class from its sister class, Metallography, than I actually have from the lecturing for this class. Will I pass this class? Quite likely so, and that is what concerns me. If I can pass this course not actually knowing the material I am supposed to learn, then other students in the class are going to advance with a similar or lower level of knowledge, knowledge we are supposed to know when we continue on to other classes such as Thermodynamics. Even if I do not fail this course, I feel that this course has failed to provide me with the knowledge I have paid time and money to learn, and that is what upsets me the most. This is not meant as an attack against the Instructor or the Teaching Assistants. I feel that outside of the classroom, you are likely all decent people. What I have attempted to convey with my words above is the state of the classroom as it appears from the student's perspective, in the hopes that what I have seen can help to fix the multitude of problems that still exist. I hope that it is of some use, and that changes will actually be made, as I would not wish this class in its current form upon anyone. :: My TA was incompetent in recitation and never knew the answers to any questions we had. I don't feel the structure of this class allows students to learn the material. I believe there needs to be a restructuring of this course if you want students to learn. :: Dr. S is a good teacher and deserves to stay where he is at. :: This class would benefit from being a classical lecture, the ""Scale Up"" program does not seem to fit well. :: Rework the whole classroom. :: Worst teacher I've ever had, I wouldn't even consider him a professor. :: No. :: the class should not be so large. :: na. :: I didn't enjoy the way the material was taught and the use of annotation homework. It felt like annotations were added simply to add time. :: -. :: Stop groups. :: no"
1386,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He's an amazing instructor. He has profound knowledge in what he's teaching. :: He was effective when he used the boards and wrote notes. While he was explaining things that were covered in the book they  were not very clear and were not understood until the topic was covered several times. :: average. :: Overall, he was very effective teaching this course. :: Class time needs to be something besides answering the questions on perusal, this is not helpful.  The day that the chapter of the book was missing and you had to lecture, I actually understood that material more than any other section in the entire semester.  I personally learn so much better from lectures/powerpoints/worked out problems than by discussing the images in the book.  Also the book has so many grammar and spelling errors that it made it difficult sometimes to understand what the book was trying to explain. Many times the book would reference a homework problem or figure that did not exist.  The annotations did not help in my learning, I found myself working the system to make sure my annotations were equally spaced so that the computer would like my comments. :: Very effective, however I feel there were a few aspects of the class that slowed my understanding of the material, described below. :: GREAT."
1387,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, he did. :: Dates and deadlines were alter quite frequently throughout the semester. Based on the work evaluations were mostly fair. :: yes. :: Yes he evaluated my work based on the expectations in the syllabus. :: The first few quizzes were reasonable with multiple choice questions and minimal short answers. The last quiz was completely different format with no warning on changes. It would have been nice to know of the quiz format changes due to taking the quiz to potentially prepare better.  The homeworks are very difficult especially with no problems worked out in class time. Would have liked to have similar problems to homework worked out in class to understand the homework better. I feel that the homeworks were so hard that I did not really learn anything from it and many times did not even know where to start on the problems even with help from the internet and the book. :: yes. :: GREAT"
1388,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, He's good in Time Management. :: He typically used the entire period. :: yes. :: Yes the class pretty much always started on time and always went the full period or over. :: yes, always used entire period and many times went over, and never understood if we had another class after his. :: yes. :: YES"
1389,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Certain things are obvious to interpret, and one of them is that He want every student to feed on his knowledge. So he would ask questions, interact with students individually and correct our misconception. :: He didn't actively take interest. :: he would help students with their questions until they understood the material. :: He always asked to see if we had any questions. He also looked at the questions in the annotations and answered them in class. :: would come over and help with homework problems when completely lost on where to start the problem, but then would leave us stranded and make us decifer what the book was trying to explain even when the book did not help. :: He made a point to spend more time emphasizing topics that we had trouble with. :: SOME WHAT. THE CLASS STRUCTURE IS HARD TO GET USED TO."
1390,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 9 (Both in and out of classroom). :: He tried to send out emails when he made changes to the course schedule. For our final project it was not clearly defined and more then half of the class thought it was a research paper rather than a powerpoint until a week before it was due. :: good. :: He was very good at communicating both in and out of the classroom. :: took days to respond to emails, but would sometimes (not always)  answer them in class time. :: very effectively. :: YES"
1391,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, it was well organized. :: No he never came into lecture really knowing what he was going to lecture over. :: no he just read out of the book. :: Yes the course content and the lectures were well organized. We always had something that we were going over. :: no. chapters were missing in the book. Annotations were late being posted on perusal so the entire semester kept getting delayed leaving limited days to work on term project. Seemed as if lectured were just based off the questions on perusal and were never really planned about what was going to be talked about during class. :: Independently they were. However, when viewed as a whole, I had trouble connecting the lectures with the text. The reading assignments were pretty densely packed with information, and I feel I didn't get much out of the reading assignments because of that. I feel that had we covered the material in lecture before we did the reading assignments, I would have been able to better learn the text in context, and used it as a tool to elaborate on the finer details of the topic that I had already become familiar with through lecture. With that said, Dr. Srinivasan definitely emphasized improving our understanding of the material, and was flexible in conducting the course to accomplish that. :: I WISH THERE WAS MORE CONTENT WRITTEN ON THE BOARD DURING CLASS. MOST OF THE CLASS IS STRICTLY LISTENING, WITHOUT MUCH CONTENT."
1392,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes off course. :: Never went to talk to him and I never email him for anything. :: yes. :: Yes the instructor was always willing and available to help. :: yes. :: YES"
1393,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Yes, he's an amazing professor, we are lucky to have Dr. Srinivasan as our Instructor and as our Adviser. :: The scale up class room is not an effective learning style unless the students can sink numerous hours in to the material a day. This is not possible for most undergrad students because they work and typically take 4 other classes along side this class and a equal or greater in difficulty. If just reading the book was an effective means for the majority of students then there would not need to be a person to teach the course. :: the format of the class with the annotations and leaving students to teach themselves was not effective. It required hours to read and reread the text and going to google before I started to understand. The time dedicated to this class took away from the other classes I was taking. :: There are multiple things I did not enjoy about this class. I hated the flipped classroom aspect where we are just supposed to ask questions in class to get answers. Sometimes it's hard to bring up questions when you don't understand the material enough. Reading the book and doing annotations was also terrible. I understand the point to an extent. It did help me some of the time but honestly I think I could have learned significantly more if Dr. Srinivasan would have actually taught the class. There were a few times where he lectured and I learned more on those days than I did reading the book by far. I also hated Perusall because of the way it graded the annotations. It's also very hard to create 5 annotations for like 8 pages of material and 4 of the pages contain figures and images. It is hard to have them all evenly spread out and if you don't spread them out enough, you get docked points which I do not believe is fair. I believe this class is a very important class for materials students especially since it is very relevant when working with metals. I'm disappointed by not learning more and better understanding the material from this class and I was extremely interested in this class. Another thing I did not enjoy with this class was that the homework was unbelievably difficult. Many times it was hard to find the answers in the book if it had the answers and it did not really help my understanding of the material. I think this is because we never did any example problems and never got a chance to see how to solve these problems. One final thought is that I DID NOT like how the last exam (or quiz as he calls them) we took (not the final) was worth more than all our other exams/quizzes combined. Our first 4 quizzes were worth 10, 20, 20, and 20 points for a total of 70 points. Our last exam was worth 75 points and the entire format of the exam was changed and he did not give us any warning that the exam style would be different. This severely hurt my grade in the class because it was weighted so heavily and I was not properly prepared for the exam. This has been a very frustrating class from the beginning to the end.  Overall, I do not believe the flipped classroom style is the best way to teach this class, annotations need to be done better, homework needs to be better, and he needs to communicate a little better about exams/quizzes if things are going to change and if they are going to be so heavily weighted. :: FORMAT OF CLASS COULD BE CHANGED A LITTLE, BUT IT WAS GOOD LEARNING AT THE SAME TIME."
1394,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was overall very effective,. :: Dr Roberts is outstanding!. :: Great. :: Dr. Roberts covered various aspect of being an engineer. Unfortunately, I feel that I did not learn anything new from what I had learned from a coop.  I had learned the writing guidelines from the Tech Com class. :: i. :: good. :: Kept our team on track in weekly meetings, made sure we were putting in work via lab notebooks, and all around made the capstone class a lot less daunting by breaking it up into multiple parts. :: I enjoyed class with Rory.

1490,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Did a good job conveying information on Machining principles. :: Instructor was not effective at all. Lectures were terribly put together and very hard to understand. :: hes good prof. :: Terrible- his idea of teaching is bringing up a a slide, picking one word out (i.e. feed rate), verbalizing that one word and moving on to the next slide. When he does an example he will slide through it as fast as possible and say "" da da da da da"" as he scrolls through the steps. doesnt explain any steps or any reasoning behind why he did the steps. Class is pointless. Tests are only difficult because we  all have no clue what we are doing and cant learn anything. Book is also useless. :: Useless. :: Okay. :: largely ineffective in teaching the materials that are presented. :: Great guy, not the best professor. :: worse than awful. :: Dr. Lieh would often get distracted and get off topic. He cared for his students, but class time was not always well spent. :: Not effective. :: Effective. :: Not Effective. :: 5/10. :: Excellent. :: ok. :: very good professor. :: There was to much material covered to be of any real world use. He did the best he could to explain different topics but without any real experience with the equipment sometime the variables used in calculations were unclear as to why they were that value. The book wasn't very effective at clearing up issues either."
1491,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, was willing to go over a problem we were stuck in and how to do do well in project. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus some what, but would not post grades which is unacceptable for the cost of class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Somewhat yes. :: Hard to say considering the syllabus was incredibly vague. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes the syllabus was followed."
1492,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Professor routinely ended class 30 minutes early. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes started and ended on time.
1493,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Did a lot in covering mechanical vibrations in machining and the economics of machining principles. :: He did not. :: yes. :: no. :: No. :: good. :: hard to tell, mainly wanted to instruct about his experiences and why we should do school the way he did. :: Asking interesting questions in class. :: he didnt. :: Not really, lab was much more interesting. :: He didn't. :: the way of teaching. :: somewhat made the class interactive and provided real world applications. :: Dr. Lieh wanted to teach us everything he knew about the topic. If we had question, he would answer it with applicable knowledge and experience. :: no. :: good at leaching by having in class problems. :: Gave in class assignments so that we would come to class to get the points."
1494,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did well in communicating with students about questions we had given the textbook we used was not the best. :: Instructor has terrible communication skills. :: yes. :: terrible, didnt know any of my grades. cant use pilot like every other old teacher. :: No. :: good. :: not at all. :: Pretty well. :: not effective at all, due dates were just randomly announced and changed frequently, very chaotic environment when it came to organization. :: fairly well. :: Not a good communicator. He is very unclear and scattered about everything. Expectations were not always clear. :: Email. :: communication was pretty poor. :: Out of classroom: N/A In classroom: 7/10. :: not. :: good. :: There were allot of rude international students that would talk over him constantly that was frustrating sometimes."
1495,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, the lectures were actually better than the book in terms of organization. :: No, the course was shotgun style and you never knew what was going to come up next. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: moderate. :: Organized but not effective. :: Yes well organized but a very ineffective teaching strategy was used. :: No, he would get off topic a lot. :: No. :: Somewhat yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Organized in power points and then posted them to pilot."
1496,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: not really, took days to respond to email. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he did. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes I missed a day and he meet me to give them to me."
1497,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- For the future, a better machining textbook would help since it seems the machining textbook we used had much errors and was horribly disorganized. :: Dr. Lieh is a terrible professor and should not be teaching any course at WSU. I wish I could be refunded for this course because I have learned nothing and have had my time wasted. :: Retire. :: No. :: class time is really boring. Shorter note and more small practice so student learn bit by bit. After that they can do a full problem. :: This class was not worth paying for, if it wasn't for the lab portion this would have been a complete waste of time. The in class portion taught me absolutely nothing. :: no. :: No. :: no thank you. :: no. :: Thanks for the good semester. Drop the grinding chapter since we don't use one in the lab and the section on shapers."
1498,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. Very unorganized. I had no idea when assignments were due or what assignments to do as their due dates seemed arbitrary. :: Not good. :: He is by far the most useless professor I have ever had. Unprepared is too good of a word for him. It seems as if this is the first time he has taught the course, yet when looking on wings express I found he has taught the course SEVERAL times. I cannot even begin to find the words to express his mediocrity. :: Ineffective. :: Not very effective. :: awful I often left more confused after class and he is unorganized and this harm the students. :: Dr. Lieh's capstone class was much more difficult than the classroom section of senior design should be. We spent the first half of the semester completing assignments and going over topics that did not relate at all to the senior design projects, and the second half rushing to finish our proposals. We never were given a specific set of requirements for our assignments. Instead, he would act nonchalant about the assignments and then grade them very harshly. Most of the time in the classroom seemed wasted, as it would have been more beneficial to just get that period to work on our own projects. :: This is the most ineffective instructor I've had in my 121 credit hours of higher education. Why does he teach here?. :: the instructor had some issues applying the guidelines for the class at first and didn't really post things on pilot on a regular basis. :: Moderately effective, I feel the instructional pace could have been quicker, which would have left more time for working on projects and assignments. :: reasonably effective. :: He's not. No one ever knew what was due, when it was due, and what was going on. I still don't know what I was supposed to get out of that class.  He didn't have a reliable syllabus. The only reason we knew to turn something in was by word of mouth.  His grading.. it's laughable. I'm 93% sure he just randomly chooses a number - much like I just did with the 93%. He didn't inform us of ANYTHING related to our senior design project. We didn't even know we were supposed to find a project by emailing professors until the second class. By that time, all the good projects were gone. :: OK, COULD BE BETTER"
1499,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Course seemed unnecessary. Lab work on the actual projects was more important than lecture time. :: Kind of. :: He constantly changed due dates, often completely forgetting what his syllabus said. Before the Thanksgiving break, he changed a due date to the following Monday after break. He made this change two days after our assignment was due, after the vast majority of the class had already submitted their assignments. :: No clue because grades were not uploaded to pilot so i have no clue what my current grade is. We received graded papers back but he would change things or give extra credit so in the end you wouldn't know what your grade was. :: There were no concrete expectations outlined in the syllabus. :: no he would constantly make up assignments and change due dates and course work. :: He would assign things, but he would give us no outline or rubric and then would grade them very harshly because we didn't do it the way he wanted even though we were never shown how it was supposed to be done. For our proposals, he would just say to first turn in a baby proposal and then at the end of the semester turn in an adult proposal. We did that to the best of our ability given the lack of instruction on what was expected, and our grade suffered mightily because of it. :: Absolutely not. His expectations were very unclear. I only ever knew what was due because I heard about it from other students. He very rarely posted assignments on pilot, or wrote them on the board at least. But then when we turned in what we thought he wanted, we'd get low grades because it was missing things we didn't know we needed. I have a 4.0 GPA, so I know how to pay attention, follow instructions, and complete assignments if I have guidelines. How am I supposed to complete assignments that I don't know exist or I don't know the guidelines? I once emailed him back and forth 5 times asking for guidelines for a paper, and only after harassing him for an entire weekend did he post something. This is a class that should be dedicated to our final project, but it was impossible to keep Dr. Lieh pleased. :: yes. :: Not really. Assignments were graded on criteria that were either vaguely alluded to, or not even communication to the students. Grading was inconsistent. He did however give us opportunities to correct assignments. I understand that letting students fail then teaching them through correction is a method sometimes used, I find it to not be conducive to learning and a waste of time. I didn't learn anything by not being able to practice concepts and procedures, then wasting time by doing the assignment twice. :: somewhat. :: YES"
1500,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: He would routinely go on tangents, talking about the American Dream, speaking about how hard work and determination would help you sell yourself to the real world. What this had to do with Gantt Charts and risk management, I have no idea. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no he showed up late rather often. :: Yes. :: Yes, but one time he fell asleep. I have a picture to prove it. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: YES"
1501,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Lieh was helpful in passing along beneficial information to assist in developing future projects. :: He brought in lots of guest speakers. :: If it's possible to have lost brain cells and intelligence from having sat in his class, then I'm sure it's happened to me. :: He didn't, he would rather talk about himself and his accomplishments. :: he did not show any interest in students learning. :: No. :: He demonstrated no interest. If he were interested, he would've been more clear about assignments and easy to work with when asking questions. :: he talked about the multiple projects that engineers work on and how beneficial those projects will be when completed. :: by allowing us to correct assignments. :: yes. :: NOT AT ALL. HE IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THE TOPICS DID NOT INCREASE MY INTEREST IN BECOMING AN ENGINEER."
1502,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Did not clearly indicate expectations for class, nor assignment due dates. :: Poorly. :: Abysmal. He refused to use pilot, stating ""it never worked for him"". And when he did use pilot, he only used to news section to make posts. This meant that no notification went out to alert students to when he made an assignment. The only way to have knowledge of his posts is to have been looking at pilot at the right time. Then when class starts and we had no idea that he wanted us to do something, he would get angry and rant about how pilot is trash and how he never wants to use it. Any suggestions given to him on alternatives for how he could communicate differently were shot down in flames. :: Awful, I never knew what was going on and honestly I don't think he did either. :: Poorly. :: awful, when I went to his office hours to ask a question he responded with ""come to class and youll find out"" even though I had not missed a class previous to this and met him during his office hours. :: He would respond but wouldn't answer the question you had. :: Terrible communication. Was hard to get an email response out of him, and didn't make assignment due dates or expectations clear in class. His accent is difficult to understand, but if he could at least write assignments on the board that would help, or utilize pilot. A lot of times he'd dismiss class, and then while everyone was packing up and leaving, he'd start talking about assignments or writing things on the board. At that point, no one can hear or they're leaving. :: unknown. :: not well, I understood probably 2/3 of what he said because of the language difference. :: the instructor communicated somewhat effecitvely. :: HA!. :: NOT GOOD. BAD USE OF PILOT AND EMAIL, IN MY OPINION."
1503,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. Class seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. Lab time for each group would have been more effective. :: Not at all. :: As I am sure you can infer from previous statements made, organization is not Lieh's forte. Tangents, asides, and branching off are the only way that he knows how to communicate. It was far too often that he would be speaking and I would have to look at someone and ask ""how is this relevant to anything"" only to be met with ""I have no idea"". :: No, completely random, in the end he just filled class time up with guest speakers that I did not find useful for class time. The speakers were good and I learned new things from them but I could have done that on my own time and he could have used class time to maybe teach us something that we could use for senior design. :: No. :: No. :: No. :: Absolutely not organized. The course is supposed to be dedicated to completing our senior design project, but the course content did nothing to help with the design, plan, construction, or anything to do with the project. And often times he'd end up on a tangent about unrelated things. :: it could have been organized in a better way. :: organized, but not helpful. While I did enjoy and learn from the guest speakers he invited, most of the core course material was a repeat of topics and tasks I had learned and been doing my entire time in college. A lot of the course time could have been better spent directly supporting the Capstone project or used as work time. :: somewhat well organized. :: I don't know how to answer this question. What course content?  Nothing was organized, this whole class is a mess and waste of time.  We could have been given time to actually work on our project, but no that would actually benefit us. :: NO. VERY RUSHED."
1504,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Kind of. :: I never want to have to encounter Lieh outside of the times where I am in his class. So I cannot comment on how his office hours were. But that statement itself should be loud enough to show his ineptitude. :: Yes. :: Moderately available. :: No. :: Fair. :: Nope. See any of the other answers above. :: unknown. :: yes. :: yes. :: KIND OF."
1505,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I recommend immediate termination. :: I think this class needs to be restructured, not worth paying for if this is what I get out of it. :: Dr. Lieh should organize his course more and put more material and standards on Pilot. :: he is the worst professor I have had the misfortune of having class with. He shows no interest in teaching or the students and repeatably singled students out and tried to embarrass them. Due to his actions he hindered our groups senior design project from the start and continues to do so. I believe keeping him as a teacher is harming WSU student's education here. :: no. :: Junghsen Lieh is not an effective instructor and caused much stress without getting anything useful out of it. :: the teacher should post things more on pilot than just saying stuff in class. :: Though the instructor was engaging in class lectures. Overall very nice person. Responded to questions when I needed to ask him. Just wish some of the assignments were more clearly defined as to how they will be graded instead of being more open ended. :: What I learned in this class: Lieh had 7 years of straight A's. :: STRUCTURE OF CLASS COULD BE MUCH BETTER. GUEST SPEAKER ARE NICE THOUGH."
1506,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Effective. :: Most of class time is spent with him explaining things from the book with little to know worked through examples. It makes lectures hard to follow and little information can come from them. :: A very intelligent instructor, but wasn't very effective on me. The class made me more frustrated than anything.  He had a very busy schedule outside of class made it very hard to schedule times to meet with him. :: Dr. Slater is very smart. However, he could teach the class more if he would stop trying to impress the class by telling them how smart he is. Bragging on your self is a wast of everyone's time. Dr. Slater knows plenty enough to impress the class by doing examples in class so they better understand the material. :: good"
1507,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, i hope so. Graded fairly. :: Yes, I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. :: yes"
1508,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Started class on time and often went over class period by 5 or 10 minutes. :: Yes, He did go over class time regularly. :: yes"
1509,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Was available for consultation and addressed all questions. :: Mostly just talks. :: Encouraged us to come to his office hours, however it was very difficult to schedule a time to meet with him, because of his schedule. :: Yes, I think he enjoys learning and wants us to learn as well. :: yes"
1510,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Effectively. :: Fine. If you send an email he responds. If you ask a question he answers it. :: Email mainly, but getting a response often took a day or two which was frustrating. :: Dr. Slater was fairly responsive to helping us even with his schedule. However sometime response seemed vague. Also too much class time was spend on him telling about all of his accomplishments. PLEASE DO MORE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. 30 MIN PROOFS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A WAST OF TIME. :: good"
1511,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Not particularly. It feels like he explains things with the assumption that you already know the material and that you are looking to learn more, which is not the case. :: Could of been organized a little better. Manuscript used for the course was often incomplete. The manuscript he gave us did not follow the course content given in the lecture outlines. Equation numbers were different as were page numbers and chapters. Lectures just consisted of him reading notes and equations off his manuscript. Wasn't very helpful. Never went over any examples in class or anything like that. The lab portion of the class was very unorganized. We were never properly shown how to use the lab equipment. A lot of times the equipment didn't work.  We had to learn on the fly how to work it. The lab instructions were very plain (a sentence or two long). :: Yes. However, PLEASE DO NOT USE SLIDES FOR ENGINEERING CLASSES, that is what they do in are history class. :: well good"
1512,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. He misses a lot of office hours but if you want an appointment he is available. :: He was late to appointments in his office hour. Scheduled office hour at a very difficult time for the class to meet. Wasn't very flexible with this. I asked for a tutor or someone i could consult with during the week to get help with the material and he said ""there is no one else who can teach you this material other than me and a guy that doesn't work here."" We took our first exam in September and didn't get it back till over a month later in November. Actually i never received a grade back until about the 10th week of class which is ridiculous. Turned in homework but got no feedback on anything. :: Yes. :: well ok"
1513,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I believe this course is a very difficult class to take let alone teach. Being my first 7000 level class i took as a graduate student i don't believe i really had the prerequisites to take it. I think there should be a class or two before with material to prepare you for the material in this class. Overall a very difficult class. Much different than undergrad vibrations. Class was taught much different. Undergrad class didn't prepare me much for it.  I believe this class wasn't well organized, the instructor clearly knows what he is talking about with the content, but teaches it to us as if we have been studying it as long as him. :: Overall I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. The criticism should be taken as things that should be addressed. But, not that he is a horrible person. I think he would be a great teacher if he made the changes listed above. :: please provide some video lectures."
1514,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- I couldn't follow anything this guy was talking about all semester. I kept trying and I kept rewatching the course videos, but could never follow for any significant length of time. Maybe I'm just an idiot. :: 3 out of 10 Teaches using Powerpoint and that sucks. :: He clearly knew what he was talking about but did a very poor job conveying the material. :: Lectures are not too graduate driven. At times effective but at other times really confusing. :: Dr. Huang is one of the best professors at explaining concepts that I have had. :: His teaching style improved greatly when he begun working out problems on the board. His slides were sometimes difficult to comprehend. :: no comment. :: Dr. Huang is very passionate about what he teaches. He conveys concepts well verbally, but does NOT give students clear understanding of what is expected of them. He rushed through material very quickly toward the beginning of the semester. By the schedule set in his syllabus, we were well over halfway through the class before the halfway point of the semester. Dr. Huang's lectures are largely disorganized, consisting of frantic circling of notes on a projector. People began to cease attending lecture because, based on how the class was run, there were no notes to record. By the end of most classes, students left unsure of what they were supposed to know that day. :: Sometimes difficult to follow, but that might have more to do with the time of the day the class was. :: This class was taught at a level that seemed beyond the scope of what an undergraduate class should be taught at. Granted many of the students in the course were graduate students, many of the concepts were things that have never been taught before. It was hard to follow along with what was going on because the level of complexity of this class. Many students had trouble understanding the concepts and how to do the projects. :: Very effective and informative lecture sessions. :: Powerpoint slides were helpful, and lectures gave a good understanding of concepts. :: He covered a most of the required material but didn't teach us any code but required that we submit our projects in a coding language no one knew, it was not optional what language we could uses. :: He is very knowledgeable and has a lot of personal experience with the topics discussed. Sometimes, that can make him think the topic is easier than it is. A book might make some of the topics easier to understand or reference later. :: not bad. :: good. :: overall effectiveness of the instructor is good because he describes the topic very well but examples are not solved in class after the completion of topic. :: A very effective teacher, in my opinion. :: good. :: He is best. :: Dr. Huang is very effective"
1515,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Super hard grading and assignments. Unfair is a good word to describe it. :: Maybe?  We never got any graded reports back so your guess is as good as mine. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but I think including an example report could help demonstrate what the projects are supposed to look like. Also, I'm aware feedback could be retrieved on request, but this would have been helpful if it were more accessible. :: no comment. :: The course syllabus is red herring in regards to the class expectations.  There is no written homework for this class. There is no book. The number of written examples done in class could be counted on one hand. The syllabus suggests that use of the software Mathematica and Matlab would be used for numerical analysis. This is absolutely false. The only software this course uses for it's numerical analysis is Fortran, and the software for plotting data is Tecplot. The professor has students use a computing language they have never seen to run high level, complex numerical analysis. The professor supplies code which students must modify to produce some output specified in his ""projects"". Projects make up 50% of the grade. Consequently, students do not learn about Computational Methods in this course because the class does NOT evaluate understanding of Computational Methods. The class does, however, test our ability to modify files in an obsolete computing language that the class, even by the end of the class, cannot understand. The remainder of the grade for this class is written exams. Students have no examples to try on their own because there is no book. And because there is no written homework, how are we supposed to do a written exam problem when the only thing we are graded on is our ability to modify code we can't understand? The class should have been based around Matlab--the software we are all familiar with as undergrads since we've had a course in it. :: Yes. :: I believe the instructor graded fairly based on the expectations given. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not on the first exam, He did not clearly explain to us the requirements. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: I guess instructor didn't evaluate our work because his grader does this job and he is not that perfect in grading. :: I am not sure.. a TA grades everything. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1516,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes, but not always the full period. :: Usually ended a bit early, but always started on time. :: Yes. :: Yes,. :: Normally, but technical difficulties got him more than once. :: no comment. :: He routinely started at 6:30, the class start time. He routinely ended class early when he realized he was way too far ahead of his syllabus schedule. :: Yes. :: The class often started on time, and the instructor would be in the class room the entirety of the class period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he typically started on time. :: We were ahead of schedule and left early some days. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, instructor did start the class on time but he finishes it early and didn't utilizes the full time because he covers the topic very fast without solving any examples in class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Started class on time, sometimes ended a bit early (that's OK with me)."
1517,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He told me he couldn't help me when I went to his office to ask for help because I couldn't form a specific enough question. :: He had a lot of office hours and always made sure everyone knew what was going on before continuing to the next thing. But the people that didn't understand never spoke up. :: He showed an intense interest in the course material. :: Got very emotional in the subject matter at times which made it seem more interesting at times. :: He is clearly very passionate about the subject and would do his best to make sure we understood. :: no comment. :: He asked questions about our understanding of the lecture. No one could ask questions because the lessons were reinforced via Dr. Huang's complex Fortran code. The only pertinent questions that could be asked were about Fortran syntax. At one point, this class becomes less about Computational Methods and Numerical Analysis (already a difficult subject) and far more about Fortran. :: He often repeated that he wanted us to understand this material because it will be helpful. He gave us lots of resources and materials that he believes will help us later in our career. I appreciate the time and effort he gave to prepare the materials he provided. :: Projects were challenging and driven towards real life applications. He tried to fit as much content as possible into the course so that we would have a lot of tools and experience upon completion. :: Available in office hours and via email regularly. Office hours were helpful in getting me to understand how to solve projects without being given the answer directly. :: He told jokes to wake us up. :: You can tell he is excited about the material and likes teaching it. :: not much. :: good. :: Yes, if i consider teaching he teaches the subject very well and his lectures were very interesting. But, again he didn't taught us the Fortran and was difficult to solve his projects because they were all based on Fortran. :: Dr. Huang knows fluids quite well. This knowledge is apparent as he is very enthusiastic about teaching us. :: very good examples. :: He add practical problems in assignment. :: Very good about answering questions and taking time to explain any difficulties in class."
1518,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Seemingly effective enough for other people in the class, but I had a lot of trouble learning anything from him. :: Well enough. Could be better could be worse. He gave us a retake on one of our midterm problems because of a miscommunication on his part. :: Not very effectively in the classroom. :: Not well, He seems nice but the grad student seemed to be in charge of that. :: Fairly well. Sometimes it could take a couple days to receive an email response though, other times it was very quick. :: no comment. :: Fine. He's a nice person, well-intentioned. He offers to make himself available as any professor with office hours does. Again, lessons are about Computational Methods, but the grade comes from implementing it in Fortran. Which students could not do. :: Sometimes difficult to follow. Admitted when he was wrong though. :: I never had to communicate with the instructor outside of class, but from others I heard he was available during his office hours. In class he would answer any questions people had. :: Very effectively. :: Effectively. :: Sort of effectively. :: Good. :: good in the classroom. :: 9/10. :: Yes, he communicated very well. :: Quite well. :: good. :: Better. :: Dr. Huang communicated effectively"
1519,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The notes were also very hard for me to get anything out of. They were confusing and I never felt like they led me anywhere. Just a bunch of information that was difficult to link together. It's like I missed a pre-req or something. :: Sure. :: The content tended to be slides with unexplained equations with undefined variables, while the code given out as a base to do the projects with was entirely uncommented leading to an excessively long time working out what each part actually did.  In most cases I was unable to fully understand the code or why it worked.  I was able to change small parts of it but commenting what each part did would be really helpful, especially since we are expected to comment what our changes do. :: Somewhat, he got extremely ahead of schedule which made the first midterm cover way too much material. :: They were fairly well organized. :: no comment. :: No. They jumped around. He would change subject constantly during lecture. This was another reason why people could not produce logical notes. :: Sometimes difficult to follow. :: To an extent. He had prepared notes, and knew exactly what he was talking about. Sometimes it was unorganized, but rarely. :: Very well. :: A bit more explanation into fortran syntax would've been welcomed, but not absolutely necessary. :: It was a little scattered. :: Yes, but a book may have helped. :: lecture videos werent. :: yes. :: Yes, the course content and lectures were well organised. 9 out of 10. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1520,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The TA was super helpful when I came to him with my issues. Dr Huang, on the other hand, told me he was unable to help me because I couldn't form a specific enough question for him. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I didn't go to office hours but from what I have heard with other students he was available. He was very difficult to get a hold of online. Again the grad student seemed to be in charge of all of that. :: Yes. He even scheduled meetings on the weekends to help me understand things. :: He held office hours. My understanding is people could not get the information they were looking for communicating via email (and they were only emailing him with questions about Fortran syntax). Most people relied on the TA for help with Fortran. :: Didn't try. :: Again, I never had to contact the instructor outside of class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never tried. :: yes. :: the TA wasnt mch helpful. :: yes. :: Yes, he was reasonably available. :: Yes, it was easy to see him at his office hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1521,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Look man, I'm sorry I couldn't follow you as well other people in this class. But seriously, you could have tried to help me. I know didn't make it to class often, but it was honestly because it was so hard for me to follow your trains of thought that I found it more productive for me to use this class period to eat my dinner (my second chance to eat on tues/thur after 8AM and before 9:30PM) and then watch the lecture videos on MWF. I watched all the lecture videos until you stopped uploading them, but it was still hard for me to learn a damn thing. Seriously, it felt like I missed a pre-req. :: Stop with the power point. It's awful. Write everything step by step. We are not all as smart as you are. Go slower. :: Comment your code.  I don't care if you know what it does and what you're doing, I need to know what it does so I can complete the assignments.  Just because a project is simple doesn't mean its easy, that's why Prandtl is famous. :: No. :: Please make using FORTRAN optional. I get it that compiler based languages can be very helpful to know, but we aren't taught that prior to the class and it puts students at a disadvantage and makes the course unreasonablely difficult for something that is not a key objective for an understanding of computational methods. :: no comment. :: I understand that George Huang has Fortran code that he has published apparently, and this is why he uses it in class. However, as powerful and impressive as the code is, students can't read it, manipulate it, or understand it. 50% of our grade comes from doing exactly that. This class would be FAR more effective in teaching computational methods if it used Matlab. Perhaps Dr. Huang cannot use Matlab and so chooses not to teach with it. This class NEEDS to have someone look into what's going on. It needs to change. Many students feel threatened that they won't graduate because they can't interpret Fortran.  Students are not learning about the course subject. Why does WSU require a Matlab course (a numerical analysis program for mechanical engineers) when the Computational Methods and NUMERICAL ANALYSIS course used a completely different software? If the college is dead set on using this language, please require a course in using it. This class as it is run is, without a doubt, setting students up for failure. :: Only two gripes: 1. TA should not be grading the exams 2. Record all lectures, even if using the whiteboard (the audio only would still be helpful to refresh memory). :: This course is complex. I feel it should be strictly a graduate class. If this class must be a required course to graduate, it should not be so complex. This class seems like it should be the part 2 of a course, where the first part would be an introduction to Fortran, and simplified examples. :: If possible recording the audio on the last group of lectures would still be helpful even though the majority of material was covered on the white boards. Having the recorded lectures proved very useful for both projects and exam review,. :: None. :: Students in the future should be allowed to use matlab, which the students understand, or Fortran should actually be taught. :: no. :: Yes, just want to inform that he should give and solve the examples in class after completion of the topic. :: no. :: No. :: No."
1522,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. I have a lot of material in my notes that should prove useful in my career. :: Very effective, but covered a lot of material very quickly which made it hard to keep track of all of the intimate details. :: Fantastic, she knows the material and conveys it in a way that is easy to understand. :: she is very organized with the topics and explains them clearly. :: Dr. Huang is a great instructor and I have learned a lot from her class. She is very good at describing the details and has extensive knowledge of the subject. :: a good teacher, very nice and kind. explain everything well. :: GREAT. :: Very good, I learned a lot. :: Prof. Huang is good teaching from the basic points to core part of the topics. :: Very effective."
1523,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes she graded very fairly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes the instructor stayed on schedule with the syllabus and everything for the class has been in it. :: yes, she is very fair and more than that. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
1524,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Always right on time and lectured until the end. :: yes. :: always. :: Yes. She always started class on time and we stayed the entire class each day. :: yes, the instructor did the timing perfectly. :: ALWAYS. :: Yes, she was always a few minutes before the lesson started in class to always start the class in time. :: yes. :: Yes."
1525,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- I emailed her about jobs in the energy material field and she met with me in her office. :: She actively checked with the students before moving on to new material. :: yes. :: she encouraged student participation by asking questions as she was teaching. :: She always tried to find interesting ways to convey the information and also related it back to other classes that were previously taken. :: yes, i learned everything in this class very well. :: VERY MUCH SO ONE OF THE BEST INSTRUCTORS I HAVE EVER HAD. SHE DOES HAVE A HABIT OF GOING THROUGH MATERIAL TO FAST. :: She provided me with additional information for my presentation and also always had a few minutes of time after each lesson for answering personal questions. :: more practical applications, in class quiz, and other activities. :: Always gave us her time to help us with our questions."
1526,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- quite effectively. :: Easy to talk with in the class room and easy to find in her office. :: yes she always answered questions quickly and effectively. :: always available after class for concerns. :: She did an outstanding job communicating both inside and outside of the classroom. :: she did very well, she would give you her time if some student can't meet class time and office hours. :: GREAT. :: Good. :: yes. :: Always available through email and office hours."
1527,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Very organized came in most days and knew what we should be covering that day, did not have to change the course schedule at all this semester. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. She was always well prepared and organized for each lecture. :: yes. :: Yes the schedule was clear and we always knew befor each lesson what it was going to be about. :: yes. :: Yes."

1529,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- One of the best teachers I've had. :: one of the best professors I have had here at WSU. :: She is a great professor and I truly enjoyed her class. :: she is amazing and everything in the class was understood perfectly. :: One minor issue regarding formulars (which slightly improved throughout the semester)  Whenever a new formula was brought up, not every single variable was explained by her in detail. So I was sometimes a bit confused about which numbers I had to plug into these formulas. :: No."
1530,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- She was very kind and always smiling, however, some of the concepts were a little abstract. :: Sometimes she is vague in the lecture and then expects depth of understanding on the tests. It is hard to figure out what is important to understand for this class. :: Effective, discussed relevant information for both the class and real world applications. :: Poor. :: I will rate 6 out of 10. :: She is very good at teaching the concepts using practical examples and goes into insights of subject as well. :: Very effective."
1531,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I think so, there wasn't really a notification on what your grade was in the class unless you asked her in office hours. :: I feel like the topics in the course syllabus were followed, but that objectives were not clearly established.   It seemed like we had to guess what to study. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1532,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes.

1533,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes. :: She gave us practice problems that clearly helped us learn, but they didn't seem to be connected to the tests. :: Always set aside a little time right before class to discuss any confusions as well as making sure all questions were answered to satisfaction. :: Not applicable. :: 7/10. :: The topics are more in practical applications which were taught in creative way by the professor. :: Yes."
1534,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: I really liked that she helped us to see how equations are developed and kept relating them to simple situations. I think she had coded messages in the lectures about what to study instead of being direct. :: Very effective.  Emails were sent to confirm any change discussed in class. :: Very poor. :: Good. :: Yes the communication is good. :: Alaways available to answer questions by email or during office hours.
1535,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- sometimes, I did learn a lot but it was difficult to follow. :: The course content seemed well organized, however the lectures seemed to touch the surface, while the tests expected depth. :: Yes. :: No. She kept going back and forth. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yeals."

1538,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Clear instructor. Organized lectures were very effective (either aligned with book or slides online). Examples in class helpful to highlight important concepts and build intuition. Recommendation of practice problems from end of chapters made clear what was expected for exams. :: She was very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in the students learning. :: she was really thorough with subject tried to help in every aspect of our studies. tried to clear doubts everyway possible and even tried to teach some basics where i felt left behind. :: She usually maximize the time allocated for the class, trying to cover a lot. :: She is so efficient in teaching.

Then she divided the whole syllabus into terms, so whole class felt like the subject was easy to learn. Then she started asking us questions from our basic courses and this made the class even more interesting."
1542,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: At the start of every class she went over announcements and questions. :: she was very helpful. :: Very Okay. :: She is so friendly to make conversation both in and out of classroom.

1545,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great class!. :: she is one of the calm and very understanding teacher i have met in my life. thanks. :: She should pay more attention to helping students with clarifications during her office hours and not give the student an impression to feel scared of coming for her office hours because she will always refer the student back to the textbook, that way it looks as if the student didn't read it the first time before coming to her office for help. :: She is an awesome instructor and I really learnt a lot from this class"
1546,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- very effective and is able to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. :: Mrs. Mirmasoudi is an excellent professor.  She introduces concepts that are not required, but she knows are very relevant to real world applications.  Her depth of knowledge in the subject is very impressive. :: Professor Mirmasoudi was very effective in class. :: Shw was a very good instructor at teaching the concepts for the class.  She kept the large class on task and organized.  All of the concepts we taught effectively. :: very good. :: SHE IS THE BEEEEEEST. :: Good Class, learned a lot. :: The class is very effective and a lot of content is introduced. :: Okay. :: Good. :: The class material was clearly presented. Nothing was too repetitive, and things sped up as expected as the overall Solidworks skill level increased. The progression was very effective. :: I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi did an excellent job of instructing this course as I was easily able to learn the material due to her teaching methods. Also, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. :: The overall effectiveness of this instructor was outstanding. She described every step she took and she would always make sure everyone was caught up and understanding what she was doing. :: Her teaching style is very effective and helpful. :: She was very thorough and she was very helpful. she did everything she could to make sure that we understood what we were doing. :: Very effective and full of information. Fantastic teacher!!!!. :: She was a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell she knew what she was talking about. She was typically very clear with instructions as we followed along, but sometimes she went too fast for people and we had to wait to let them catch up. The one part that she did not make as clear was the written portion of the class. We spent lots of time on the practical portion of the class, which is important and much more interesting, but not much time was spent on learning or reviewing the symbols and markings which are very important."
1547,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes all the grades were graded fairly and were evaluated just as the syllabus said. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, design task grading was sometimes unclear,  but was consistent. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was graded fairly, except for the first design task.

She was very good at giving fair grades and being understanding about questions."
1548,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: always. :: Yes class was always on time and the full class period was often used.  We were supposed to have lab time built into part of the class and sometimes that was a little lacking because the concepts and features she was teaching ran long. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the class time was used appropriately. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class was always started punctually, and any excess time was used as lab time. :: Yes to both. :: Yes, we always started on time and used every minute of class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes very routine. :: Yes. We started within five minutes of class starting almost every class and used the full time.

Her interest in learning is seen in her lectures. :: Being excited about content. :: Yes. :: The instructor personally checked on the different stages of the chair project, and also asked questions regarding learning progression throughout the semester. :: If a student was having any issues with a certain topic, she would make sure to go back over that material to ensure that everyone was learning it, and these issues were alleviated. :: She always asked if everyone was caught and always asked if everyone was understanding what she was doing. :: She would continuously ask if everyone was caught up and working well. :: The class itself was very interesting so it was easy to pay attention. :: Yes she sparked a fire in to learning more about solidworks!. :: She did well at answering questions and making sure we kept practicing what we were learning with applicable assignments."
1550,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well. :: Very effectively. :: She was always very quick to respond to emails and was almost always available after class for questions. :: She was very good teaching and explaining tasks and due dates and often emailed to clarify due dates, explain tasks further,  or answer problems that arose. :: very well. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well. :: Communication was the only area early on that was somewhat lacking. There were a few deadlines that were different in class versus on pilot, and the sample report was never posted. This led to some less than ideal grades on early assignments. But later in the semester, communication was effective. :: As previously stated, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. That included the timely reply of emails and then communicating the content of these emails without saying who emailed her, to ensure that no other students were having the same issues and if so to address these with them as well. :: She was great at answering questions in class and also emails whenever someone had a question out of class. :: Very effectively. She listened to everything you discuss with her and remembers it. :: very well. :: Very well!. :: She was very good at answering questions in class.

The course progression was logical, and every design task was assigned after the appropriate material was covered. :: Yes. :: Yes, both the content and the lectures were very organized. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes she had them planned out!. :: Yes. She did well at giving design tasks that followed along with what the lectures taught."
1552,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Mrs. Mirmasoudi was always willing to help or direct students to help. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, although I typically asked the TA's because I sat next to one in another class. :: Yes, through both office hours, appointments, via email. :: Yes, she was always willing to help whenever she could. :: yes. :: All the time. :: Yes. :: Yes. She usually answered emails within a day or two. She did not hold office hours, but the TA's were very helpful and friendly during their office hours."
1553,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Overall a very good professor, she is a little difficult, but I fell like a learned more than the other class on solidworks applications. I would recommend her to beginner engineers looking to learn a lot and who are passionate about the field. :: Maybe have dimension sheets or follow along sheets for students while teaching a lesson they can see things without having the teacher go back and re-explain and take extra time, or the student get lost and fall behind because they missed some dimesnions when they were fixing a problem or touched a wrong button.  Also some students do not have drafting and CAD experience and the class takes off pretty fast assuming everyone has the experience. :: no. :: No. :: Mrs. Mirmasoudi warmed up to the class after a few weeks. Her teaching style is very immersive and benefits students in the industry,. :: No. :: I would have loved to cover more material with the implementation of a much faster pace, although I understand why this would be a difficult addition. I like more intense material, otherwise tend to focus on other classes, which is why the most difficult design tasks were my best grades. So an intense lecture covering a large amount of materiel would be perfect for students like me. :: I felt that Mrs. Mirmasoudi not only taught me how to use SolidWorks, but also how to utilize it for resumes, interviews and future careers. With that being said, I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi went above and beyond what was required of her in order to teach this course. :: She always cared about making sure we fully understand what she did and always wanted us to learn more. :: no. :: Fantastic Teacher!!!!!"

At the end of each class she spends like ten to fifteen minutes for questions. Also when we are out of the classroom the best way to reach her real quick is email. she responds immediately."
1559,Shanee Pacley,2017 Fall,ME 4730,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I think she could use a little more organization. I feel that she would lay things out well in the syllabus but once class started she seemed to get a little rushed and skip things. :: Could use improvement. :: They were okay but could have been a little better. :: yes. :: Yes the lectures were usually well organized. :: yes. :: Well organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: This class was one of the most organized ive seen. :: Yes. :: the course content and lectures were perfectly organized and the continuation for each of the chapters made perfect sense.

1577,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Great course. I learned a lot about the field and Dr. Menart's love for the subject comes through.  This is the sort of treatment that I joined the RCL program to see. As far as areas for possible improvement go, it seemed that the course pacing was a bit uneven, with lots of extra time spent on a couple of chapters, as compared with the syllabus, and a couple of chapters left uncovered. One change to speed up the early material would be reducing the time spent coaching the use of Excel. There are many numerical tools out there and graduate students should be expected to bring a toolbox with them to a 7000-level class.  However, I expect that Dr. Menart is drawing on previous experience here and perhaps the coaching is necessary. One compromise might be some video instruction on Pilot that the students could access outside of class. :: I shall definitely look forward for my future courses with Dr. Menart. :: no. :: Nope, he's the best!"

1585,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The end pf semester content was well executed, the tests given during class had issues being too long, and the directions provided with the mini-projects could have been clearer. :: No. :: Just that I feel the course name should change to Aerodynamics. :: Some homework problems and exams required the use of charts and tables that werenât explained during the course of class.

At times effective but at other times really confusing. :: Dr. Huang is one of the best professors at explaining concepts that I have had. :: His teaching style improved greatly when he begun working out problems on the board. His slides were sometimes difficult to comprehend. :: no comment. :: Dr. Huang is very passionate about what he teaches. He conveys concepts well verbally, but does NOT give students clear understanding of what is expected of them. He rushed through material very quickly toward the beginning of the semester. By the schedule set in his syllabus, we were well over halfway through the class before the halfway point of the semester. Dr. Huang's lectures are largely disorganized, consisting of frantic circling of notes on a projector. People began to cease attending lecture because, based on how the class was run, there were no notes to record. By the end of most classes, students left unsure of what they were supposed to know that day. :: Sometimes difficult to follow, but that might have more to do with the time of the day the class was. :: This class was taught at a level that seemed beyond the scope of what an undergraduate class should be taught at. Granted many of the students in the course were graduate students, many of the concepts were things that have never been taught before. It was hard to follow along with what was going on because the level of complexity of this class. Many students had trouble understanding the concepts and how to do the projects. :: Very effective and informative lecture sessions. :: Powerpoint slides were helpful, and lectures gave a good understanding of concepts. :: He covered a most of the required material but didn't teach us any code but required that we submit our projects in a coding language no one knew, it was not optional what language we could uses. :: He is very knowledgeable and has a lot of personal experience with the topics discussed. Sometimes, that can make him think the topic is easier than it is. A book might make some of the topics easier to understand or reference later. :: not bad. :: good. :: overall effectiveness of the instructor is good because he describes the topic very well but examples are not solved in class after the completion of topic. :: A very effective teacher, in my opinion. :: good. :: He is best. :: Dr. Huang is very effective"
1595,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Super hard grading and assignments. Unfair is a good word to describe it. :: Maybe?  We never got any graded reports back so your guess is as good as mine. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but I think including an example report could help demonstrate what the projects are supposed to look like. Also, I'm aware feedback could be retrieved on request, but this would have been helpful if it were more accessible. :: no comment. :: The course syllabus is red herring in regards to the class expectations.  There is no written homework for this class. There is no book. The number of written examples done in class could be counted on one hand. The syllabus suggests that use of the software Mathematica and Matlab would be used for numerical analysis. This is absolutely false. The only software this course uses for it's numerical analysis is Fortran, and the software for plotting data is Tecplot. The professor has students use a computing language they have never seen to run high level, complex numerical analysis. The professor supplies code which students must modify to produce some output specified in his ""projects"". Projects make up 50% of the grade. Consequently, students do not learn about Computational Methods in this course because the class does NOT evaluate understanding of Computational Methods. The class does, however, test our ability to modify files in an obsolete computing language that the class, even by the end of the class, cannot understand. The remainder of the grade for this class is written exams. Students have no examples to try on their own because there is no book. And because there is no written homework, how are we supposed to do a written exam problem when the only thing we are graded on is our ability to modify code we can't understand? The class should have been based around Matlab--the software we are all familiar with as undergrads since we've had a course in it. :: Yes. :: I believe the instructor graded fairly based on the expectations given. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not on the first exam, He did not clearly explain to us the requirements. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: I guess instructor didn't evaluate our work because his grader does this job and he is not that perfect in grading. :: I am not sure.. a TA grades everything. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1596,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes, but not always the full period. :: Usually ended a bit early, but always started on time. :: Yes. :: Yes,. :: Normally, but technical difficulties got him more than once. :: no comment. :: He routinely started at 6:30, the class start time. He routinely ended class early when he realized he was way too far ahead of his syllabus schedule. :: Yes. :: The class often started on time, and the instructor would be in the class room the entirety of the class period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he typically started on time. :: We were ahead of schedule and left early some days. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, instructor did start the class on time but he finishes it early and didn't utilizes the full time because he covers the topic very fast without solving any examples in class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Started class on time, sometimes ended a bit early (that's OK with me)."
1597,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He told me he couldn't help me when I went to his office to ask for help because I couldn't form a specific enough question. :: He had a lot of office hours and always made sure everyone knew what was going on before continuing to the next thing. But the people that didn't understand never spoke up. :: He showed an intense interest in the course material. :: Got very emotional in the subject matter at times which made it seem more interesting at times. :: He is clearly very passionate about the subject and would do his best to make sure we understood. :: no comment. :: He asked questions about our understanding of the lecture. No one could ask questions because the lessons were reinforced via Dr. Huang's complex Fortran code. The only pertinent questions that could be asked were about Fortran syntax. At one point, this class becomes less about Computational Methods and Numerical Analysis (already a difficult subject) and far more about Fortran. :: He often repeated that he wanted us to understand this material because it will be helpful. He gave us lots of resources and materials that he believes will help us later in our career. I appreciate the time and effort he gave to prepare the materials he provided. :: Projects were challenging and driven towards real life applications. He tried to fit as much content as possible into the course so that we would have a lot of tools and experience upon completion. :: Available in office hours and via email regularly. Office hours were helpful in getting me to understand how to solve projects without being given the answer directly. :: He told jokes to wake us up. :: You can tell he is excited about the material and likes teaching it. :: not much. :: good. :: Yes, if i consider teaching he teaches the subject very well and his lectures were very interesting. But, again he didn't taught us the Fortran and was difficult to solve his projects because they were all based on Fortran. :: Dr. Huang knows fluids quite well. This knowledge is apparent as he is very enthusiastic about teaching us. :: very good examples. :: He add practical problems in assignment. :: Very good about answering questions and taking time to explain any difficulties in class."
1598,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Seemingly effective enough for other people in the class, but I had a lot of trouble learning anything from him. :: Well enough. Could be better could be worse. He gave us a retake on one of our midterm problems because of a miscommunication on his part. :: Not very effectively in the classroom. :: Not well, He seems nice but the grad student seemed to be in charge of that. :: Fairly well. Sometimes it could take a couple days to receive an email response though, other times it was very quick. :: no comment. :: Fine. He's a nice person, well-intentioned. He offers to make himself available as any professor with office hours does. Again, lessons are about Computational Methods, but the grade comes from implementing it in Fortran. Which students could not do. :: Sometimes difficult to follow. Admitted when he was wrong though. :: I never had to communicate with the instructor outside of class, but from others I heard he was available during his office hours. In class he would answer any questions people had. :: Very effectively. :: Effectively. :: Sort of effectively. :: Good. :: good in the classroom. :: 9/10. :: Yes, he communicated very well. :: Quite well. :: good. :: Better. :: Dr. Huang communicated effectively"
1599,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The notes were also very hard for me to get anything out of. They were confusing and I never felt like they led me anywhere. Just a bunch of information that was difficult to link together. It's like I missed a pre-req or something. :: Sure. :: The content tended to be slides with unexplained equations with undefined variables, while the code given out as a base to do the projects with was entirely uncommented leading to an excessively long time working out what each part actually did.  In most cases I was unable to fully understand the code or why it worked.  I was able to change small parts of it but commenting what each part did would be really helpful, especially since we are expected to comment what our changes do. :: Somewhat, he got extremely ahead of schedule which made the first midterm cover way too much material. :: They were fairly well organized. :: no comment. :: No. They jumped around. He would change subject constantly during lecture. This was another reason why people could not produce logical notes. :: Sometimes difficult to follow. :: To an extent. He had prepared notes, and knew exactly what he was talking about. Sometimes it was unorganized, but rarely. :: Very well. :: A bit more explanation into fortran syntax would've been welcomed, but not absolutely necessary. :: It was a little scattered. :: Yes, but a book may have helped. :: lecture videos werent. :: yes. :: Yes, the course content and lectures were well organised. 9 out of 10. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1600,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The TA was super helpful when I came to him with my issues. Dr Huang, on the other hand, told me he was unable to help me because I couldn't form a specific enough question for him. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I didn't go to office hours but from what I have heard with other students he was available. He was very difficult to get a hold of online. Again the grad student seemed to be in charge of all of that. :: Yes. He even scheduled meetings on the weekends to help me understand things. :: He held office hours. My understanding is people could not get the information they were looking for communicating via email (and they were only emailing him with questions about Fortran syntax). Most people relied on the TA for help with Fortran. :: Didn't try. :: Again, I never had to contact the instructor outside of class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never tried. :: yes. :: the TA wasnt mch helpful. :: yes. :: Yes, he was reasonably available. :: Yes, it was easy to see him at his office hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1601,George Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4010,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Look man, I'm sorry I couldn't follow you as well other people in this class. But seriously, you could have tried to help me. I know didn't make it to class often, but it was honestly because it was so hard for me to follow your trains of thought that I found it more productive for me to use this class period to eat my dinner (my second chance to eat on tues/thur after 8AM and before 9:30PM) and then watch the lecture videos on MWF. I watched all the lecture videos until you stopped uploading them, but it was still hard for me to learn a damn thing. Seriously, it felt like I missed a pre-req. :: Stop with the power point. It's awful. Write everything step by step. We are not all as smart as you are. Go slower. :: Comment your code.  I don't care if you know what it does and what you're doing, I need to know what it does so I can complete the assignments.  Just because a project is simple doesn't mean its easy, that's why Prandtl is famous. :: No. :: Please make using FORTRAN optional. I get it that compiler based languages can be very helpful to know, but we aren't taught that prior to the class and it puts students at a disadvantage and makes the course unreasonablely difficult for something that is not a key objective for an understanding of computational methods. :: no comment. :: I understand that George Huang has Fortran code that he has published apparently, and this is why he uses it in class. However, as powerful and impressive as the code is, students can't read it, manipulate it, or understand it. 50% of our grade comes from doing exactly that. This class would be FAR more effective in teaching computational methods if it used Matlab. Perhaps Dr. Huang cannot use Matlab and so chooses not to teach with it. This class NEEDS to have someone look into what's going on. It needs to change. Many students feel threatened that they won't graduate because they can't interpret Fortran.  Students are not learning about the course subject. Why does WSU require a Matlab course (a numerical analysis program for mechanical engineers) when the Computational Methods and NUMERICAL ANALYSIS course used a completely different software? If the college is dead set on using this language, please require a course in using it. This class as it is run is, without a doubt, setting students up for failure. :: Only two gripes: 1. TA should not be grading the exams 2. Record all lectures, even if using the whiteboard (the audio only would still be helpful to refresh memory). :: This course is complex. I feel it should be strictly a graduate class. If this class must be a required course to graduate, it should not be so complex. This class seems like it should be the part 2 of a course, where the first part would be an introduction to Fortran, and simplified examples. :: If possible recording the audio on the last group of lectures would still be helpful even though the majority of material was covered on the white boards. Having the recorded lectures proved very useful for both projects and exam review,. :: None. :: Students in the future should be allowed to use matlab, which the students understand, or Fortran should actually be taught. :: no. :: Yes, just want to inform that he should give and solve the examples in class after completion of the topic. :: no. :: No. :: No."
1602,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- very effective and is able to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. :: Mrs. Mirmasoudi is an excellent professor.  She introduces concepts that are not required, but she knows are very relevant to real world applications.  Her depth of knowledge in the subject is very impressive. :: Professor Mirmasoudi was very effective in class. :: Shw was a very good instructor at teaching the concepts for the class.  She kept the large class on task and organized.  All of the concepts we taught effectively. :: very good. :: SHE IS THE BEEEEEEST. :: Good Class, learned a lot. :: The class is very effective and a lot of content is introduced. :: Okay. :: Good. :: The class material was clearly presented. Nothing was too repetitive, and things sped up as expected as the overall Solidworks skill level increased. The progression was very effective. :: I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi did an excellent job of instructing this course as I was easily able to learn the material due to her teaching methods. Also, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. :: The overall effectiveness of this instructor was outstanding. She described every step she took and she would always make sure everyone was caught up and understanding what she was doing. :: Her teaching style is very effective and helpful. :: She was very thorough and she was very helpful. she did everything she could to make sure that we understood what we were doing. :: Very effective and full of information. Fantastic teacher!!!!. :: She was a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell she knew what she was talking about. She was typically very clear with instructions as we followed along, but sometimes she went too fast for people and we had to wait to let them catch up. The one part that she did not make as clear was the written portion of the class. We spent lots of time on the practical portion of the class, which is important and much more interesting, but not much time was spent on learning or reviewing the symbols and markings which are very important."
1603,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes all the grades were graded fairly and were evaluated just as the syllabus said. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, design task grading was sometimes unclear,  but was consistent. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was graded fairly, except for the first design task. There was no example template uploaded, but the task was evaluated based off the ""uploaded template"". :: Yes. :: Yes, she told us what she expected from us and that is how she graded our assignments. :: yes. :: Yes. :: To a T!. :: The design tasks were not too difficult and the TA's were very helpful in terms of asking questions. She was very good at giving fair grades and being understanding about questions."
1604,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: always. :: Yes class was always on time and the full class period was often used.  We were supposed to have lab time built into part of the class and sometimes that was a little lacking because the concepts and features she was teaching ran long. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the class time was used appropriately. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class was always started punctually, and any excess time was used as lab time. :: Yes to both. :: Yes, we always started on time and used every minute of class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes very routine. :: Yes. We started within five minutes of class starting almost every class and used the full time. Sometimes she planned a partial class so that we could have the remaining portion to work on a project and ask questions about the assignments which was very helpful."
1605,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- she would come to anyone that needed help and offer advice so that they could move forward in their work. :: Yes,. :: yes. :: She was very good about relating how the information was relevant in the working field and showed how the concepts in class applied to teh working field.  This is what kept my interest. :: by helping us whenever we needed it. :: Yes. :: Mrs. Mirmasoudi was helpful and understanding. However, she was strict. Her interest in learning is seen in her lectures. :: Being excited about content. :: Yes. :: The instructor personally checked on the different stages of the chair project, and also asked questions regarding learning progression throughout the semester. :: If a student was having any issues with a certain topic, she would make sure to go back over that material to ensure that everyone was learning it, and these issues were alleviated. :: She always asked if everyone was caught and always asked if everyone was understanding what she was doing. :: She would continuously ask if everyone was caught up and working well. :: The class itself was very interesting so it was easy to pay attention. :: Yes she sparked a fire in to learning more about solidworks!. :: She did well at answering questions and making sure we kept practicing what we were learning with applicable assignments."
1606,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well. :: Very effectively. :: She was always very quick to respond to emails and was almost always available after class for questions. :: She was very good teaching and explaining tasks and due dates and often emailed to clarify due dates, explain tasks further,  or answer problems that arose. :: very well. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well. :: Communication was the only area early on that was somewhat lacking. There were a few deadlines that were different in class versus on pilot, and the sample report was never posted. This led to some less than ideal grades on early assignments. But later in the semester, communication was effective. :: As previously stated, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. That included the timely reply of emails and then communicating the content of these emails without saying who emailed her, to ensure that no other students were having the same issues and if so to address these with them as well. :: She was great at answering questions in class and also emails whenever someone had a question out of class. :: Very effectively. She listened to everything you discuss with her and remembers it. :: very well. :: Very well!. :: She was very good at answering questions in class. E-mails were usually answered within a day or two."
1607,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The content and lectures were organized.  I remember there was one design task about reverse engineering a coffee cup that I thoght should have been switched with the design task after that but otherwise the lesson planned followed well so that features were taught in the order of need to build upon them. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The content was organized, it was sometimes hard to follow. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was well organized. The course progression was logical, and every design task was assigned after the appropriate material was covered. :: Yes. :: Yes, both the content and the lectures were very organized. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes she had them planned out!. :: Yes. She did well at giving design tasks that followed along with what the lectures taught."
1608,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Mrs. Mirmasoudi was always willing to help or direct students to help. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, although I typically asked the TA's because I sat next to one in another class. :: Yes, through both office hours, appointments, via email. :: Yes, she was always willing to help whenever she could. :: yes. :: All the time. :: Yes. :: Yes. She usually answered emails within a day or two. She did not hold office hours, but the TA's were very helpful and friendly during their office hours."
1609,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Overall a very good professor, she is a little difficult, but I fell like a learned more than the other class on solidworks applications. I would recommend her to beginner engineers looking to learn a lot and who are passionate about the field. :: Maybe have dimension sheets or follow along sheets for students while teaching a lesson they can see things without having the teacher go back and re-explain and take extra time, or the student get lost and fall behind because they missed some dimesnions when they were fixing a problem or touched a wrong button.  Also some students do not have drafting and CAD experience and the class takes off pretty fast assuming everyone has the experience. :: no. :: No. :: Mrs. Mirmasoudi warmed up to the class after a few weeks. Her teaching style is very immersive and benefits students in the industry,. :: No. :: I would have loved to cover more material with the implementation of a much faster pace, although I understand why this would be a difficult addition. I like more intense material, otherwise tend to focus on other classes, which is why the most difficult design tasks were my best grades. So an intense lecture covering a large amount of materiel would be perfect for students like me. :: I felt that Mrs. Mirmasoudi not only taught me how to use SolidWorks, but also how to utilize it for resumes, interviews and future careers. With that being said, I thought that Mrs. Mirmasoudi went above and beyond what was required of her in order to teach this course. :: She always cared about making sure we fully understand what she did and always wanted us to learn more. :: no. :: Fantastic Teacher!!!!!"
1610,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Provided good content. :: Good when powerpoints were prepared. The problem solving examples were confusing. :: He knows his material and means well for the students. :: okay. :: Was usually unprepared for the class. :: Ok. :: Good. :: kept class engaged. :: Had a hard time explaining how to solve the math problems in class.

1642,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Instructor did well at explaining the functions and safety of the machines. :: Good at explaining but goes into his office when we first try to operate the machines. :: Relatively effective. :: Explained topics well, safety was his priority ."
1643,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He did no grading so this isn't applicable
1644,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes started on time and managed his time to use as much as needed safely. Rushing in a machine shop can cause accidents.
1645,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Made sure we understood what we were doing well. :: gave us tips. :: He gave a detailed description of exactly how to use each machine and was always available for questions. :: I've always loved machining and have access to equipment so I could already use all of the equipment in the shop.

Lab was the only beneficial thing of this machining class. :: no"
1666,John Lawless,2017 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- John had a great lab section, unlike the lecture, where I actually learned the art of machining. His background has clearly been working with machining his whole life but he was very helpful with making sure you fully understand what needed to be completed each day and thoroughly showed us the machines. :: yes"

1690,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. :: okay. :: good. :: Alright he tries but lectures are disorganized and have no real structure to them. I feel as if this class is supposed to be a data analysis class but really is just all over the map with the material that we cover. :: Far below standard, could not have been more disappointed in this course's instruction or lack thereof. Poorly executed, did not seem to care if students succeeded in the course or not as long as they understood what data meant. Fine for theoretical practice, but destroying students GPAs because of your poor quality of teaching is shameful. Kindly stop ""teaching"" because most of our class has this same exact viewpoint of your instruction quality. I hope I never have the misfortune of having you for a teacher again. :: Class felt pointless to attend. Would go over example problems in class, but not give enough time to write them down. The lab section was too large for only 1 TA and 1 instructer to help during the period. :: Not very effective. :: Rough. Notes were extremely hard to read and explanations did little help. :: poor. :: Dr. Jackson can be unorganized at times but overall did a decent job of teaching the subject. He has a lot of practical knowledge which he shares on a normal basis. :: m. :: the worst class in history. he doesn't know anything about the subject waste time and if your student with color you get picked on and have to prove and show everything you do, for example he always ask them to prove there work and question them and blame them for cheating even if they never did. And he  have threaten more than one student that he will report them and he did that with group and he refused meeting with them,then it was proved that the student didn't cheated but used the pilot file like every other student but unfortunately for him if you not white your cheater till proven not. :: He was not very effective. I found it difficult to learn from him because he would go off on a tangent. There were also equations that would have been nice to talk about in class and what they mean. Sometimes we did cover some and sometimes we did not. He was a super nice guy and meant the best but the teaching did not help me what so ever. He said it may have helped to have more LA's and he may have been correct but I am not sure. Our LA did not do much other than when it came to lab help. :: Not very effective. Hard to follow. Lecture material was presented as theory first in powerpoint form--good! However, the slides were moved through too quickly to effectively take notes. Often I would get halfway through writing out a concept or transcribing an equation and realize the slide had changed. This would not be a huge issue if the slides were posted on Pilot, but more often than not they were not posted. Example problems were done from the textbook--also good! However, this presented a couple issues. If an example was worked out on the projector, handwriting became an issue. Work was messy, scattered, or nearly illegible at times. If the solution was presented in a printed out problem, the same issue as the powerpoint slides came up: the example was moved through too quickly to take effective notes. And if we were asked to do the problem individually or as a class, either we were not given enough time or a specific solution was never given beyond ""Johnny got 54, but Bill got 229,001. Okay next problem.."". :: This was class was the most waste of time I have ever experienced.  I have not learned anything from the course.  A huge waste of money as well. :: NOT EFFECTIVE WHAT-SO-EVER.  Class lectures were a complete waste of time.  Nothing was ever really taught, some lectures we were literally told to get out our books and read them.  We then were told to ask questions, he answered NONE of the classes questions, he would try to have us answer each other. (kinda hard to do when no one learning anything.)  He cancelled many classes. HE CHANGED THE WEIGHT OF THE CLASS SECTIONS 3 TIMES!!  Twice the week before finals! His handwriting was so horrible no one could read it. He was so disorganized during lectures no one could follow.  When he assigned homework he never posted it anywhere, he would write it on the board for 5 seconds, then remove it ( no one could read what was assigned). Acted like you were dumb if you asked a question, and would not answer. Terrible class, learned nothing, Glad it is almost over. :: Relatively effective. He makes sure that the students understand the key principles taught in the course in the way that they apply to real life scenarios. His ability to teach students how to solve the problems for the course is lacking however. He's great one on one though. Perhaps he could just go over how to do problems step by step to aid in student ability to work through problems presented on homework and exams. :: Non-existent. It was difficult to learn in this class or even follow what was going on. The instructor rambled incessantly which only further added to the disaster which was ME3600-01. :: The lecture were very boring.  It seemed like he took a long time on not a lot of material and the students lost interest. On the other hand, he is very willing to listen to any complaints and adjust accordingly. :: Good. :: Dr. Jackson's teaching was iffy at the best of times. Most of the slideshows I got very little out of. It is telling that the most effective instruction in this course came from fully solved problems projected onto the board. He often gets talking about tangential topics that help us little practically or in the course. :: Dr. Jackson taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: Largely ineffective. Lectures are too fast to actually hold any information. Tests are frustrating due to a feeling of being lost for a majority of the lectures. They are fair otherwise. Labs are disorganized. Only having one TA made the labs a mess. :: Dr. Jackson was somewhat effective in his teaching. There never really seemed to be much structure in his lectures, so it was very easy to get lost in his class. :: Dr. Jackson was fairly effective. I thought the first half of the semester was rough because I didn't get a good understanding of the material but as the semester went on Dr. Jackson was very effective in his teaching. :: He was decently effective. :: caring and dedicated professor. Had a rough semester but persevered and did his best teaching job. :: i barely understand what he says in class. :: The overall effectiveness of the instructor was quite poor. I consider this primarily a consequence of the class format. With 60+ students sitting in a room in Student Success Center, all facing different directions (half of them not facing the instructor), trying to learn math heavy material from a lecturer, to expect any kind of effectiveness is ridiculously optimistic. I personally consider the MME department's apparent ambivalence for this class's section size, room choice, and text, an embarrassment to the college. :: Not very effective at all. The way the class is designed is not the best, it should definitely be a lecture hall class. The book that is used in the class has a lot of mistakes in it, not helping with the learning of the material at all. Something always went wrong in lab, to the point where the class grading scale had to be adjusted three times due to a lab not going as planned. :: Low effectiveness, lectures were generally ineffective and reading the book provided the same amount of instruction as the professor. :: Not effective. :: very ineffective. :: This instructor was not very effective in teaching the material. We just jumped around to different sections of the book which was hard to follow. Some of the book answers and examples were wrong which made things difficult. Also the things written on the projector were very difficult to read and to follow. He could have done a much better job of Assigning homeworks. He just did them by casual mention in class and never even gave the full details about due dates. :: He covered the material verbally and related it to real world situations from his own experiences which was nice. :: Much more effective at teaching material when going through examples. :: He is not an effective instructor. I did not learn anything from him. I did not understand anything because of the way he teaches. By far the worst professor I have ever had. He goes on rants and does not focus on the topics. He expects the student to know everything. He has favoritism, his favorite students get A's in the labs and the homework. He does not go over problems step by step, if someone yells the right answer, he will move on to the next question. Students have continuously complained about the grading system, the way he teaches, and his overall quality as a teacher. He does not have what it takes to be a professor. Sadly, Wright State has no money to hire a decent professor and begged him to come back to teach. Therefore the students do not have a choice and these evaluations are worthless."
1691,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- No. The syllabus changed twice to alter how much each assignment was worth for the final grade. :: yes. :: yes. :: His syllabus changed quite often. Grading was liking drawing a number out of a hat for homework. :: No. due to lack of preparation and organization, labs were not able to be run, we didnt get our graded assignments back at all, and they were graded harshly but not returned so we never knew what we did wrong. :: No. The syllabus grade distributions changed 3 times within the last 2 weeks of class, making it very difficult to evaluate how well you were doing in the course. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes he did. :: no he changed the grading twice. he told us one of labs is not with much at all. the day of lab we didn't have time he told people to wait because he didn't know what to do. till the last minutes in class then helped them and told them you can satay after class and they didn't stay an a hour after class because he didn't know how to do the lab he need it to see how other student will do it first. then the day after he email us and say that lab worth 14% now. :: For the most part. He ended up changing some things from the syllabus and the weight distribution of the grades. The material was covered like it said in the syllabus though. :: Mostly. Some weighting had to be changed because we essentially skipped a lab we were supposed to do a full report on. This is at no fault of the instructor. Partially faulty equipment is to blame. But this is also due to the fact that we did not have an LA/TA/lab assistant (we needed multiple for such a large lab) present, so the vast majority of the class could not get their equipment to work properly. PLEASE provide more lab assistants or whatever for this class--even if it is just for the lab. It is needed. I would have benefitted. Don't continue cutting funding because your students will suffer the consequences more than anyone else. :: No, more than half way through the semester he changes the grading criteria in the syllabus.  These changes ended up hurting us all not helping us.  Than instead of getting our homework back in class we had to make a special trip to the MME dept. to pick it up.  No feedback on the homework on what we did wrong. :: no. :: yes. :: I really have no idea. I have not received but a couple grades back and have no feedback on anything. :: For the most part. :: well enough. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The grading scale has changed so many times, but it is not completely his fault. One day, our LabVIEW software was not operating correctly, so as a result, he needed to push back one of our labs. When he pushed it back, he changed the amount of work that needed to be done in that specific lab. Because of this, he needed to change the grading scale so that it would match the amount of work. Overall, our grading scale has changed many times, so the scale in the syllabus is not the same as the final scale. However, I do believe Dr. Jackson is trying to be very fair in the new grading scale, and he is trying to accommodate the needs of the class as best as possible. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson followed the syllabus exactly. :: To a point yeah. :: yes,. :: not at all the time. :: No. Due to delays caused by lab equipment that wasn't functioning, the final lab requirements were simplified. As a result the instructor altered the weight of each assignment in the class grade. I realize the choice was made in response to unforeseen events, however it borders on unethical to alter the grading structure mid semester. :: Yes, and no, simply because we strayed from the syllabus so much. The grader also did not specify why points were taken off on homeworks. :: It is unknown because as of this time no labs or homework assignments have been graded or returned to any students. :: Sometimes. :: yes, but I would have been more prepared for the evaluations if 60% of every class wasn't spent with him struggling and complaining about the projector. :: No he changed the grading percentages drastically which was not good. He did this more than once. :: He followed and adjusted the grading scale when a lab wont work but other than that he stuck to the original . :: Yes. :: No."
1692,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The professor was routinely a few minutes late to get things started. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Full period used, and more, since he could never tell when he was supposed to stop. :: Yes. :: Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared so class would not really be started even though he was there on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: no we waste more than half of lab because he never ready we skipped multiple lab times because he not ready or he doesn't know how blame CAT. he never prepared for any lab or have good idea of them. :: Yes he usually did. If anything he canceled class but he was having family issues at the time so I would not say it is a terrible thing. :: Yes. :: No, we would start usually 30 minutes late but end on time. :: no. Late to labs often, and cancelled class. :: Yes. Class was always started on time and the full period was used. :: Yes. But this time was largely wasted on explaining nothing. :: most of the time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson always started and ended class on time. :: yes, every class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No the professor was regularly tardy, it was usually only a few minutes late but it was not uncommon for the professor to start the class 10-15 minutes late. :: Yes but not effectively. :: yes. :: Most of the time. :: Yes, expect a few family emergencies that were understandable. :: Yes. :: No."
1693,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Jackson paces throughout the room during lecture, which encourages students to pay attention. He is very receptive to feedback which is greatly appreciated. :: yes. :: good. :: No. :: Nope, couldn't have given a crap less than he did, at zero interest in student comprehension. :: Adding a curve to the first exam. :: Yes. He was more helpful one-on-one with specific questions than teaching to the group. :: Good question. :: no. :: You can tell that Dr. Jackson cares about his students and tries to make sure that the class is taught in a fair manner. :: terrible he made me hate the engineering because his engineering ethic is bad. :: He would try and bring things in lab to help our understanding. :: Nothing particularly outstanding here. :: He didn't.  He made the topics we discussed in class more stressful and harder to learn than they needed to be. :: no. :: He made sure we all took away the important concepts for future jobs. :: Vaguely. It could have been confused with frustration towards our lack of understanding what on earth was going on. :: He related the material to real life scenarios. :: He attempted to answer student's questions, although sometimes it seemed he didn't know what exactly students were asking and answered a different question. :: Dr. Jackson had us work on examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: He attempted to answer any and all questions we had. :: He asked tons of open ended questions in class and was responsive to any questions that we had for him. :: Dr. Jackson would assign problems for the class to work through in class to create an active learning environment and come by each table to offer assistance. Dr. Jackson was also very helpful during office hours. :: Showed a great interest in our learning. :: Always took time for the students and showed care for us as individuals. :: i didn't get much. :: He encouraged participation in class. :: The professor assured us that this material would be beneficial in the workplace and so we should listen. :: Not sure. :: He demonstrated more interest in our learning than he did teaching. :: Yes. :: Applying the material to real world situations, its always nice to see how topics can be applied. The down side is there is so much to cover that sometimes it isn't possible to do it in depth. :: Very caring individual for his students. :: Absolutely not. He did not demonstrate interest in my learning."
1694,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Jackson's written and verbal instructions are often very vague. It is difficult to know exactly how something in the lab should be done or to understand what he's saying when he's explaining a concept in lecture. Often when someone asks a question in lecture, it is not answered directly. :: well. :: good. :: No. :: the absolute worst. responded to emails days afterwards or not at all. :: Overall pretty well, but would cancel class without emailing us. Only posting a note on the class door. :: Out of the classroom he communicated better than in. :: Could have been better with some of the homework assigned as it was very hard to read the written on the computer. :: pretty good. :: Dr. Jackson communicates well, except for sometimes homework assignments were not communicated well enough. I recommend posting the homework to pilot and setting a due date. :: he refused to meet with student after he file academic integrity file. even though wright state clearly say he should have meet with them before that. :: He was hit or miss at times. I think he had a hard time understanding what the questions were. :: Somewhat effectively. Homework assignments and due dates were sometimes unclear.  Reasonable out-of-class communication, although occasionally I would arrive at the classroom to find a note on the door saying class was canceled but no email in my inbox. :: He was not encouraging or helpful. Also would not respond to emails and had only 1 day of office hours. :: no. :: well. :: No. :: Good. :: He was ineffective in communicating many of the points he tried to make. There were many instances where I left classes feeling I hadn't gained anything from the lecture whatsoever. Very poor at explaining how to do problems, or even why we doing them. :: Dr. Jackson used both email and Pilot to communicate well. :: He communicated effectively. :: Pretty effectively. :: Dr. Jackson was very effective in communicating with the students. :: Communicated very well, especially with the circumstances going on in his life at the moment. :: Struggled at times with relaying information to the students. :: i can't say much.. :: Somewhat effectively. It would have been better if he posted the homework assignments online or emailed them rather than just mentioning them in class once. :: He was not effective, examples and review problems were not explained well and would only provide the answer not how the answer to a problem was calculated or derived. :: Not very. :: 3/5. :: Not very well for assigning homeworks and getting stuff posted to pilot. :: He was there for his office hours when I ask and helped me through a lab. Homework assigned in class was the only issue I had, sometimes rude classmates would talk over him and I would miss assigned work. :: Not effectively. Ignores emails and coming to his office hours did not help."
1695,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes but could have been more organized. :: yes. :: No. :: Never, this is not what I paid you for by taking your class. :: Somewhat. When he wrote on the board it was very difficult to understand. His hand writing was difficult to read and he skipped steps of problems. Also he did in class reading, then having students ask and answer eachothers questions. This made him seem unprepared at times. :: No. The material had little sequence and was not presented well. :: Nope. :: no. :: Yes. :: Dr. Jackson stayed on topic pretty well, the only criticism I have is sometimes he did not introduce the topic really well. There were times where I knew what the math was but had no clue what topic we were even on. :: NO. :: I believe they were sometimes. Other times they were not. It was hit and miss. :: Somewhat organized. The schedule was followed very loosely and at times it seemed like there was no plan at all for that particular day. Topics were sometimes random and jumped around a lot. :: No they were not. He hardly had any notes, if he did have notes you couldn't read his handwriting. He also didn't know how to work the technology that was used in the classroom. :: NO. MOST DISSORGANIZED PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD. :: Yes they were. :: They didn't seem to be organized at all. :: Not really. :: He followed his powerpoints. They weren't all that good, but we followed them. :: Yes. :: No. Oftentimes everything felt rushed and all over the place. I rarely felt like I understood what was going on, even on statistics, which was a course I took in high school. Even though I already understood the material, I felt confused each lecture. :: Not exactly. We skipped around from chapter to chapter, and I really don't know why. Looking back on my notes and the book, I think that this class would have been easier if we would've followed the book in the order that it is written. I also think that the lectures were not always the most organized. Most of the time, it seemed like he would come in and just wing it. :: Yes, the lectures were well organized. :: Yes and no, and that's because of lab equipment not working and personal issues the instructor had to deal with, both of which are not his fault. :: Could stand to be more organized. :: not at ALL, the labs wasn't organized he had to reduce the percentage for the last lab report from 20% to 10%, an splits it on exams and hw. :: No. :: No, lecture was always all over the place, and whatever examples the professor wrote on the projector were always very hard to read. :: Very unorganized, specifically laboratories were organized very poorly to the point that one or two labs had to be scrapped and two hours of student's time was wasted because the professor did not attempt the lab himself or did not explain the procedure correctly. :: No. :: absolutely not, but it is hard to tell if it was his fault or the book's. :: No it was hard to follow what was going on. :: Yes very well organized by chapter. :: The lectures lacked structure which hurt me. The book used I felt was not good for teaching this course. There were too many equations to draw from and not enough examples provided in the book. :: No. It was very disorganized and did not make any sense. It displayed how much the professor graded you as to how much he liked you."
1696,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. Unhelpful in the extreme. Don't know what your time was spent in your office doing, but it clearly wasnt grading assignments for speedy return. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was. :: no. :: He was not always in his office hours but he would be if we let him know we would be stopping by. :: Absolutely. Due to an athletics conflict, I had to miss a midterm. Dr. Jackson was very understanding and worked with me to find a time I could make up the exam. No complaints here. :: No, he was not. :: yes he was. :: Reasonably, but he wasn't always helpful. Sometimes consulting the professor left one more confused then when he started. Other times one was told the answer but not explained why. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson was readily available and responded quickly to emails. :: Yes, whenever I needed to meet with him he was available and always willing to meet. :: yes. :: yes. :: He was responsive with emails. :: Yes he was. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. He was never available."
1697,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 3600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: No. :: For the love of all that is holy, if you have even a shred of respect for the students who pay to take classes at this university, either up your standard of operation by an extreme amount, or do everyone a favor and stop teaching. :: The textbook was written very poorly and would recommend attempting to find a different one for this course in the future. :: Dr. Jackson needs more support from TAs, but also needs to refine his lecture material. :: Nope. :: did not get what I paid for. :: No. :: No, overall a decent semester with some hiccups but Dr. Jackson was very aware of that and considerate of that. :: i wish wright state start viewing what he's teaching. :: From my experience with Allen Jackson; I would not take him again and I can't believe the university has kept him as a professor here.  If you're going to fire anyone it should be him. :: HO HO HO, so happy to be getting out of this class. :: Great guy. I just wish he prepared us better for exams. You could do the homework and study really hard and get torn apart on the exams. Many found the wording very tough and the problems took far too much time to solve in the given time unless you knew exactly what to do immediately. I found myself running out of time on exams and getting a bad grade even though I knew what to do. I just couldn't work fast enough. Some did not have this issue however. He was fantastic at making sure that we knew why the work was important.  Overall a great person and someone you can learn a lot from. :: I understand this class was understaffed which created great difficulties for the Professor and although I sympathized, I don't feel this is ample excuse for how poorly this class was run. There were several issues with the lab equipment, but these would not have been as dire if the professor didn't routinely spend 30-45 mins talking before starting lab. This in itself furthered the issues and added frustration. :: Dr. Jackson seems like a pretty good guy, but his instruction is more than a little lacking. This was easily one of the most ineffective courses I have ever taken. I tend to be a straight-A student, but I often struggled even trying to grasp many of the concepts in this class because of the poor explaining. The labs' structure fell apart because of insufficient instructions and poor equipment. If this wasn't a required class, I absolutely would never have taken it. If I had to take it again, I would absolutely look for a different professor. Again, nothing against Dr. Jackson personally, I just can't say that he was an effective professor in any regard. :: Slower lectures and more problems worked in conjunction with the lecture itself instead of just doing them for review would have been very helpful. :: No. :: I heard terrible things about this class before the semester started but now, I don't think the class was that bad at all. I learned a lot and had fun this semester!. :: Appreciated him going through with the class even though he did not have to, especially with what is going on in his life at the moment. He did as good of a job that he could have with everything that was going on. :: The class should be restructured, a different, more correct and clear book should be used, and some of the the labs should be redone, along with the lab manual. :: I would not recommend this instructor to anyone, however since he is the only person to teach this course students do not have a choice and have to sit through his mandatory lectures despite the fact that the same amount of learning and instruction could be gained if a student merely read the book. His laboratories were the worst part of the class, he would regularly come in 10-15 minutes late and provide a procedure which could not be followed unless someone had extensive experience in signal analysis or have used LabView extensively. As this was my first time ever using LabView it was nearly impossible for me to complete the lab by myself and had to receive help from other students. Additionally, there were times when the lab was cancelled because a large number of the students could not complete the lab due to the labs being very vague. :: No. :: the strain gage lab was a bigger disaster than the Iraq war. :: Thanks for the good semester. In the future make sure the pockets of rude people get broken up so your lectures can be heard. :: The class size was too large with too few TA's for effective teaching and help for students. :: No, because students opinions do not matter with the engineering department."
1698,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The Instructor was very effective overall. :: He good. :: Overall, Dr. Jackson is effective. :: He is a good instructor and enjoy his lectures. :: Very good. :: good. :: It makes everyone to work in real life so that's makes some of classes we took in ME real and visible. :: The professor was effective in his labs. :: Dr. Jackson is a great teacher. He provided great instruction for the experiments in class. He graded fairly and was very helpful inside and outside the class. :: Very effective labs were clearly laid out. :: Very effective, he applied his experience in the field to instruction in the class."
1699,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he is. :: The labs were all graded like he said. He did have a stipulation in his syllabus that if you were not able to answer questions about the report you submitted, you would receive a zero. While this is rather harsh, he did not live up to this, even though there were a plethora of students that would have deserved this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
1700,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Given the nature of the course this question is non applicable. Specific days were scheduled to introduce various experiments, but most class periods served as an assured chance for groups to meet to complete experiments. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes he never been late even once. :: He utilized class time well. :: class started on time. :: Yes. This being a lab course, we only had to meet for the intro to each lab. He would start on time, show us everything we needed and answered any questions. :: Yes. :: yes"
1701,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor would ask about any odd results in a lab. :: yes. :: The lab we were working in is way too small it was hard to see what Dr. Jackson was even working with due to all of the students including myself being in the lab. :: Yeah he would answer questions unrelated to the class if you asked. :: yes. :: perfect. :: yes, give us a lot of example he really wanted everybody to learn not just even pass the class. :: He wanted to make sure you gained something from the labs, and that the conclusions that you came to were logical and accurate. :: available for questions outside of class time. :: He would make sure we understood the material. He would have group meetings to discuss data to make sure we knew what we were learning. :: Had students re-do portions of labs in which the recorded data didn't make sense. Gave them a chance to learn from their mistakes and know what to look for in the future. :: He was available outside of class for questions, and was present while the students conducted the experiments."
1702,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In class communication was very effective. Out of class communication was effective, but occasionally unavailable. :: no. :: Extremely well. Once I emailed him a question and he very emailed me back with a very detailed response that helped me with the lab. :: well he responded both to email and in his office hours. :: yes. :: strong. :: even though we don't have to attend the class he will be there for anyone who wants a help. for out the class you can email him or go to his office hours. :: Very well. :: Okay. He often times forgot what he said in office hours. :: Great. Dr. Jackson was available outside of class, whether in his office or online. He would answer in class questions as well. :: Very effectively. :: Very effectively, and he was always responsive to emails."
1703,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The labs were for the most part not always known for clarity. :: yes. :: yes. :: yup it does. :: The labs were more or less structured well. :: about as good as one can expect. :: Yes. Each experiment had a well written manual so that we could follow along. What was needed for each report was clearly described, and any additional information we needed was always provided. :: Yes. :: yes"
1704,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The course did not have scheduled office hours, I did not schedule an appointment this semester, and online communication was overall very reliable. :: no. :: Yes very much so. :: yes. :: yes, very available. :: yes. :: yes he did. :: The professor communicated with the class well and was available for consultation. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was in the lab or in his office whenever he was needed. He promptly replied to emails and answered any questions. :: Yes. :: yes"
1705,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The removal of assigned groups at the end of the semester could have been handled better. This semester, nearly all groups formed for the first such experiment made plans to be grouped during the last such experiment. An individual with poor group members is thus likely to have those same group members during both experiments, a poor position to be in. :: No. :: My favorite lab I've taken at WSU. :: no. :: nup. :: At the beginning of the semester, the professor stated that there would be assigned groups for the labs. What this turned into was him putting students that he deemed as bright with students that he knew struggled some (since he had had most of the students in previous courses). This had good intentions, but what it meant for the bright students in most cases would be for them to do the entire paper. As being a so called bright student, I would read the parts of the report that some other students contributed and it was often wrong, confusing, and/or written in poor English. I was then left to the choice of interpreting their work and trying to fix it, or just to redo the section all together, with the latter being the faster option. This turned into me just doing the entire paper. Granted, after much griping from students, he did change it to where the groups were chosen by the students. :: Wish the projects were graded more promptly. It was difficult to know if the work I was doing was acceptable. Lab manual does not do a good job of explaining what is required for the report (outdated requirements). :: Dr. Jackson is great. I appreciate the things he taught in this class, the helpfulness he provided and just being an overall nice guy to have as a professor. :: No"
1706,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson made this class much more difficult than it had to be.  He is a very nice gentleman, but generally speaking this class would be better if you got a grad student to make videos of the test procedures that we could watch.  Going to class to watch the procedure was usually a waste of time, except for the fact that the labs were poorly written.  Overall we got very little feedback in the class and our grades were much lower than I believe they should be. :: gd. :: very. :: very effective"
1707,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- The labs need to be rewritten in such a way that the students know what information is expected from the lab.  Also, we got very little feedback on the reports.  I know that it is just him and one other TA doing the grading, but there is a serious problem when December 1st rolls around and we only know 16 % of our grade and have written five out of six papers with no feedback whatsoever. :: yes. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1708,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Again, most of the class periods were a waste of time.  Also, there really should be a lab scheduler set up so that students can effectively get their work done in a timely manner.  This is how it works at a professional job, so why not allow students to experience scheduling equipment for blocks of time?. :: yes. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1709,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He is a genuinely nice guy and he tries to answer questions effectively. :: gd. :: by answering questions. :: yes
1710,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He often did not respond to emails, and overall communication outside of the classroom was difficult.  In the classroom he was fine. :: gd. :: very. :: yes"
1711,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I'm going to replace lectures with lab procedures and say no.  The labs are not very well written and they often don't match the procedure shown to us by Dr. Jackson.  I ended up just taking notes on what he showed us and ignoring the procedures most of the time. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes
1712,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He often did not respond to emails, and overall communication outside of the classroom was difficult. :: gd. :: yes. :: yes"
1713,Allen Jackson,2017 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Creating groups randomly was a terrible experience.  There are so many people who did not pull their weight in the project.  I realize that this happens in the workplace, but barring union involvement, there are typically repercussions to not doing work on a team project, i.e. getting fired.  There were no repercussions in this class regardless of the individual's work ethic.  Overall a terrible class with very little utility. :: gd. :: no. :: no additional comments. Just would like some of the assignments to be graded a little quicker, but overall was a good experience."
1714,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- She was very kind and always smiling, however, some of the concepts were a little abstract. :: Sometimes she is vague in the lecture and then expects depth of understanding on the tests. It is hard to figure out what is important to understand for this class. :: Effective, discussed relevant information for both the class and real world applications. :: Poor. :: I will rate 6 out of 10. :: She is very good at teaching the concepts using practical examples and goes into insights of subject as well. :: Very effective."
1715,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I think so, there wasn't really a notification on what your grade was in the class unless you asked her in office hours. :: I feel like the topics in the course syllabus were followed, but that objectives were not clearly established.   It seemed like we had to guess what to study. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1716,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. And the lectures were interesting and enjoyable, but only touched the surface of what we needed to understand. :: Yes. :: Some times late. 5-10 minutes late. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1717,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes. :: She gave us practice problems that clearly helped us learn, but they didn't seem to be connected to the tests. :: Always set aside a little time right before class to discuss any confusions as well as making sure all questions were answered to satisfaction. :: Not applicable. :: 7/10. :: The topics are more in practical applications which were taught in creative way by the professor. :: Yes."
1718,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: I really liked that she helped us to see how equations are developed and kept relating them to simple situations. I think she had coded messages in the lectures about what to study instead of being direct. :: Very effective.  Emails were sent to confirm any change discussed in class. :: Very poor. :: Good. :: Yes the communication is good. :: Alaways available to answer questions by email or during office hours.
1719,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- sometimes, I did learn a lot but it was difficult to follow. :: The course content seemed well organized, however the lectures seemed to touch the surface, while the tests expected depth. :: Yes. :: No. She kept going back and forth. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yeals."
1720,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Was not available at all. We could never get hold of her. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
1721,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Nope. :: No. :: Very disappointed that I took the course. :: No."
1722,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Clear instructor. Organized lectures were very effective (either aligned with book or slides online). Examples in class helpful to highlight important concepts and build intuition. Recommendation of practice problems from end of chapters made clear what was expected for exams. :: She was very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in the students learning. :: she was really thorough with subject tried to help in every aspect of our studies. tried to clear doubts everyway possible and even tried to teach some basics where i felt left behind. :: She usually maximize the time allocated for the class, trying to cover a lot. :: She is so efficient in teaching. Her way of conveying the subject in the class is good for all the levels of students to understand."
1723,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: She was very clear about the requirements and metrics for grading. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Her evaluation procedure was so fair as every student in the class gets his grade based on their capability.
1724,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Class was never stared late that i can recall. :: yes and always give her best. :: Yes. :: She is so punctual. She comes to class exactly on time and effectively uses the full class period.
1725,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Very receptive to in class questions. :: She quickly addressed questions in person or through email. :: she tried to help me everywhere where i got stuck. :: By referring me to read some other textbook and solving more questions that I wasn't indepthly taught during my undergraduate program. :: On the very first day of class, after looking at the syllabus I was so scared because those concepts are so advanced and in depth. Then she divided the whole syllabus into terms, so whole class felt like the subject was easy to learn. Then she started asking us questions from our basic courses and this made the class even more interesting."
1726,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: At the start of every class she went over announcements and questions. :: she was very helpful. :: Very Okay. :: She is so friendly to make conversation both in and out of classroom. In the classroom she used to give time for questions and after that she is always ready to clear doubts through email or during her office hours
1727,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: The course was fairly organized. :: yes. :: To a very good extent, Yes. :: She is pretty good in organizing the course content."
1728,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I never contacted the professor outside of class. :: She was very quick to respond to emails. :: yes everytime. :: She didn't really meet up with my needs about clarifications I needed and kept on referring me to go back and read the textbook instead of helping me with understanding the problem brought to her during the office hours. :: She always responded very quickly for our queries through any medium like during office hours or email."
1729,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2017 Fall,ME 7760,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great class!. :: she is one of the calm and very understanding teacher i have met in my life. thanks. :: She should pay more attention to helping students with clarifications during her office hours and not give the student an impression to feel scared of coming for her office hours because she will always refer the student back to the textbook, that way it looks as if the student didn't read it the first time before coming to her office for help. :: She is an awesome instructor and I really learnt a lot from this class"
1730,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Did a good job conveying information on Machining principles. :: Instructor was not effective at all. Lectures were terribly put together and very hard to understand. :: hes good prof. :: Terrible- his idea of teaching is bringing up a a slide, picking one word out (i.e. feed rate), verbalizing that one word and moving on to the next slide. When he does an example he will slide through it as fast as possible and say "" da da da da da"" as he scrolls through the steps. doesnt explain any steps or any reasoning behind why he did the steps. Class is pointless. Tests are only difficult because we  all have no clue what we are doing and cant learn anything. Book is also useless. :: Useless. :: Okay. :: largely ineffective in teaching the materials that are presented. :: Great guy, not the best professor. :: worse than awful. :: Dr. Lieh would often get distracted and get off topic. He cared for his students, but class time was not always well spent. :: Not effective. :: Effective. :: Not Effective. :: 5/10. :: Excellent. :: ok. :: very good professor. :: There was to much material covered to be of any real world use. He did the best he could to explain different topics but without any real experience with the equipment sometime the variables used in calculations were unclear as to why they were that value. The book wasn't very effective at clearing up issues either."
1731,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, was willing to go over a problem we were stuck in and how to do do well in project. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus some what, but would not post grades which is unacceptable for the cost of class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Somewhat yes. :: Hard to say considering the syllabus was incredibly vague. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes the syllabus was followed."
1732,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Professor routinely ended class 30 minutes early. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes started and ended on time.
1733,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Did a lot in covering mechanical vibrations in machining and the economics of machining principles. :: He did not. :: yes. :: no. :: No. :: good. :: hard to tell, mainly wanted to instruct about his experiences and why we should do school the way he did. :: Asking interesting questions in class. :: he didnt. :: Not really, lab was much more interesting. :: He didn't. :: the way of teaching. :: somewhat made the class interactive and provided real world applications. :: Dr. Lieh wanted to teach us everything he knew about the topic. If we had question, he would answer it with applicable knowledge and experience. :: no. :: good at leaching by having in class problems. :: Gave in class assignments so that we would come to class to get the points."
1734,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did well in communicating with students about questions we had given the textbook we used was not the best. :: Instructor has terrible communication skills. :: yes. :: terrible, didnt know any of my grades. cant use pilot like every other old teacher. :: No. :: good. :: not at all. :: Pretty well. :: not effective at all, due dates were just randomly announced and changed frequently, very chaotic environment when it came to organization. :: fairly well. :: Not a good communicator. He is very unclear and scattered about everything. Expectations were not always clear. :: Email. :: communication was pretty poor. :: Out of classroom: N/A In classroom: 7/10. :: not. :: good. :: There were allot of rude international students that would talk over him constantly that was frustrating sometimes."
1735,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, the lectures were actually better than the book in terms of organization. :: No, the course was shotgun style and you never knew what was going to come up next. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: moderate. :: Organized but not effective. :: Yes well organized but a very ineffective teaching strategy was used. :: No, he would get off topic a lot. :: No. :: Somewhat yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Organized in power points and then posted them to pilot."
1736,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: yes. :: not really, took days to respond to email. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he did. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes I missed a day and he meet me to give them to me."
1737,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4870,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- For the future, a better machining textbook would help since it seems the machining textbook we used had much errors and was horribly disorganized. :: Dr. Lieh is a terrible professor and should not be teaching any course at WSU. I wish I could be refunded for this course because I have learned nothing and have had my time wasted. :: Retire. :: No. :: class time is really boring. Shorter note and more small practice so student learn bit by bit. After that they can do a full problem. :: This class was not worth paying for, if it wasn't for the lab portion this would have been a complete waste of time. The in class portion taught me absolutely nothing. :: no. :: No. :: no thank you. :: no. :: Thanks for the good semester. Drop the grinding chapter since we don't use one in the lab and the section on shapers."
1738,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. Very unorganized. I had no idea when assignments were due or what assignments to do as their due dates seemed arbitrary. :: Not good. :: He is by far the most useless professor I have ever had. Unprepared is too good of a word for him. It seems as if this is the first time he has taught the course, yet when looking on wings express I found he has taught the course SEVERAL times. I cannot even begin to find the words to express his mediocrity. :: Ineffective. :: Not very effective. :: awful I often left more confused after class and he is unorganized and this harm the students. :: Dr. Lieh's capstone class was much more difficult than the classroom section of senior design should be. We spent the first half of the semester completing assignments and going over topics that did not relate at all to the senior design projects, and the second half rushing to finish our proposals. We never were given a specific set of requirements for our assignments. Instead, he would act nonchalant about the assignments and then grade them very harshly. Most of the time in the classroom seemed wasted, as it would have been more beneficial to just get that period to work on our own projects. :: This is the most ineffective instructor I've had in my 121 credit hours of higher education. Why does he teach here?. :: the instructor had some issues applying the guidelines for the class at first and didn't really post things on pilot on a regular basis. :: Moderately effective, I feel the instructional pace could have been quicker, which would have left more time for working on projects and assignments. :: reasonably effective. :: He's not. No one ever knew what was due, when it was due, and what was going on. I still don't know what I was supposed to get out of that class.  He didn't have a reliable syllabus. The only reason we knew to turn something in was by word of mouth.  His grading.. it's laughable. I'm 93% sure he just randomly chooses a number - much like I just did with the 93%. He didn't inform us of ANYTHING related to our senior design project. We didn't even know we were supposed to find a project by emailing professors until the second class. By that time, all the good projects were gone. :: OK, COULD BE BETTER"
1739,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Course seemed unnecessary. Lab work on the actual projects was more important than lecture time. :: Kind of. :: He constantly changed due dates, often completely forgetting what his syllabus said. Before the Thanksgiving break, he changed a due date to the following Monday after break. He made this change two days after our assignment was due, after the vast majority of the class had already submitted their assignments. :: No clue because grades were not uploaded to pilot so i have no clue what my current grade is. We received graded papers back but he would change things or give extra credit so in the end you wouldn't know what your grade was. :: There were no concrete expectations outlined in the syllabus. :: no he would constantly make up assignments and change due dates and course work. :: He would assign things, but he would give us no outline or rubric and then would grade them very harshly because we didn't do it the way he wanted even though we were never shown how it was supposed to be done. For our proposals, he would just say to first turn in a baby proposal and then at the end of the semester turn in an adult proposal. We did that to the best of our ability given the lack of instruction on what was expected, and our grade suffered mightily because of it. :: Absolutely not. His expectations were very unclear. I only ever knew what was due because I heard about it from other students. He very rarely posted assignments on pilot, or wrote them on the board at least. But then when we turned in what we thought he wanted, we'd get low grades because it was missing things we didn't know we needed. I have a 4.0 GPA, so I know how to pay attention, follow instructions, and complete assignments if I have guidelines. How am I supposed to complete assignments that I don't know exist or I don't know the guidelines? I once emailed him back and forth 5 times asking for guidelines for a paper, and only after harassing him for an entire weekend did he post something. This is a class that should be dedicated to our final project, but it was impossible to keep Dr. Lieh pleased. :: yes. :: Not really. Assignments were graded on criteria that were either vaguely alluded to, or not even communication to the students. Grading was inconsistent. He did however give us opportunities to correct assignments. I understand that letting students fail then teaching them through correction is a method sometimes used, I find it to not be conducive to learning and a waste of time. I didn't learn anything by not being able to practice concepts and procedures, then wasting time by doing the assignment twice. :: somewhat. :: YES"
1740,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: He would routinely go on tangents, talking about the American Dream, speaking about how hard work and determination would help you sell yourself to the real world. What this had to do with Gantt Charts and risk management, I have no idea. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no he showed up late rather often. :: Yes. :: Yes, but one time he fell asleep. I have a picture to prove it. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: YES"
1741,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Lieh was helpful in passing along beneficial information to assist in developing future projects. :: He brought in lots of guest speakers. :: If it's possible to have lost brain cells and intelligence from having sat in his class, then I'm sure it's happened to me. :: He didn't, he would rather talk about himself and his accomplishments. :: he did not show any interest in students learning. :: No. :: He demonstrated no interest. If he were interested, he would've been more clear about assignments and easy to work with when asking questions. :: he talked about the multiple projects that engineers work on and how beneficial those projects will be when completed. :: by allowing us to correct assignments. :: yes. :: NOT AT ALL. HE IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THE TOPICS DID NOT INCREASE MY INTEREST IN BECOMING AN ENGINEER."
1742,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Did not clearly indicate expectations for class, nor assignment due dates. :: Poorly. :: Abysmal. He refused to use pilot, stating ""it never worked for him"". And when he did use pilot, he only used to news section to make posts. This meant that no notification went out to alert students to when he made an assignment. The only way to have knowledge of his posts is to have been looking at pilot at the right time. Then when class starts and we had no idea that he wanted us to do something, he would get angry and rant about how pilot is trash and how he never wants to use it. Any suggestions given to him on alternatives for how he could communicate differently were shot down in flames. :: Awful, I never knew what was going on and honestly I don't think he did either. :: Poorly. :: awful, when I went to his office hours to ask a question he responded with ""come to class and youll find out"" even though I had not missed a class previous to this and met him during his office hours. :: He would respond but wouldn't answer the question you had. :: Terrible communication. Was hard to get an email response out of him, and didn't make assignment due dates or expectations clear in class. His accent is difficult to understand, but if he could at least write assignments on the board that would help, or utilize pilot. A lot of times he'd dismiss class, and then while everyone was packing up and leaving, he'd start talking about assignments or writing things on the board. At that point, no one can hear or they're leaving. :: unknown. :: not well, I understood probably 2/3 of what he said because of the language difference. :: the instructor communicated somewhat effecitvely. :: HA!. :: NOT GOOD. BAD USE OF PILOT AND EMAIL, IN MY OPINION."
1743,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. Class seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. Lab time for each group would have been more effective. :: Not at all. :: As I am sure you can infer from previous statements made, organization is not Lieh's forte. Tangents, asides, and branching off are the only way that he knows how to communicate. It was far too often that he would be speaking and I would have to look at someone and ask ""how is this relevant to anything"" only to be met with ""I have no idea"". :: No, completely random, in the end he just filled class time up with guest speakers that I did not find useful for class time. The speakers were good and I learned new things from them but I could have done that on my own time and he could have used class time to maybe teach us something that we could use for senior design. :: No. :: No. :: No. :: Absolutely not organized. The course is supposed to be dedicated to completing our senior design project, but the course content did nothing to help with the design, plan, construction, or anything to do with the project. And often times he'd end up on a tangent about unrelated things. :: it could have been organized in a better way. :: organized, but not helpful. While I did enjoy and learn from the guest speakers he invited, most of the core course material was a repeat of topics and tasks I had learned and been doing my entire time in college. A lot of the course time could have been better spent directly supporting the Capstone project or used as work time. :: somewhat well organized. :: I don't know how to answer this question. What course content?  Nothing was organized, this whole class is a mess and waste of time.  We could have been given time to actually work on our project, but no that would actually benefit us. :: NO. VERY RUSHED."
1744,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Kind of. :: I never want to have to encounter Lieh outside of the times where I am in his class. So I cannot comment on how his office hours were. But that statement itself should be loud enough to show his ineptitude. :: Yes. :: Moderately available. :: No. :: Fair. :: Nope. See any of the other answers above. :: unknown. :: yes. :: yes. :: KIND OF."
1745,Junghsen Lieh,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I recommend immediate termination. :: I think this class needs to be restructured, not worth paying for if this is what I get out of it. :: Dr. Lieh should organize his course more and put more material and standards on Pilot. :: he is the worst professor I have had the misfortune of having class with. He shows no interest in teaching or the students and repeatably singled students out and tried to embarrass them. Due to his actions he hindered our groups senior design project from the start and continues to do so. I believe keeping him as a teacher is harming WSU student's education here. :: no. :: Junghsen Lieh is not an effective instructor and caused much stress without getting anything useful out of it. :: the teacher should post things more on pilot than just saying stuff in class. :: Though the instructor was engaging in class lectures. Overall very nice person. Responded to questions when I needed to ask him. Just wish some of the assignments were more clearly defined as to how they will be graded instead of being more open ended. :: What I learned in this class: Lieh had 7 years of straight A's. :: STRUCTURE OF CLASS COULD BE MUCH BETTER. GUEST SPEAKER ARE NICE THOUGH."
1746,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor covered a lot of material in the short amount of time. However, I struggled to learn with his teaching style. The activities were helpful but sometimes the lectures would be dry and hard to follow. I learned more from the reading and annotating than I usually did from the class periods. :: pretty good. :: Dr. S was a very effective professor. I learned a lot from him this semester. :: extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter, was enthusiastic when teaching, total effectiveness however was just ok, the entire class when it wasnt a quiz day and even having attendance worth part of your grade half the class would be absent. :: I feel like Professor Srinivasan had very little to do with my learning in this class.  Everything was based on outside reading and group work. :: the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well. :: Dr. S is a terrible professor.  He lacks any sort of teaching ability or knowledge of how to relate things to students.  Throughout this semester I have had an extremely hard time following along with the ""lectures"" that he gives on occasion. :: I haven't really learned all that much, the quizzes were not worth a large enough portion of my grade to put effort into studying for, compared to their difficulty. :: very effective. :: Not very effective. Hard to hear him in the large classroom setting even with the microphone turned on. The teaching style he utilized wasn't exactly the most effective. :: Difficult to understand.  rushed through topics, did not take the time to make sure the students understood the material. :: Not very at all. I felt like we were just googling things as a class this semester (literally, we're told to use the internet and outside resources for the group work). Also, I felt like I was just in an online class, and I honestly would've probably learned more if it was. I felt like too much of the course was digitized to be effective, especially in such a conceptual subject like Materials Science. I would've liked more instruction from you as an engineering professional, not just reading these online powerpoint slides. I'm coming to Wright State to interact with engineering professionals, not take an online course. I felt like there just needed to be more of your presence as an instructor, not a moderator for our ""self/group learning."" Please fix this!. :: The instructor himself understood the material very well, but in my opinion was not very effective at teaching the material. The lecture's were hard to follow and dry, and if it was clear that the students didn't understand the material he wouldn't explain it further. :: Very knowledgeable, bland lectures and sometimes tedious. :: He was good. :: He did a good job lecturing. This course was mostly a participation grade. Also, it was at eight in the morning and we mostly sat and listened to him lecturing. It was very difficult for the class to sit still and stay awake while the professor was lecturing as he does not have a loud, attention-grabbing voice. I did not like our online textbook. The annotations we did in our online book were graded very harshly. During the beginning of the course I thought it was impossible to get a 100% on one of them, but I managed a few 100%s. The annotations were worth 20% of our grade so it was a big deal. Also, annotations made learning harder because we were supposed to learn from each other. However, most students had a poor understanding of the concepts so annotations often taught the wrong way of looking at problems. Overall, annotations did not aid in learning, they hindered it. :: He was not the greatest. :: I'd give him a 6/10. :: He tried to teach the class, but it was not interesting enough to pay attention. :: The instructor was overall ineffective. :: Dr. Srinivasan was not very effective. :: This professor seems to care somewhat about student learning however, in class he did not teach very well.  He would give problems for us to do in class without explaining how to do them and then he would not give us the solution to the problems after we finished. This left many of us very confused and we never knew if our solutions were correct or not. :: He rarely lectures and when he does often primarily reads off the slides. There is little direction on the subject, seemingly random facts are given though. :: instructor knows the material well but the structure of the class gave no incentive to actually learn the material. :: I felt like his class was not fair at all. The group mattered more in his class. The final project I have done it all by myself just because my group didnât want to help at all. They got the same grade as me and they didnât do any work. This class wasnât fair at all, I felt like this class should have been an online course. :: fairly effective though a majority of learning was expected to take place outside of class; this method would have been effective in an active learning class if lecture time was spent working examples, but the time was spent on lectures. :: The instructor was rather ineffective, to my experience. :: Good. :: Not very. I feel I have no new knowledge on the subject, however, I will receive an A or B in the class. That is a fail on the instructors end. :: He is a kind man who shows passion for what he teaches. If you make an honest effort in the class, it is easy to succeed. :: Lectures are dry and difficult to follow. Did most of my learning outside of class. :: Not very effective. He always has his mic too low so it is difficult to hear. He provides great practice problems for each chapter but does not provide solutions to them and does not go over the solutions in class. :: Absolutely ineffective. :: Not very effective.  The class does not solidify any information whatsoever. It requires minimal effort and reading the book does not mean the students know the information off hand at any moment.  Lectures are poor as we go through examples and then don't always go through solutions. :: Effectiveness was mediocre. :: Instructor was not very effective in conveying the material. In the beginning of the semester a lot of time was wasted.  I learned the material better from online sources/slides from other schools etc. :: horrible, didn't learn a single thing. :: Moderately effective. :: He is not a very good teacher. :: Overall, I do not feel he was a very effective professor. Almost everything I learned this semester was just from me reading the book. His lectures were very vague, and did not answer many questions students asked of him. I have put a lot of hard work and effort into this class to make sure I get an A in it, but I know many people who slacked off. They did not actually read the book, and did not learn hardly anything; yet they will still be receiving the same letter grade as me due to the set up of his class. Hard work and understanding the content do not equate to success in his class. Overall, this class and the professor was just full of disappointment over and over again. :: Used the whole lecture to go over the course material which helped in understanding the content. :: sufficient. :: Ineffective at lecturing and teaching content. :: Dr. Srinivasan was not as effective an instructor as I would have hoped.  Though he gave a good overview of the subject (which is, to be fair, a big subject to cover) I don't feel like I got as secure a grounding in the subject from his lectures alone.  The homework was a good way to see how the concepts could be applied, but I still felt that, in some areas, he could definitely have been more effective. :: Lets TAs do most of the work for him, lectures briefly and then expects students to know what to do.  Class is set up so it is easy to get a good grade and learn nothing.  Almost never responds to emails unless the same email is sent multiple times. :: Decent. :: -. :: Not effective at all. His course was centered around groups. Did not allow people to learn. His 'lectures' were terrible and were very difficult to pull any information from. :: very effective. :: He was fine"
1747,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, the professor followed his expectations that he had listed in the syllabus. He graded according to the listed scales and was good at saying if there were any schedule changes. :: yes. :: His syllabus was very clear on all the grading policies and class policies and he enforced them in class when needed. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes and no.  Dr. S used an online program to grade our book annotations.  This online program was very finicky and often the grades would change without our or his doing. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Nothing deviated from the syllabus, unfortunately. :: The material was graded and weighted exactly per the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Kinda. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: There was no official syllabus, but rather a series of emails that were sent before the semester began. :: Yes, all of our work was graded as expected. :: Yes, he accurately followed hos syllabus. :: yes. :: No, in his class the group matters more than the individual grade. I really got screwed in this class when it came to grading. He did follow the syllabus, but he was not fair at all. He made the quizzes really hard. :: yes, grading followed the syllabus as expected. :: There was no course syllabus to derive expectations from. What was provided instead were a series of emails blanket addressed to the students, which theoretically contained the information that would have been contained within a syllabus. In practice, however, critical pieces of information, such as assignment schedules or the overall grading scale, were not included or included in fractured forms that had to be pieced together, and by having the information separated into multiple locations the difficulty of actually locating the information one was looking for became a much more difficult exercise than it should have been. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The first reflection was not graded according to the syllabus, but subsequent assignments were. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but expectations are extremely low and pathetic. :: Yeah. :: Yes. :: for the most part he didn't evaluate us. :: yes. :: He followed the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.  Course was graded based on attendance of class and completing homework.  Actual knowledge was not necessary. :: Yes. :: The course syllabus and evaluations were very clear, and followed exactly by Dr. Srinivasan. :: Yes. :: -. :: Yes. :: yes"
1748,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The professor started class on time and always used the entire class period. :: he was early every time and used the entire period. :: Always started on time and used the whole class period. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Because this was an 8:00am it didn't exactly start at  8:00 all the time because sometimes half the lecture would be late due to a traffic incident or something. That's not your fault, but it should be considered when half of this course grade is based on attendance. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: We usually started a few minutes after 8 am because the professor had to log on to the lecturer computer and pull up his teaching materials. Also, a lot of students came late to class everyday because it was at 8 am. :: No. :: Yes. :: Class typically started soon after the time it was supposed to, and regularly ended on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He always started on time and used the full time. :: Class started on time everyday and never let the class out early. :: yes. :: He stared on time and finished on time. I felt like that was the only good thing that happened in the whole class. :: yes class time was well used. :: Classes actually did start on time, for the most part, and tended to go the full length. Whether that time was used efficiently is a different question. :: Yes. :: Pretty much. :: Yes. :: always on time and used full period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. :: Wasted a lot of the time through out the period in the beginning of the semester but usually started and ended on time. :: yeah. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: like clockwork. :: yes. :: He usually took longer getting set up, and so lectures often started a few minutes late. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: -. :: Yes. :: yes"
1749,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor showed interest by noticing if table members did not show up and knowing me by name. He also would walk around the tables in the scale up classroom to answer questions, which was helpful. :: He would meet during his office hours or after class and find time for you. :: Always. He would also bring in examples of materials in class so we can physically see what was being talked about in class. :: with in class work he would be engaging and walk about the class interacting with students. :: He always provide power points and notes that help us. :: Not at all!!! Dr. S was very degrading and rude.  When asking him a question his response was usually extremely rude or some sort of snide comment. :: I'm not sure. I would lean towards no. :: He was always there for questions. :: He was not very interactive with students.  did not help when asked to explain a problem set in class. :: I'm actually not really sure. I didn't interact with you really at all this semester. Lack of interaction may be an indication in itself.. I mean I guess you showed up to class so I'll give you that. :: While the class was crucial to my major, however, the professor didn't really make the course interesting. :: Homework reflections and releasing confusions reports. :: Yes. :: He had us fill out homework reflections and he posted the solutions to our homeworks so we knew the correct way of solving the problems. :: He did not. :: He really didn't, he just read off of slides. :: There really was no sign of this. :: During the in class examples the instructor would not explain how to solve the answer from the initial problem. :: He asked us to apply what we learned to real-life examples. :: He would answer emails. Otherwise, he did not seem to care too much. If a question was asked he never actually would fully explain the solution to our misconception or problem. :: Didn't seem to care much, atleast he didn't make an effort to make the learning worse than it had to be. :: was sure to answer questions well and was willing to help. :: He didnât at all, he kept talking during his lecture and when u email him, he never responds at all. Thatâs something that I really didnât like at all. I have emailed him like 100 times and I never received one single respond from him. :: occasionally brought examples/models to class and encouraged slightly more participation than just a regular lecture; however, having been in multiple active learning classes this one was a disappointment. When the opportunity was given to work example problems in groups, LAs were not always aware of what to do themselves, and the class would move on once he had any indication that just one person had gotten the correct answer. The class was mostly lecture despite being described and structured as active learning. :: The instructor seemed to have an interest in the material he was teaching, but I could not say that he had a great interest in the students. In my entire time in the class, I do not believe that we have spoken more than five words to each other. We have interacted so little that I do not even remember the instructor's name, as all interactions, including in the classroom itself, were through a Teaching Assistant. :: Updating pilot with materials. :: More than willing to talk about the course content and beyond. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He didn't, he just read off of a microsoft word document and the TA was of almost no use because his English was almost incomprehensible. :: Very little. :: Didn't at all. :: Very little, showed some applications in further course work, fewer in industry.  The instructor was unclear on many points or seemed to be disjointed in presentation of material.  No drive to have the students learn effectively since he showed little interest in teaching despite hearing of high praise of his knowledge on the subject. :: It seemed like he didn't really care about our learning. :: by teaching class?. :: No. I asked him a question in class; he then looked at me, smiled, and walked away. He then proceeded to just do something else. It made me as a student feel very unimportant to him. :: The class was like a normal lecture where we just learned from a powerpoint slide while he explained everything more thoroughly. :: As much as he could with such a preposterously large class. I think the class would be much better if it was a fraction of the size it currently is. :: An end of the year project relating materials to super heros. :: The class was a bigger one, so little time could be spent on individual students.  I feel like, in a smaller class, he might have been more able to focus on his students, but his style was more based for a larger audience. :: He gave examples of real life applications and brought in visuals. :: -. :: Didn't really. :: being interesting"
1750,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor did not always respond to emails out of class. There were a couple times that I did not receive an email response about a question that I had. :: Yes. :: He was always available during his office hours and responded fairly quickly to emails. :: fairly well, expectations were always understandable, interactions through email would make communication slightly difficult. :: He communicated well. :: The instructor is very nice and friendly and like to help us even out side of the class. :: Terribly.  Dr. S would not answer emails this entire semester.  In the classroom he was often not loud enough and talked with a muffled tone into the microphone. :: He sent out emails about important things. :: very effective. :: in class- rushed through topics, didn't take time to make sure students actually understood the materials, the TAs were about as in the dark as the students and weren't much help either out of class- disorganized, changed due dates and emailed students two days AFTER the revised due date had passed. :: Communicated well. Not an issue of miscommunication. :: It was hard to get a response from the professor outside of class. :: by use of email. :: He was effective in and out of the classroom. :: He did a good job of communicating both in class and through email. :: He was not very clear. :: He just read slides. :: I would not know, I did not try to communicate with him in the classroom or outside of the classroom. :: The instructor did not communicate effectively during the lecture. :: He was rather effective with his emails, but was not very effective with Pilot. :: Iâm class, he lectured well but it didnât seem to be what we needed to know in order to solve the in class problems. He lectured over theory but gave no examples on how to do calculations. I often didnât even know what equations we needed to use. :: I don't know about out of the classroom, but in class he told the class what needed to be done and when the dates were, however his explanations of thing are long winded and mean little without much context on new subjects. :: pretty effectively. :: Not good at all. He always talking the whole time during class time and when I email him outside of class, e never responds at all. This is something that I really hated. :: very effective with email communication, not all that effective with engaging students in communication during lectures. :: Communication was poor. Soft-spoken as he was, it was difficult to hear him in the classroom when his microphone was functioning, and impossible to hear him when it ceased to function, which occurred frequently. Being in a scale-up classroom, it was also extremely difficult to hear over the conversations of students which were supposed to happen as part of the course's proper functioning. Communication outside of the classroom was nearly nonexistent, with the only communications received outside of class being the 'dear students' emails that were sent in place of a proper syllabus. :: Well. :: Always clear instructions. :: Very well. :: Hard to understand him, instructions often confusing. Many emails over the same topic. :: He answered emails very well. Assignments and quizzes were well discussed. :: Mediocre. :: Average. :: Terrible. never responds to email, no communication and allows relayed you to the TA and wouldn't field any questions at all. :: Inside: There was a definite disconnect between instructor and class.  The material was simply presented not taught.   Outside: Way too many emails towards the beginning of the semester.  Consider consolidating the ""Dear student"" letters and schedules into one comprehensive syllabus. :: Never bothered. :: poorly. :: Not very well. I emailed him one time this semester and he never responded. :: Gave us information out of class by email to update us on class information. :: as well as he can be expected to in such a ridiculously large class. :: Communication was attempted in the class room. :: He communicated with a number of emails, and was reasonably effective at communication. :: Very well. :: -. :: Decent. :: very effective"
1751,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course and lectures were very organized. The professor was prepared for the class and understood the material well. :: yes, everything was laid out on pilot. :: Yes, he posted all his lecture slides on pilot and we always knew what was going to be talked about in class that day. :: yes. :: Yes, but most of the class was spent figuring things out with our groups instead of lecturing. :: Yes the material is very organized. and the lecture is very organized. :: not at all.  Dr. S did not prepare well for lectures.  The lecture slides were usually out of order.  Dr. S would assign problems and give us minutes to work on a them. :: Yes? and no, I don't really understand how students are supposed to learn anything in this course. :: yes. :: They didn't really seem like it. :: Very rushed.  Would have been a much better class if we had more time to understand everything. :: I'd like to say that this summer I was very excited about this course, but I'd now like to say that I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Almost all of the resources for this class were online. Persuall and the annotation assignments were probably the worst thing to happen to this class. I actually despise ebooks, and I was very saddened to here that it was required for this course. About 3/4 of the way through the semester and failing almost every quiz, I checked out another edition of this textbook from the library, and I have to say that my understanding of the material significantly increased. I learned more with my sessions with the hard copy of the textbook than with my time on Persuall. I feel like this is the case with several students. You really shouldn't force your students to learn with an ebook, because most students don't have much experience with them, and I don't think it's your place to try and force that upon them during my time in this class. Instead of trying to learn Structures and Properties of Materials, I'm now trying to learn how to use an ebook AND Structures and Properties of Materials. You should just require the textbook, not the form it's offered. I often felt handicapped with this because I learn better with hard-copies but I'm literally required to use it for our annotation grades. The annotations were also a waste of my time. To get a good score on them you had to write about a paragraph for each one, which leads to five per annotation which is the equivalent of a small essay per assignment, which is due like twice a week. These would take me on average about 2 hours to complete, and diverted my attention from the textbook readings. I spent way more time trying to get a good grade on the annotations than I did actually reading the textbook. . JUST STOP USING PERSUALL and assign chapter readings so we can actually digest the material. ***I suggest that you get rid of Persuall and the annotation grades and just highlight specific reading assignments. If the sole purpose of Persuall was to to hold students accountable for the reading assignments, just do a small concept quiz at the end of each class over the readings and lecture. This will hold students accountable for the readings and will actually get them to come to class. AND the TAs might actually have something to do/grade (the TAs were practically useless, they just kind of twiddled their thumbs the whole semester and didn't really help). Also, I think you should do more of a traditional active learning environment. I'm suggesting you restructure the course in this way: 1. Stop the requirement of the ebook and banish Perusall. Just require the textbook for reading! 2. Replace Perusall with assigned readings, and test students on these readings at the end each class with a small quiz. 3. At the beginning of class, spend about 10 minutes working out a group problem that is graded by the TAs (so that way we actually interact with the TAs), and then lecture the rest of the time up to the quiz. 4. STOP DOING CLICKER QUIZZES!!! These had so many issues. Just have them be periodic written tests and have the TAs grade them.. 5. Just have regular homework assignments and stop the ""reflection"" idea. No one sincerely does this.. 6. If you decide to make attendance a grade, you need to include a series of drops in the semester for attendance and other assignments. This way you can stop dealing with people's excuses as to why they were ""late."" (Also, it didn't help that this class was a huge 8:00am lecture, so attendance was highly dependent on traffic and other factors) * I spent a significant amount of time thinking about this because of my level of disappointment. I was actually considering getting into MSE before this course, and the functionality of this classroom made me abandon that idea **. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He had everything ready to go even before the start of class. :: Not at all. :: Yes. :: Yes, they followed the syllabus really well, despite the schedule needing to be changed near the end of the semester. :: No. After only 2 weeks the instructor assigned a reading on a chapter that would only be seen in-depth until november. :: Yes. :: His lectures did not match up well with the in class problems. :: The course content and lectures were never on the same page, the out of class homework never focused on what the lectures were about because they were always 2-3 weeks ahead due to how closely packed they were. :: yes. :: It was not organized at all, we kept jumping all over the place. This is somethings that I really hated. We kept moving from the front to the back of the book and backwords, it was really bad. :: yes the course content was logically organized. :: Organization of the class was poor for the medium in which it was used. I feel that the organization of the class was more intended for a regular lecture hall, and then retrofitted at the last minute to attempt to use the scale-up classroom method. Long stretches of lecturing were suddenly interrupted for the students to do a single problem with minimal explanation of the procedures necessary, and then almost immediately whip-lashed back into lecturing. The Teaching Assistants, which are one of the critical components of the scale-up method's proper function, were often not of assistance, and in some situations actually worsened the student's understanding of the situation. Recitations were quite often a complete joke, and did nothing of actual use for the students, something that the students quickly picked up on. Between all things, the class was an excellent example of a dysfunctional classroom. I would suggest, if you decide to try to tool the class more towards a scale-up design, to contact Dr. Randy Mieskoski from the Physics department. His 'See One, Do One, Teach One' setup has had a great amount of success with scale-up classrooms, and perhaps his method might be of assistance in reorganizing this class. :: Reading assignments did not usually line up with in class materials. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, presented from lecture slides. :: Yes. :: Mildly. :: Average. :: yah. :: Not at all.  Although sorted in a logical way, the content within the each lecture topic was disconnected and did not coney to the students.  The information was presented not taught.  Learned more from other courses and online sources than this class. :: Nope, they were all over the place every single day. :: not really. :: For the most part, yes. :: Yes the lectures were well organized. :: yes. :: lectures were organized except for class work days. :: They were, actually. :: I found it more helpful when Dr. Srinivasan lectured over a particular topic rather than only discussing it in a group setting. While problem solving in a group is beneficial, sometimes its a ""blind leading the blind"" situation. It was hard to find out if our answers were correct during lecture. :: Yes. :: -. :: Sort of. :: yes"
1752,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor did not always respond to emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was always available. :: hard to make an appoint with as both schedules were busy. :: yes. :: Yes he is always available during the office hours. :: No. :: No experience with this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes! Very accommodating!!. :: No, when I would email him questions I wouldn't hear back from him for some time. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: I sent him an email and he never answered back. :: He was available. :: Yes. :: I would not know, I did not use these opportunities. :: Yes. :: He seemed cold and uninviting, but was available. :: Yes however when we asked him questions he didnât fully answer them. :: No comment. :: yes. :: He was not available outside of class, I have emailed him alike a 100 times and sinhave never received one single email alt all. :: I did not personally attempt to reach out to the professor through office hours/etc so I cannot comment on this. :: Availability was low, as his office hours were never actually stated to the students. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No, never responded to any of my emails. :: Yes. :: Partially. :: No. :: No, never online responds. :: Yes. :: didn't contact, cant say. :: I never needed to go to office hours. :: Yes, but the TA was very helpful to where I didn't really need him out of class. :: yes. :: na. :: Yes. :: -. :: yes"
1753,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The professor did a good job of covering the required material. At the beginning of the semester he should go into more detail about how to do annotations and explain what parts need read of the book. He should also make sure to take the time to actually answer the problems that we do in class. For some activities we did in class, it would seem like he would have us do them and then never actually go over the answer. Overall, the professor did expose us to a lot of information about materials and was an organized professor. :: Nothing about Dr. S but the TA I was assigned this semester for recitation and for in class was not very helpful. She didn't understand half of what was going on and she definitely played favorites within her recitation group. I feel like my grade has suffered because she would never come to our table to answer questions or help during recitation. There was one table in particular she stuck to and would actually sit with them for most of the semester. :: nope. :: no, Thank you. :: Dr. S was absolutely terrible and I can say with complete confidence that his teaching is not effective.  Throughout the semester Dr, S and his Learning assistants have been extremely rude and degrading to everybody.  this class has taught me nothing at all and i hope to never have to take his class again.  He needs to be fired for being incompetent.  My learning assistant was terrible and was rude.  he routinely called us stupid and would not help out when asked. :: Kimia was the worst LA ever. She confused me even more. Told us wrong information multiple times and spend 30 minutes per recitation looking at her laptop trying to figure out how to solve the problem. Was not prepared and did not have enough knowledge to LA for this course. :: Nope. :: Overall, I'm disappointed. Please read my long comments above and take them into consideration. I've spent a significant amount of time on that because I actually care and was troubled about this course in general. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. Thanks for reading. :: N/a. :: He was good. :: I think the class was fair except for the computer grader for our annotations. When using clickers on quizzes I would have liked to see my answers to all the quiz questions side by side with the correct answers to the quiz questions. That would be more meaningful to me than just a grade. I also did not like having to buy a digital copy of the book. I prefer paper copies so that I can make notes in them of things that I think are important. The online book was cluttered with everyone's mandatory comments. :: No. :: His LA's were highly ineffective. They did not have basic knowledge of the material covered and were difficult to understand when they did have answers. :: His TAâs seemed more confused than the students often times. Also, things were never well explained. It left his students very confused. :: no. :: This class was really bad, he talks all the time in the class and when u have a question, he never responds at all. I felt like this class should be an online course. I didnât like this class at all, he always made me feel that I wanted to sleep. Also his accent made it hard to understand. The group work matters much more than the individual grade. :: the class would be better off restructured as a lecture class, because that's how it was taught but not how it was graded/activities were planned. I did however like the concept of group and individual quizzes, and how the homework was discussed in groups and then reflected on rather than graded for accuracy. The main issue I had with the class was the very high grade weighting on Perusall when the material was going to be lectured on in the next class anyway; there was little motivation to do the reading and hardly anyone did the reading, just did enough annotations to get the grade. That 20% of the grade depended on this seemed ridiculous to me; I believe there should have been much more weight on the quizzes and less on Perusall. :: This class was quite possibly the worst class I have experienced at Wright State. My reasoning for this is listed below. A large portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were annotations of the textbook, which was required to be purchased through a particular third-party site. These annotations were extended response sentences, and were intended to make the students analyze the material to gain insights into what the text was covering. This wasn't a particularly bad idea in theory, but the implementation of the concept left much to be desired. All grading of responses was done by the third party website's automated grading algorithm, with the 'best 5' responses determining the student's grade on the assignment. Those with a knowledge of what software is currently capable of would realize that algorithmic approaches to parsing English sentences is a seriously difficult task, which still has not been adequately solved by dedicated research teams. As such, there were serious holes in the algorithm that were quickly identified and exploited by the students. There were multiple instances in which students would annotate vocabulary words within the section, and respond with a definition pulled directly from an internet search for the word. These responses would receive full marks for the assignment, despite not actually having any analysis of the material done on the part of the student. Additionally, due to the minimum responses required for an assignment, giving actual analytical answers became a time consuming process, while students who exploited the system were finished in under ten minutes, and often with better grades. All of this was visible to the student body, as the annotations were public to those within a student's division of the class, which equated to about one sixth of the students in attendance. Another significant portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were homework assignments. There were five assignments across the semester, with half of each grade being completion, and the other half being a guided reflection sheet designed to encourage self-analysis, and also act as a feedback measure to the faculty. The problems came in that there was no actual accountability required in the process. Assignments were not checked for correctness at any stage along the process, meaning that students did not receive feedback as to whether or not they had properly understood or implemented the concepts. There was often little support in the actual lectures for the calculations required in the assignments, with the lectures focusing almost entirely on theory and disregarding calculations, which left students to fend for themselves in trying to learn how to complete the assignments. There were multiple instances of dishonest behavior when completing assignments, with at least one instance in which a student was taking answers for their homework off of Chegg, (a website designed for copying answers for homework,) directly in front of a Teaching Assistant. No comment was made by the TA, despite looking directly at the screen as the student worked. And with the reflection sheets, which were supposed to act as a feedback measure, that feedback was never visibly acted upon, and I seriously doubt that any of the feedback given within them (including some of the problems listed in these paragraphs!) ever reached the instructor. Across the board, there was not a great deal of respect on either side of the student-instructor division. For a Sophomore level course, seating in the classroom was fully by assignment, and attendance was mandatory at 15% of the final grade, with no allowances for missing days due to situations such as sickness or family emergencies. The instructor did not trust the students to organize themselves to learn efficiently, simultaneously removing the ability of the students to form into effective groups, which is a vital component of the scale-up methodology. Additionally, he had to resort to forcing attendance through grade manipulation in order to make students attend class, instead of making attendance actually worthwhile in learning the material. Whether or not the instructor actually disrespected the students isn't quite as important here as the perceived disrespect by the student body, which they reacted to. Students would attend lecture, and complete their homework for other courses, as they knew that trying to pay attention would not actually teach them. Recitations were far worse than lectures, and one of the most chilling moments was the complete silence as the TA stood by the board, with nearly every student in the recitation section working on other things, including but not limited to: Assignments for other classes; Crosswords; Video Games; Social Media; and Professional Accounts such as LinkedIn. This silence continued for nearly three minutes, in which the students were physically present, but not mentally present.  The students do not have a high opinion of the course. In an informal survey of about 20 students in the course of 110, not a single one had a positive reaction towards the course, and over half of them stated that it was the worst course that they were taking this semester. This was coming from students who were also taking courses such as Physics II, Calculus III, or Differential Equations. Over half of them admitted to doing other coursework during the class, and the vast majority of those surveyed stated that they did hadn't really learned anything. Now, this was only a sample of the class, and most of them shared a recitation course, but the overwhelming response received is concerning, to state mildly. As for my own personal thoughts, this course has been of little help to me. This course has taught me little more than what I could have learned from buying a textbook and studying independently for a semester. Doing that would actually still have been more beneficial, as afterwards I would still have a textbook available for reference, something that I will not have after this class due to the required purchase of an e-book from a limited-time third party site. I have learned more of the material for this class from its sister class, Metallography, than I actually have from the lecturing for this class. Will I pass this class? Quite likely so, and that is what concerns me. If I can pass this course not actually knowing the material I am supposed to learn, then other students in the class are going to advance with a similar or lower level of knowledge, knowledge we are supposed to know when we continue on to other classes such as Thermodynamics. Even if I do not fail this course, I feel that this course has failed to provide me with the knowledge I have paid time and money to learn, and that is what upsets me the most. This is not meant as an attack against the Instructor or the Teaching Assistants. I feel that outside of the classroom, you are likely all decent people. What I have attempted to convey with my words above is the state of the classroom as it appears from the student's perspective, in the hopes that what I have seen can help to fix the multitude of problems that still exist. I hope that it is of some use, and that changes will actually be made, as I would not wish this class in its current form upon anyone. :: My TA was incompetent in recitation and never knew the answers to any questions we had. I don't feel the structure of this class allows students to learn the material. I believe there needs to be a restructuring of this course if you want students to learn. :: Dr. S is a good teacher and deserves to stay where he is at. :: This class would benefit from being a classical lecture, the ""Scale Up"" program does not seem to fit well. :: Rework the whole classroom. :: Worst teacher I've ever had, I wouldn't even consider him a professor. :: No. :: the class should not be so large. :: na. :: I didn't enjoy the way the material was taught and the use of annotation homework. It felt like annotations were added simply to add time. :: -. :: Stop groups. :: no"
1754,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He's an amazing instructor. He has profound knowledge in what he's teaching. :: He was effective when he used the boards and wrote notes. While he was explaining things that were covered in the book they  were not very clear and were not understood until the topic was covered several times. :: average. :: Overall, he was very effective teaching this course. :: Class time needs to be something besides answering the questions on perusal, this is not helpful.  The day that the chapter of the book was missing and you had to lecture, I actually understood that material more than any other section in the entire semester.  I personally learn so much better from lectures/powerpoints/worked out problems than by discussing the images in the book.  Also the book has so many grammar and spelling errors that it made it difficult sometimes to understand what the book was trying to explain. Many times the book would reference a homework problem or figure that did not exist.  The annotations did not help in my learning, I found myself working the system to make sure my annotations were equally spaced so that the computer would like my comments. :: Very effective, however I feel there were a few aspects of the class that slowed my understanding of the material, described below. :: GREAT."
1755,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, he did. :: Dates and deadlines were alter quite frequently throughout the semester. Based on the work evaluations were mostly fair. :: yes. :: Yes he evaluated my work based on the expectations in the syllabus. :: The first few quizzes were reasonable with multiple choice questions and minimal short answers. The last quiz was completely different format with no warning on changes. It would have been nice to know of the quiz format changes due to taking the quiz to potentially prepare better.  The homeworks are very difficult especially with no problems worked out in class time. Would have liked to have similar problems to homework worked out in class to understand the homework better. I feel that the homeworks were so hard that I did not really learn anything from it and many times did not even know where to start on the problems even with help from the internet and the book. :: yes. :: GREAT"
1756,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, He's good in Time Management. :: He typically used the entire period. :: yes. :: Yes the class pretty much always started on time and always went the full period or over. :: yes, always used entire period and many times went over, and never understood if we had another class after his. :: yes. :: YES"
1757,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Certain things are obvious to interpret, and one of them is that He want every student to feed on his knowledge. So he would ask questions, interact with students individually and correct our misconception. :: He didn't actively take interest. :: he would help students with their questions until they understood the material. :: He always asked to see if we had any questions. He also looked at the questions in the annotations and answered them in class. :: would come over and help with homework problems when completely lost on where to start the problem, but then would leave us stranded and make us decifer what the book was trying to explain even when the book did not help. :: He made a point to spend more time emphasizing topics that we had trouble with. :: SOME WHAT. THE CLASS STRUCTURE IS HARD TO GET USED TO."
1758,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 9 (Both in and out of classroom). :: He tried to send out emails when he made changes to the course schedule. For our final project it was not clearly defined and more then half of the class thought it was a research paper rather than a powerpoint until a week before it was due. :: good. :: He was very good at communicating both in and out of the classroom. :: took days to respond to emails, but would sometimes (not always)  answer them in class time. :: very effectively. :: YES"
1759,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, it was well organized. :: No he never came into lecture really knowing what he was going to lecture over. :: no he just read out of the book. :: Yes the course content and the lectures were well organized. We always had something that we were going over. :: no. chapters were missing in the book. Annotations were late being posted on perusal so the entire semester kept getting delayed leaving limited days to work on term project. Seemed as if lectured were just based off the questions on perusal and were never really planned about what was going to be talked about during class. :: Independently they were. However, when viewed as a whole, I had trouble connecting the lectures with the text. The reading assignments were pretty densely packed with information, and I feel I didn't get much out of the reading assignments because of that. I feel that had we covered the material in lecture before we did the reading assignments, I would have been able to better learn the text in context, and used it as a tool to elaborate on the finer details of the topic that I had already become familiar with through lecture. With that said, Dr. Srinivasan definitely emphasized improving our understanding of the material, and was flexible in conducting the course to accomplish that. :: I WISH THERE WAS MORE CONTENT WRITTEN ON THE BOARD DURING CLASS. MOST OF THE CLASS IS STRICTLY LISTENING, WITHOUT MUCH CONTENT."
1760,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes off course. :: Never went to talk to him and I never email him for anything. :: yes. :: Yes the instructor was always willing and available to help. :: yes. :: YES"
1761,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Fall,ME 6770,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Yes, he's an amazing professor, we are lucky to have Dr. Srinivasan as our Instructor and as our Adviser. :: The scale up class room is not an effective learning style unless the students can sink numerous hours in to the material a day. This is not possible for most undergrad students because they work and typically take 4 other classes along side this class and a equal or greater in difficulty. If just reading the book was an effective means for the majority of students then there would not need to be a person to teach the course. :: the format of the class with the annotations and leaving students to teach themselves was not effective. It required hours to read and reread the text and going to google before I started to understand. The time dedicated to this class took away from the other classes I was taking. :: There are multiple things I did not enjoy about this class. I hated the flipped classroom aspect where we are just supposed to ask questions in class to get answers. Sometimes it's hard to bring up questions when you don't understand the material enough. Reading the book and doing annotations was also terrible. I understand the point to an extent. It did help me some of the time but honestly I think I could have learned significantly more if Dr. Srinivasan would have actually taught the class. There were a few times where he lectured and I learned more on those days than I did reading the book by far. I also hated Perusall because of the way it graded the annotations. It's also very hard to create 5 annotations for like 8 pages of material and 4 of the pages contain figures and images. It is hard to have them all evenly spread out and if you don't spread them out enough, you get docked points which I do not believe is fair. I believe this class is a very important class for materials students especially since it is very relevant when working with metals. I'm disappointed by not learning more and better understanding the material from this class and I was extremely interested in this class. Another thing I did not enjoy with this class was that the homework was unbelievably difficult. Many times it was hard to find the answers in the book if it had the answers and it did not really help my understanding of the material. I think this is because we never did any example problems and never got a chance to see how to solve these problems. One final thought is that I DID NOT like how the last exam (or quiz as he calls them) we took (not the final) was worth more than all our other exams/quizzes combined. Our first 4 quizzes were worth 10, 20, 20, and 20 points for a total of 70 points. Our last exam was worth 75 points and the entire format of the exam was changed and he did not give us any warning that the exam style would be different. This severely hurt my grade in the class because it was weighted so heavily and I was not properly prepared for the exam. This has been a very frustrating class from the beginning to the end.  Overall, I do not believe the flipped classroom style is the best way to teach this class, annotations need to be done better, homework needs to be better, and he needs to communicate a little better about exams/quizzes if things are going to change and if they are going to be so heavily weighted. :: FORMAT OF CLASS COULD BE CHANGED A LITTLE, BUT IT WAS GOOD LEARNING AT THE SAME TIME."
1762,Philip Steinke,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- did very well. :: He does a good job and is easy to connect with when you have questions. :: Great. :: Kind of effective. :: Philip was an effective teacher.

1781,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Good. :: Lots of questions in class. Homework and tests aimed at promoting learning, not just evaluation. :: He describes everything by his own then bring up pictures and other information to provide any further details. :: he gives interesting assignments. :: A great deal."
1782,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good. :: Always willing to discuss problems. Office hours were kept well. :: He is always general with his students and help us to clear our doubts outside office hours also if necessary. :: excellent. :: Superb
1783,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Extremely well organized. Note sets were a great addition to a text that has some problems. The amount of work that Dr. Menart has done on these notes is impressive. :: Perfectly organized. :: yes. :: Very well organized.
1784,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Always. :: yes. :: A big yes."
1785,James Menart,2017 Fall,ME 7550,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Great course. I learned a lot about the field and Dr. Menart's love for the subject comes through.  This is the sort of treatment that I joined the RCL program to see. As far as areas for possible improvement go, it seemed that the course pacing was a bit uneven, with lots of extra time spent on a couple of chapters, as compared with the syllabus, and a couple of chapters left uncovered. One change to speed up the early material would be reducing the time spent coaching the use of Excel. There are many numerical tools out there and graduate students should be expected to bring a toolbox with them to a 7000-level class.  However, I expect that Dr. Menart is drawing on previous experience here and perhaps the coaching is necessary. One compromise might be some video instruction on Pilot that the students could access outside of class. :: I shall definitely look forward for my future courses with Dr. Menart. :: no. :: Nope, he's the best!"
1786,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was overall fairly effective, though some explanations could afford to be clearer. :: He is a good professor. :: explained information in good detail for both the hw and quiz's to be done in a simple matter. :: He did a good job at making the course content easy to understand, and he also answered questions.  This made the class easy for me. :: It was alright. :: Great professor - Subject could be taught with great efficiency if it was not a split level course. :: Dr. Bae is a good teacher.  I feel like he conveys information very well. :: Ha-Rok Bae is not the most effective professor I've had in my college career. Often the only usable notes I have are the example problems we do in class and even then, they are cryptic. Most of the knowledge I gained in the class came from the text and my own personal research. :: Dr. Bae was very effective in teaching this class. He provided summary notes, that were very helpful, in addition to showing multiple ways to solve a problem. The only drawback was that the material is very repetitive which leads to some tuning out during lecture. I think some more classworks would have been able to prevent that. :: Overall pretty effective. He does this annoying thing where he writes on the board on top of stuff he's already written, and it's very hard to follow. His writing is also not the greatest. If he turned on the lights by the chalkboard it would be easier to see too, but mainly I wish he'd erase the whiteboard. :: Very effective instructor. Broke down the material to be extremely simple and understandable. :: he is very good at teaching the material. he is very experienced and knowledgeable. :: Ha Rok Bae was a very effective instructor. :: Dr. Bae taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: He tries to explain things thoroughly, which is appreciated, and goes over examples.  He starts class without warning and gets upset that we haven't started listening even though no one realizes he's started. He does not offer his extra credit fairly - he only allowed 10 people extra credit which brings everyone else's extra credit average down. (But at least we get a chance at extra credit) He does not teach towards his exams and its hard to be prepared for his exams because the homework isn't similar to the exam and he keeps changing the structure of his exams so you can never get used to it. He has a very strict partial credit scale that does not allow for ANY mistakes. :: Dr. Bae is lazy. :: The instructor seemed to know the material very well. One issue was that he used a lot of MATLAB and WOLFRAMATICA in class to solve some of the problems. This was not terrible because we could use them for the homeworks, but they were not available on the exam. This made it difficult to know how to do some of the exam problems by hand because we learned them on software that we couldn't use for the exams. :: Dr. Bae is very enthusiastic about the course material and about teaching it to others. He strives to make sure everyone understands the underlying basic principles and general procedures before diving into the theory and derivation of the complex topics covered. Dr. Bae's approachability helped me to grasp the concepts and ask him questions after class when I didn't quite understand something in the textbook or homework. :: Not effective in the slightest. Had unreasonable expectations for graduate students compared to undergraduate students. :: i. :: Very Poor. :: The classes were poorly organized. The lectures were spratic and it was next to impossible to follow his notes on the board. In addition he would have 3 sets of notes on the projector and then jump all around the board with hard to read comments. He would show the problems in matlab and mathmatica and then test us on how to do it by hand which we would not know how to do. He would often go over time and freeze the time on the board in an effort to make us think it was still 9:18. Overall very unimpressed with the class structure and lay out. :: Terrible. Learning had to be done via youtube tutorials. Was not available during office hours. Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. :: Very effective with use of plenty of examples and teaching strategies. :: Pretty good, I felt I learned a lot on finding the deflection, stress and reaction forces of structures. :: Dr.Bae is one of the most effective instructors. He is a knowledgeable person and have an excellent teaching skill. :: Finite element analysis is one of the core subject for mechanical designing.  Dr. Bae has taught this course very effectively.  Ease in understanding the subject and demonstrated the subject better. He has given a detailed explanation of each and every other topic and made it more specific by teaching several related examples. :: Overall Dr Bae is good instructor but its hard to get excellent grades in his course, beacuse exams are harder compared to others. :: Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly. :: Effectiveness is normal. not good, not bad. we get only theoretical knowledge which is available in textbook also. :: pros Very Professional in work ethic cons solves few problems, cannot understand matter completely, boring, lack of examples, tough paper and tough grader, lots of homework, information can be improved. :: sometimes it gets difficult to pay attention in class. It gets monotonous and boring, the professor has no trick to gather students attention or keep them involved. :: One of the best professors who has taught me. I had a very good time listening to his valuable lectures."
1787,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes,. :: Yes, generally, but I also think that his homework grading was a little bit harsh.  We often had to use the book to figure out how to complete the problems, and often from poorly worded questions on the book's part.  The book was not very good overall, so it was never any surprise when I didn't get a homework question correct.  Also, the feedback on the homework was usually very vague and unhelpful. :: Yes, Ha-Rok Bae evluated the work we did based on the concepts and principals of FEA. :: Yes he followed his syllabus closely in addition to providing a rubric for the project. He also went over what he looks for in his exams (albeit after the exam). :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He evaluated us based on his very flawed grading scale. The work was relevant to the subject, but did little to prepare us for the exam. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I believe that he evaluated my work based upon the expectations described in the course syllabus. The grading was fair and he offered plenty of opportunities for extra credit (on the exams)  and bonus work (in class). :: Instructor offered very little partial credit on exams. ""All or nothing"" grading style. :: Very unclear on what is expected. Always felt he wanted to hide what was expected so students will do bad. Did not care as much of student learning as he did about his own work. :: He did not give partial credit. Hes grading seemed quite inconsistent. As a grad student you might as well just take 20 points off at the beginning because the graduate problems were either tricks or never covered in class. :: No. Grading was 10, 5, or 0.  Mistakes in part A took off points in parts B-G in a problem worth 50% of the grade. The graduate curve was calculated from undergrad grades that have 30+pts of extra credit. :: Yes, course guidelines were followed correctly and understood at beginning of semester. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae organised the mid terms exams really well. He made sure he covered all the topics during the examination and used to evaluate the written work properly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes, but tough in grading. :: Yes. :: Yes, the evaluation was as expected."
1788,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes used all the class period every meeting time. :: Yes. :: Time was used effectively in the class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he was way to accurate when it came to time. :: Yes, class always started on time, and went right up to and even slightly over time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He started class exactly when the clock struck 8:00 pm. He would normally start writing on the white-boards and the class of 60+ people would begin to quiet down. Dr. Bae used the full class period (8:00pm - 9:20 pm) to teach the material. :: Yes. :: Always starts on time, often times would just start teaching without any notice and very quietly. Many times held us over the end of class and was very unclear on when class ended. :: Started on time and often went over. :: No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was always on time and used full class period and made a very good effectiveness on the subject. :: sharp on the time. :: Yes he is very accurate in time. :: yes, this is good thing in instructor. very punctual. :: Yes, very punctual. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was spot on."
1789,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Involvement of the class in working examples. :: Yes. :: showed ways of solving problems in matlab or mathmattica to help show it can be down by both hand and computer. :: He did a great job at answered everyone's questions. :: Matlab. :: Yes, frequently asked for input and proof of understanding. :: He was very good at taking the time to make sure we knew what was going on and generally understood the material. :: Ha-Rok used real world examples based off of typical entry level positions in the engineering to explain to us how the concepts of FEA would be important in our field. :: He showed us how to generate a matlab outline to speed up the homework process. :: He was always willing to help when I would ask him questions after class or email him. He was even nice enough to look at a MATLAB code I'd done and check it for errors, which is tedious to do. I appreciated that. :: Would provide extra material outside of the class for further study. Would always stop to make sure everyone understood the lecture. :: he made sure i understood what the course talked about and how other courses contributed to it. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae would have us work out examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: No. :: Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well. :: Limited interest in student learning. :: Class itself seemed very interesting, however he never truly explained the content or material  but rather showed a matlab code on how the problem was done. Students were not allowed to use matlab on exams so many classes were spent wasting time on matlab code. :: No. :: No, was not available during posted office hours. :: By relating problems solved in class to how the FEA software directly uses the math in real world. :: Answered questions in class, used Matlab to work out problems and Mathematica for derivations. Made code used in class available for use to experiment with. :: Dr.Bae uses his experience while solving problems he applies the formulas to actual real world problems and teaches the approach to solve them. Which makes everyone to focus on his lecture. :: Dr. Bae has provided labs regularly for having a practical demonstration on this subject and also made us choose our own project and work on it for better understanding of the subject which had made me gain more interest in this subject. :: Yes. :: Shows interest to share knowledge to us. :: just asked the question that, is there any question. ? and nothing else. :: not very much. :: Not at all. :: Dr. Bae was interconnecting practicality with the concepts being taught. In that sense, he gave sufficient examples to correlate the theory concepts with real life."
1790,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication was usually effective, with occasional confusion. :: Yes. :: fair. :: Good. :: Alright. :: communication was open and easy fast responses and flexibly availability. :: Yes, very much so. :: Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hours and would answer questions to the best of his ability in class. :: N/a. :: Very well. :: Very effectively. :: he was very flexible with office hours and email. :: ok. :: Dr. Bae used email and Pilot to communicate with us well. :: The professor would hide away in his office when I try to contact him. :: Good. :: Dr. Bae used Pilot News to assign homework problems. It would have been nice to have an inclass announcement during the day when he posted them. I learned to check Pilot just before class time so that I would not miss a posting. Dr. Bae communicated effectively inside the classroom. Unfortunately, I felt the class room was a bit large. His hand writting on the fourth white-board was sometimes hard to read when I was sitting on the side of the first whiteboard. Despite this challenge, Dr. Bae was always willing and able to tell us what he wrote down if we could not clearly see it from where we were sitting. :: Not helpful during office hours. Often made mistakes during lecture. :: very poorly. I did not do well on the first exam but after going over it i felt i did not receive much partial credit especially for a class that is very partial credit heavy in terms on content. Basically a sign mistake or an error in calculations gets only half credit and any mistake after that will get you no credit. Every problem was double and triple penalized for the same mistake many times.  When i tried to get help a couple times he was in his office, he would shut the lights off and even though I knocked on the door he did not answer. As I walked away, he turned his lights back on and even came out of his office to throw something away. When I walked back to his office because I clearly saw him walk back, his lights shut off again and he didn't answer when I knocked. :: His office hours were after the class 930-1030 at night and it was difficult to find time outside of that for consolation. He was very unclear with his instructions (cribsheet size for example). He also was quite confusing trying to explain the course content. I believe he understood the material well but struggled communicating it with the class in a way they could understand. :: Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. Notes were illegible, both in lecture and online.  Learning was done by looking at another teacher's notes, the book, or outside sources. :: Very well through use of email and pilot. :: Pretty good, homeworks were posted on Pilot, everything else was available through Pilot. :: Dr.Bae is professional and punctual. He always clarifies the doubts of any student in the class,he explains it to everyone. Outside the class he helps in understanding and how to approach certain problem students canât solve. He is a great help. :: Ease in understanding the subject, demonstrated each and every other topic . Clarified doubts even during the office hours and also during additional appointment hours. :: Fairly good. :: In class communication is better as compared to out of class. :: communication is moderate. :: Not very approachable. :: Too technical and a bit difficult to understand. :: Dr. Bae was pretty much effective in communicating the concepts both in and out of the classroom."
1791,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Course content was overall well organized, though technical issues occasionally occurred. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Could probably be a little more refined. :: Content was organized but too in depth for undergrad. A lot of focus on the backgrounds and proofs of why more geared towards the grad level. This caused a lot of needed application time and examples needed to be sacrificed. :: Generally the lectures seemed a bit scattered.  This is mostly due to the fact that Dr. Bae uses pre-written notes on a projector, which makes it hard to copy down and allows him to go back and reference earlier parts while adding new material.  In other words, he jumped around the notes a lot, which made it had to copy into our notebook.  Also, the use of MATLAB in order to solve the problems was typically unhelpful to my understanding.  I would have rather spent the time it took to write the scripts in class actually working through a problem by hand to completion, even if that means that some of the matrix addition had to be skipped due to time constraints.  This material is generally very systematic, which means that if we see the process a few times it should be satisfactory.  But writing a script just made it seem more convoluted. :: The material in the lecture did not line up with the lab at all, which made it seem like we were taking two totally seperate classes. :: Yes. :: Some content would have made more sense in a different order, the best example being the final lecture on software FEA techniques which would have been very helpful prior to completing the term project but was only given after the due date. :: Yes except for the writing on top of other stuff on the board thing. :: Yes. :: yes. :: the content and lectures were well organized. :: Yes. :: Vaguely. He went off of his past notes, which were available online. That was very helpful. Honestly, if he put up his notes and examples THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAM, then I wouldn't have a problem with the class at all. :: No. :: It was a little bit difficult to follow sometimes when we jumped around in chapters but otherwise it was ok. :: Yes. I felt the material was well organized. I was a little confused as to why the chapter organization started out as 1, 2, 16, 17, 18, but it was much clearer by the time I finished the class. I now know that the lecture was organized this way to make the theory in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 much easier to understand. The textbook is organized in such a way that allows instructors to adapt the material to fit their curriculum needs. :: Course content seemed to be all over the place. Was not comprehensive. :: Very unorganized. Often times didn't bring his notes and he would ask a student where class ended previously. :: no. :: No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well. :: Yes, Dr. Bae took his time and made us have a better understanding in every other topic taught. :: Yes. :: Yes it is well organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1792,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I have no information on this topic. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I don't know.  I never had to go to his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hour appointments. :: N/a. :: Yes, although office hours only being offered after class ended (9:30 PM) made utilizing them difficult. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. I would try to ask questions and he said he wouldn't help me. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well. He was also available during office hours or by appointment as needed. :: No, instructor had limited office hours that were at unreasonable times. :: very bad. This was explained earlier in the ""How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?"" I am doing bad in this class due to the lack of partial credit. I do not believe my grades on exams are a fair representation of my understanding of the material.  It is ridiculous to not give partial credit or put the learning of the student before own needs. :: no. :: No, was not available during posted office hours. :: Yes, office hours were directly after class. :: Yes. :: He is mostly available to students. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was available during in office hours and he also use to make time to be available during non office hours. :: Yes. :: He is available at office hours and appointments. :: they are available on line (emails). office hours were difficult to communicate. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
1793,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Usage of pilot could be more effective. The Course syllabus, lab schedule, and the only existing link to the project guidelines were posted in the news feed only.  Homework was posted in this news feed, but this news feed does not display on the pilot homepage, nor does it update the course calendar on pilot with due dates, making sorting out due dates a challenge occasionally. :: The FEA project could have been a little different.  I think maybe we should have been given a part to analysis without the directions and then do the analysis ourselves to get the right answers. It took a long time to figure this out for the project since we were never really taught how to use the software, because the labs were just follow the instructions to get the right answers. :: nope. :: Need more examples hand done like the exams will be. more so than the Mat Lab to save time. Proofs and theory can be read in the book and spending great time explain why it works is less helpful then showing how it works. :: Dr. Bae is one of my favorite teachers at Wright State.  He's very nice and very intelligent.  He really seems to care about teaching students and he does a good job with tough material. :: I would like to see more use of the text in class, that way we have some reference to come back to if we get confused while studying. :: I am sad that he is not teaching vibrations next semester. :: Would have preferred if the notes on Pilot were more complete. I attended every class and took what I thought were adequate notes but techniques taught in class were not always the same as those in the textbook and the inability to go back and look at the material that we went over in class made some sections difficult. A more full set of online notes existed, they were shown in classes, but were not posted to Pilot. The lab syllabus was mentioned repeatedly, but there apparently was no lab syllabus. This was confusing. :: He was funny!. :: no. :: Poor. Ineffective teacher. Please remove him. :: I would recommend Dr. Bae for future classes. :: Offer more partial credit on exams. Too harsh on graduate students compared to undergraduate. :: Another unfortunate situation is due to the shortage of classes if anyone fails this class this semester they cannot retake it until fall of 2018. So if you are supposed to graduate in Spring 2018 your graduation will be delayed 2 semesters for 1 class in which no partial credit or explanation for mistakes or help was given. This is not fair to the student. Many people will be affected due to this. He is also very unclear on the crib sheet and what is expected on exams. Often times I felt like he was trying to hide what he wanted just so students will do bad. :: The lab TA also could not communicate in clear English. A project worth 5% of the final grade was given with numerous grammatical errors. :: The labs were not as effective as I felt they could have been. I felt they were focused more on following directions rather than actually learning how to use the software. Many times I didn't know why I was doing something, I just knew that things would work if I did. I felt a lot more things could have been learned, such as element type selection, were left on the table because we had instructions to follow. This made the final project not very effective because I didn't understand the software. I felt the final project would have been better served to be set up like a lab but without the step by step instructions. I think that was basically how it was set up anyway but I'm not really sure.  I though the examples worked in class should have focuses more on running through the problem from step up to end. I felt like quantity of examples work took precedent over quality of examples worked. Using MAtlab to demonstrate problems didn't really help me because I couldn't have Matlab on the exams. If distributed loads was going to be such a big part of the second exam, I think we should have covered it better than we did. I had a total of page of notes of the subject and half of that was the background on the topic and some stuff we did in Matlab with it. We never covered distributed loads in local coordinate systems not aligned with the global coordinate systems and it wasn't in the book. I felt like that was a topic that was important enough to cover more extensively anyway, regardless of its involvement on the exam. Speaking of the exams, one side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet. I was limited on the exams because I could not fit everything necessary to complete the exam on the crib sheet. I can remember some of the more extensive matrices or equations so I would rely on the crib to do that for me but since I couldn't fit everything on there I was between a rock and a hard place. I don't understand why we had to be so limited. I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final since there is more material to cover. It just seemed ridiculous.  (I forgot to put this on my Mechanical Vibrations review but what were you thinking adding a homework assignment and making it due during finals week. Really? I don't know why you couldn't have made it like this class were the last homework assignment was posted with the answers for our review to help us on the final and not for a grade. Seemed completely unnecessary in my opinion). :: Dr.Bae gives a student friendly question with a very small twist. The only problem some students face during exam is they are unable complete all the answers in time even if they know how to solve the entire problems. :: No. :: For bonus questions in exams, he doesn't give half score even if answer is half correct. :: We get more difficult exam paper as expected. :: The exams question are too different than prof taught in lectures. I saw some questions that never faced in homeworks, classworks and in lectures. We never get any small kind of sample like such questions. exams were really hard and each question include many twists in it. Every question is tricky and something different that never imagined and experienced in practical and theorotical life. :: I'm glad to have a professor like him."
1794,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was average for the ME department. a lot of what you learn is taught through homework and examples so as long as you follow along then it should be fine. :: He is a good professor. :: He did a good job at explaining the course content, and he answered questions.  This made the class easy for me. :: Alright. :: Very effective lectures.  Good balance of theory and examples. :: i. :: Pretty effective. Seemed to get better the further we got into the course. :: Dr. Bae was a very effective instructor.  I was able to understand exactly when he was trying to emphasize some critical concept for the course.  He was able to relate the real engineering applications to the theoretical knowledge that he was teaching us.  It was very beneficial to me since I had completed my undergrad ME degree many years ago and have some experience with the engineering applications outside the classroom.  I think he presented the complex concepts in an effective manner that was easy to understand. :: Good instructer, but its hard to get good scores in his subject. :: Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly. :: normal. :: professional, lack of visual approach"
1795,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae followed the course syllabus very closely which was very helpful to me for planning. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: tough grader. :: Yes. But tests were more difficult and extensive than the material taught.
1796,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Since I am paying for my graduate degree out of pocket, I appreciated his efficient and prompt use of class time.  He was mindful of his timing and was very good at avoiding the spanning of complex material presentation across class periods. :: Yes. :: Yes he is very accurate in time. :: yes, very punctual. :: yes. :: Yes."
1797,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- a lot of times he mistook silence as understanding (not totally his fault) or had difficulty understanding why we may be confused on a topic. :: Yes. :: He did a good job at answering students' questions. :: Lab. :: Yes. :: Answered questions in class. Used animations to visually demonstrate how the formulas were working. :: He supported my learning by making himself available outside normal class periods to answer questions which was appreciated. :: He answer clearly our questions and doubts. :: Shows interest to share knowledge to us. :: no. :: no doesn't seem to care. :: None. The classes were monotonous and boring.
1798,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well enough. :: Yes. :: Good. :: Alright. :: Very well. :: Pretty good. Homeworks were posted on Pilot. :: He communicated promptly and effectively with me whenever I emailed him. :: fairly good. :: In class communication is better as compared to out of class. :: very few. :: not very approachable. :: Not at all. Difficult to understand.
1799,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Could be more refined. :: Very much so. :: Yes. :: The course was well organized except that we did not cover the last section on the course syllabus due to insufficient class time remaining.  It was related to design problems and I was looking forward to it.  This isn't really a negative comment towards Dr. Bae because he had to spend some extra in other sections but it would have been nice to cover.  I will be reading the design related sections on my own time after the course is over. :: Yes. :: Yes it is well organized. :: not so well. :: yes, but strict grader. :: Yes."
1800,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: I don't know.  I never had to go to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was very responsive,  I had no issues communicating with him during office hours and via email. :: Yes. :: He is available at office hours and appointments. :: available on line. :: yes. :: Yes."
1801,Harok Bae,2017 Fall,ME 4210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- in class work is appreciated but some times students need more time to complete problems. :: I think the labs had nothing to do with the course. It was based on chapter 6 which was not covered in class and was considered an grad level section of the class. :: The labs were the most useless things I have ever seen. Did absolutely nothing to enhance my knowledge of the subject. I know you said that the labs can't always line up with what is taught in class (at least I think you said that, it might have been said in FEA I'm not entirely sure) but they weren't even close. I had no idea what was going on in the labs. We wasted time trying to collect data when ultimately we would normally be sent the data to use for the reports. The lab time would have been better used explaining how to analyze the data. Of course, it sounds like you were pretty hands off the labs, and didn't really know what was going on with them. So I don't know if it was the TA that was the problem, or the lab set up or what it was, but they were a complete waste of time in my opinion. I wish we would have worked through more examples start to finish in class instead of rushing through different parts of them. It seemed that quantity was valued over quality at times just to get more examples on the board. I would have appreciated it if you would have slowed down some and fully worked all aspects of the problems out to serve as a road map.  One side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet and I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final (I didn't mention this on my FEA review but this statement applies there as well). There was a lot of material covered in class. I was limited on my performance on the second exam not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because I couldn't fit all the necessary equations on my crib sheet and couldn't remember what it was. The crib sheet serves as a reference so we can focus on how to use the formulas and not on what the formulas are. There was a lot of formulas for the second exam and I can only write so small to try to fit them all on my crib sheet. On the topic of the second exam, I understand that the conceptual things are important, but it seemed kinda overkill to make them 70% of the exam when most of class time is spent on application. The exams should reflect what we are doing in class. I understand that a few questions are alright to make sure that we understand the basis why we do things, but 70% of the exam broken up into 10% chucks which are basically hit or miss didn't seem like the best way to test that. :: I appreciated his professionalism and depth of knowledge on the subject.  I look forward to signing up for other classes that he teaches. :: No. :: We get more difficult exam paper as expected. :: Concepts were not clear, too fast and exams were very tricky and twisting. each question is tricky."

I love that he's not only knowledgeable, but makes you stretch just enough to grow as a students. And he's super corny, which is a plus, I love silly humor. :: Above average professor, thinks we should just learn the material overnight and has high expectations of students. Difficult tests and does't even teach the material just does problems over it. Really needs to change his teaching style. :: The instructors enthusiasm really helps with learning something that otherwise is very dry. :: the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well. :: Pretty good. :: Loved this course because of how fun he made it. :: Good. :: Scott Thomas is a very good professor overall.  He was a little bit odd at times, but not in a bad way. :: Scott Thomas was effective in breaking down more complicated topics and presenting them in a step by step format. :: He is a fantastic teacher and is effective. :: Not particularly effective at explaining how to use Matlab, or how it works. :: Awesome.

He kept the class engaging and fun. He was clear on the topics and made sure all students were treated with respect and fairness. :: -. :: Did very well especially considering how large of a class there was. :: Very effective. :: Poor. :: Very effective, i have no complaints about this man. He kept your attention and took interest in your learning. Made the class challenging, but gave you everything you needed to succeed. :: Scott is freaking awesome. I would be lost in Matlab world without him. Truly. The way he teaches is phenomenal, and I can't wait to take more of his classes. :: Dr Thomas did a great job conveying the content. He was very effective, and gave us time to work on the practice problems and help if needed, but allowed us to try to figure it out instead of just forcing all the content on us. :: great. :: He is good, but I think his exams are too hard."
1811,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Exactly so. :: Yes, always stayed on track. :: His syllabus is followed very tightly. :: Yes. :: Yep. :: Absolutely. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes.

He used the entire period. :: -. :: Never started class late once and used the entire period everytime. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the only time class would start a little bit late was on exam days because all the computers had to be put into offline mode and there was a class in that room before. Totally understandable. :: YES. This guy started class EXACTLY at 5. EVERY TIME. The most punctual I have ever seen ANY instructor. :: Yes Dr Thomas did start on time ""5 O'clock exactly"". That is how routinely we started class, and we went the full time. :: yes. :: yes"
1813,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes!. :: Yes. :: He provided many real world examples with great enthusiasm that aided in learning. :: Yes he motivate me and make love learning. :: Yep. :: Through many examples, homework, and testing. :: He made it clear that he was trying to help people understand what they were doing instead of just memorize a bunch of matlab commands. :: He was very enthusiastic and was into every students growth in learning. :: He sort of did.  He would come and ""help"" if we were having issues with a problem but often times his explanation was poor/nonexistent. :: ""Questions, questions, questions"" - always asked if people needed help. :: very interactive, always walks around to every table to help students and make sure they undersatnd. :: He showed his interest and made class a blast with his humor and outgoing attitude. He always came to class happy and ready to show us the ways of matlab. :: seemed excited everyday. :: yes. :: Very much so. :: He would constantly give real examples of when to use the topics.

Perfect structure. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not particularly. Often times I would be confused about what was being said, and sooner or later would stop caring and just hope that the class would end sooner. Lectures were very disorganized, and an entire section was not taught in class, but was still on the exam. He just said (roughly) ""I don't have time to teach this material in class, so you are responsible for learning it"" two days before the exam that would have that material. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Every lecture was very organized and well thought out. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: They were well organized. :: -. :: Everything was set up before class, there was never ant ""on he fly"" things. :: Yes. :: NO!!!

1817,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Scott Thomas is a great instructor and this is a great class. I wish Physics majors were required to take this class, I only took it as an elective to fill in my schedule to full time senior year. Knowing alot of this stuff earlier would have made many hw assignments over the years easier!. :: Great professor I love that he relates what you are learning to the real world so you have a feel of how what you are learning is important. :: No, Thank you. :: Nope. :: None. Thank you so much for a GREAT semester!. :: No. :: no. :: His policy on homework is ""no later than when the dropbox is due"" and that's it, regardless of whatever excuse you may have. While this isn't uncommon in colleges, it has no place in this class. On a number of occasions I was unable to turn in homework due to some bizarre Matlab error on my computer; it would crash when I would try to publish my code as a .pdf, and because of this I would have nothing to turn into the Dropbox. Thomas would not hear what was wrong with my computer, and refused to acknowledge my work despite knowing full well that I had completed the assignment before the deadline. :: no. :: I would like to thank him for a wonderful semester. :: -. :: Dr. Thomas is an amazing instructor who is extremely passionate about what he does. While he is in some ways a ""hard"" teacher because he follows the syllabus exactly with 0 deviations, at least you always know what to expect. I very much enjoyed him as an instructor and would love to have him for other classes. :: Scott did a great job. Very likeable. :: Great guy, bad at teaching Matlab. Goes on even if the class isn't understanding the topic. :: 4.9 out of 5 stars would definitely take him again. :: Dr Thomas did a great job teaching this course and providing plenty of example problems and practice. He also provided plenty of help for students to succeed. :: no"
1818,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He's very effective ... he should have taught thermodynamics 1 too. :: Very well organized professor.  Can tell that he wants the student to learn always excited to teach in class. :: yes. :: Scott Thomas overall is a very effective teacher. He takes the time to care about his students and really helps you apply the subject to real world context. :: Very effective. :: Very effective. :: Scott is a fantastic instructor.  I have had Dr. Thomas for 2 classes now and have learned so much.  Scott is always on time and makes class fun and enjoyable. :: I think he gives plenty of resources that allow for anyone to succeed in this class. I enjoyed the lectures because he is a funny guy, but is also effective in his teaching. :: very effective. :: I took him for a previous class and i still believe he is one of the best professors here at wright state university. :: He is very understanding and knows the material very well. :: 10/10 Great Professor. :: You will not find a more effect professor at this University, or maybe even the state of Ohio. Dr. Thomas is fantastic. :: Overall, I had a good experience in Statics. I'm doing fairly well in the course (about a low A). I think you do a great job with answering questions in class, but I think you should focus your lectures more on the concepts of statics and I think you should spend some time linking the physics behind statics to the example problems from the lecture. Often times, when I would get to a big end of chapter problem I had issues linking that back to physics concepts. Also, I like your optimism in the classroom. It keeps me focused on an inherently boring topic. However, I did feel distracted by a lot of the joking in lecture. I mean it's fun and all, but let's keep a positive attitude and focus on the subject. I did enjoy this semester though!. :: Dr. Thomas was one of the best professors I have ever had. He was very good at teaching the material and worked hard to ensure all students understood the material. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Thomas is an absolutely fantastic professor! One of the best at Wright State. He is extremely effective. He makes sure all of his students know what is going on and is willing to help them in any way possible. :: Dr. Thomas was really engaging and he made sure every one of his students understood,. :: He was a very good teacher. :: His teaching technique was very beneficial to me since I am a person who learns by example. He answered every question to the best of his ability and took the class seriously, but also made it fun to learn. Great job and keep it up. :: Dr. Thomas was overall a very effective instructor. :: He is a very awesome professor. He told us on the very first day that one of his most important words for the class is ""Fair."" He makes sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. He cares about the students and makes class fun. :: Great teacher, he is probably one of the best engineering professors in this school. He is an amazing professor who genuinely cares. I do believe on one of the exams he expected a little too much i felt there was not a lot of time and the majority of the class did not finish or turn in their exams but think this is not his fault since the class length got cut in half from his previous classes he is still adjusting. I learned a lot and enjoyed his class very much. The course was challenging but was manageable with how well Scott was able to teach the class. :: This professor did a good job at teaching however his lectures were always a bit rushed and at times hard to follow. :: instructor was great! very effective at teaching the material and kept class fun and entertaining. :: He is a great professor when it comes to teaching. I really loved his style of teaching. Loved the class so much. Also when u wanted to talk to him he was always there. A great professor overall. :: An excellent professor. Dr Thomas turns Statics from a boatload of work to a fun boatload of work. :: Provided all the information we needed to succeed and endless resources if we needed more practice. :: He is an extremely effective instructor. He makes class fun and interesting in addition to teaching material well. :: Extremely effective. Every lecture was well organized and structured. He is prepared to answer any question and is willing to do whatever is necessary to help a student with their understanding. :: Very good, used lots of examples. Sometimes the examples ran together and became a little monotonous but I also have a short attention span. :: Scott Thomas is an amazing professor who truly cares for his students. :: Scott Thomas was incredibly effective as a teacher.  A lot of my best teachers were the ones that gave numerous examples, and he is no exception.  He used a lot of examples, encouraged class questions, participation, and even allowed us, when we were confused about a methodology, to talk it out to him and each other in class, and he would help us figure it out.  He also was a fun teacher to have and created a positive learning environment. :: He is a very engaging instructor and made the classroom have a very friendly environment. :: very effective"

The course was outlined in the syllabus and Scott followed it to the letter. :: Yes, everything was stated in the syllabus and the syllabus is presented each day. :: Yes. :: yes, you always knew what to expect in class and on homework and tests. :: yes. exactly. :: Yes. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus daily, never went off course at all. :: Yes. Everything in the syllabus was executed as stated. :: Yes, everything was graded fairly and explained well at the beginning of the semester. :: Yes, syllabus is exactly followed. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas follows the all seeing all knowing syllabus to a T. :: Yes he did. :: Yes he did. :: Yes, the all knowing, all seeing syllabus was perfect this semester, unlike the syllabus from Matlab in the Spring of this year. His expectations were laid out from day 1, and he did not change them at any point. :: Yes. Dr. Thomas evaluated my work based off of the expectations in the course syllabus. :: He did. :: Yes, exactly how he described. Often he was generous with points. :: yes. :: No, I felt like his exams are really hard. I studied super hard of the exams and I kept getting 80. Other than his exams he was super fair. The only issue that I faced is the exams that he made. :: Dr. Thomas lays everything out in the syllabus, and is entirely fair with what he expects. :: yes. :: Absolutely, he even showed us the syllabus at the beginning of each class period. :: Yes, grades are determined exactly the way depicted in his syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, and he stuck to the rule he laid out in the syllabus to be fair. :: yes"

He also used the full class period as well. :: yes. :: Yes almost every class. :: Scott started class on time every day.  Scott used the full class period. :: Yes, 12:20 exactly. We got out early a few times, but nothing major. :: yes. :: Yes he would always have new examples to go through every single class period. :: Almost always used the full time. :: Yes. :: Every day, as soon as the clock struck 12:20. :: Started class everyday at ""12:20 exactly!!"" and lectured to 1:15. Sounds good to me. :: Yes, he started class as he said, at 12:20 exactly!. :: Always exactly on time. Used full class even if we finished early to go over extra examples. :: Dr. Thomas would start class at 1:20 exactly every single class. Then he would use all of the class period to make sure we are getting the most information we can during that block,. :: Yes he would always start class with ""It's 12:20 exactly."". :: Yes he did. :: Yes, every class was started promptly at 12:20 and took up the entire time allotted almost every day. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. Every class he would start off by saying 12:20 exactly. (Except for the two or three times the computer restarted on him so he was a couple minutes late). :: He always started exactly on time and usually used the entire class time. :: yes. :: He always started the class on time and he also finished the class on time. He was never late and he never canceled class as well. He is a really respected man. :: ""12:20 exactly!"" Starts like clockwork, and goes as long as we reasonably can. :: Yes, started exactly at 12:20 and almost always taught for the entirety of class. :: Always started class at exactly 12:20 and took up entire period. :: Yes. ""12:20 exactly"". :: Yes, he started class at exactly 12:20 everyday and tried his best to not let us out until 1:15. :: Yes, he always used the full class period but every once in a while we would get out early. :: Yes. :: Yes, the class always started on time and we would work on examples to the end of the class period. :: yes"
1821,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Best teacher that i have had a wright state. :: yup. :: He takes the time to understand you as a person and not only a number in the class. Scott takes the time to connect the subject to how it will be applied in a real engineering job. He makes the class light hearted and not so serious. :: yes. :: Asking questions to keep students attentive and having problems due at end of class to see if people were catching on. :: Yes, he made asking questions easy and was not judgmental about any ""dumb questions"". :: Yes, he had office hours and answered all questions to his best ability during class. He also provided plenty of resources to help all students. :: Made class fun, made jokes. :: He was very interactive with starting new topics, he would make the lectures as fast and interactive as possible. :: answered all questions equally. :: Very interactive class, cares very much for his students and their understanding in the topics discussed in class. :: He constantly reminded us that if we had additional questions, to come to him during office hours. With that being said, I believe most questions got answered in class. He made it a specific point to make sure everyone in the class was comfortable asking questions which really stood out to me. :: Keeping a positive attitude and making us feel comfortable asking questions. A lot of times in the science and engineering courses, professors can cultivate an esoteric atmosphere, which is harmful to students. That is not evident here! I felt comfortable asking questions. :: Dr. Thomas made the class fun! He peaked students learning by making the class interesting, and also communicated with the students in class. :: Probed is to ask relevant questions and often brought up topics related to the subject that are relevant to our field. :: Dr. Thomas cares about every single one of his students. He will not move on in class unless every single person is understanding what is going on. He also will pause during the process of explaining material and ask the students if anyone has questions or will make up his own questions he thinks will help us understand the material. :: Every 5 minutes or so he would stop to answer questions and he takes time to answer every question asked by students. :: I liked his class. :: He treated every question and concern the same way, no matter how good of a question it may have been, and made sure that everyone was on the same page before he moved on to the next step or problem. :: Dr. Thomas will routinely pause during the lecture and ask if anybody has any questions.  This helps to keep everybody on the same page during the lecture. :: He made sure class was fair. He provided all the homework questions on separate handouts and gave solutions to every question on those handouts. He provided every previous exam he had given and the solutions. :: He would respond to emails and questions quickly and to the best of his ability. :: was very willing to spend extra time on individual students questions or to meet outside of class to answer them. :: He made it super easy and when I had questions he answred them really well for me to understand. Overall he is a great professskr take him if you are taking statics. :: Dr. Thomas takes an interest in ensuring that his students are able to understand the material, as well as ensuring the well-being of his students. :: Providing endless resources to make us responsible for our learning. :: Very open to any and all questions during class. We could meet him during office hours. :: He would always answer my questions very thoroughly and ensure I understood.

Scott is very open and will answer all questions to the best of his ability. :: Very well. :: very effective. :: He was very effective with communicating. whether it be questions or concerns about the class. :: emails contained necessary knowledge. :: Very Well. :: Incredibly well, email response time was usually within the hour. :: Fine. Not an issue. :: Dr. Thomas emailed me back very quickly when I had a question, and offered to help me during office hours when ever I could attend. :: Very well. :: Dr. Thomas is always available though email or stopping by his office hours. :: He answered questions and had very flexible office hours. :: He was a good responder. :: His in class communication was very good, and I did not contact him out of class at all so I can not judge that. However, he did email us after each midterm as soon as he had finished grading the test to let us know the grades were in, which I thought was very helpful. :: The instructor communicated effectively inside and outside the classroom. :: He communicated very well throughout the semester both in and out of class. :: He communicated well but as stated earlier, he seems to always be rushed which sometimes makes it difficult to understand material he teaches. :: very effectively. answered emails promptly and was very helpful. :: Amazing in the class he was super great. The issue that I had is in his office hours, there were lots of people there and also he flies through what u needed help with. I felt like the office hours were useless. :: Communication is often clear, and he is more than willing to clarify any confusions. :: Expectations were always very clear. :: Communicated via email for upcoming tests and reminded us of homework assignments the beginning of every class and reviewed where we were at according to syllabus. :: Extremely well. :: he was very effective. :: Very well. :: Communication was very clear with Mr. Thomas in which he stayed a little after class to listen to questions, and had office hours that were clear. :: yes"

If that makes sense? Like every time we would cover a new ""concept"" it would take two seconds to lecture about it and then we would go do problems. THIS IS OKAY, BUT I feel like it would've been better if you highlighted the concepts more instead of burying ourselves in example problems (that's what the homework is for!. :: Yes, every class he walked into he had a plan for. :: Yes, he knew what he doing each and every day. :: The content and lectures are extremely organized. It feels like Dr. Thomas has every single thing we do planned out in advance, which maximizes our learning. :: Yes. :: Yes he was well organized. :: Yes, he had a clear set of lesson plans that flowed well between each class, and the homework problems were all similar to the problems we did together in class. :: Yes. :: They were very organized. :: He is very organized. He lectures over theory and then gives examples for each chapter. :: yes. :: They were very organized, everything was perfectly planned. Didnât had an issue with that. He made everything interesting to learn. The issue that I had was the exams are worth 90% of the overall grade. :: Each day has a specified topic, the lecture notes he works from are all available online, and everything you could ever want as additional reference material is also available online. He's got a good system going, and he sticks to it. :: Yes, he was always prepared. :: very well organized. :: Yes extremely well organized. :: Yes, followed syllabus perfectly. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the material was very well organized and material from each section flowed into the next chapters material. :: yes"
1824,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Scott Thomas replied in emails in a timely manner. He was always available for office hours. :: yes, he is very eager and willing to help. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he is always willing to help no matter what. :: did not go to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes!. :: Yes, he was probably one of the best professors to communicate with as he was interested in helping the students and wanted them to succeed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he had office hours. :: I cannot answer this because I did not use these times that he offered. :: Yes. His office hours were well documented in the syllabus.  He was also responsive online through his email. :: He was. However I would not be the best person to ask since I never needed assistance. :: Yes, he responded to emails very quickly and had office hours everyday we had class. :: absolutely. :: He was available during his office hours, the issue is that there is lots of people there so he flies through the questions that u ask him. This was the biggest issue that I had. :: Reach out to him, and he's there. Dr. Thomas has got your back. :: Yes. :: very responsive. :: Yes. I would get a response within 24 hours. :: yes. :: yes. :: I cannot judge , as I rarely contacted him outside of class. :: Yes, even though I never needed to use his office hours he made it very clear that he would always be available.. :: yes"
1825,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 2120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I think his exams are too much of the grade..especially if there gonna be as hard as he makes them. I think maybe he should add a course project or something instead of exams being 90% of the grade. :: very well spoken teacher respects any and all questions no matter how dumb of a question. Best teacher hopefully able to take more classes with this professor in the future. :: N/a. :: Second time around taking this class and I really like his teaching style. :: No. :: Scott is a fantastic professor and a great person.  I have thoroughly enjoyed being in his class. :: He was a great instructor for this course. :: professor of the year award goes to him! Every year!. :: Great professor and one of the nicest guys on campus. :: I feel bad for the students who didn't have the opportunity to take Dr. Thomas this semester. I really do. :: Overall, a good experience. If anything, I would say you need to push your students a little more. I know for example that I had a habit of just copying down the homework solutions from the website. I know it's not your job to make us take the initiative, but when all of the students taking this class are about in their second year of classes and taking 18 credit hours of hard math and core courses, this class can become less of a priority, WHICH SHOULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE ME CLASS. I know that's not your fault, but overall your students might get something more if there were more intermediate examinations, like in class quizzes or something to kind of force us to study. At any rate, thanks for teaching this semester!. :: Dr. Thomas was probably one of my favorite professors. He was fair, helpful, affective at teaching the material, and I would recommend/sign up for any other class he taught. :: Dr. Thomas is my favorite professor on Wright State's campus. It warms my heart to know that some professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed. I will be taking classes with Dr. Thomas every time my schedule allows it. :: Dr. Thomas has a good system of teaching and is a wonderful teacher. :: He was a great teacher. :: Thank you for making Statics enjoyable, and I hope that I can take another class of yours before I graduate. -Lucas S. :: He is a great professor. :: We need more professors like this. :: I think professor Thomas truly cares about his students learning and is a passionate professor. :: Dr. Thomas is a great Professor. :: Overall the class is grade, but he need to make the grading much easier. He is killing me when it comes to grading. 90% are coming from the exams. Also he is a reallly hard grader as well. :: It's been a pleasure. I hope that I'll be able to work with you again in the future. :: Scott Thomas is a great professor. :: will look for more classes he teaches in the future. :: He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He will go out of his way to ensure the students who reach out to him have a full understanding of the content. :: If you make the exams worth 20 points but only put two questions on it the chances of the class doing well will be slim. My problem would be that I would get one question right and the other wrong and it would dock me like 10-8 points and suddenly I have a D or F. Its a great class but for people who struggle with physic concepts, its demeaning when you get Ds on most of your exams. Extra credit is amazing but that doesn't reassure you as much. I rather have several little quizzes that are for extra credit but allow the professor to see where we stand in the class. :: Overall, I think he taught his class very well and made the class fun. :: no"
1826,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Scott Thomas is a very effective professor. His lecture is never boring and grading system is very fair. :: Dr. Thomas is the best professor I have had at Wright State University. He lectures really well and does more examples than he does notes. This helps learning which makes him very effective. :: Excellent Proffessor and course, I have taken many classes with this instructor and am never disappointed. :: Prof. Thomas is one of the best professors in WSU. In this course I learned a lot from him, his passionate with his subjects. :: Easily the best professor I've had ever. Very attentive, fair, and caring. Always makes sure we understand what is going on before moving on. Super approachable and nice which makes it very easy to ask questions. Very good a communicating the material to us in a way that we understand. He made the class fun. 10 out of 10. :: Awesome Teacher. Lots of Respect. :: He was very excited about the topics, making the course more interesting for the students. This helped me grasp the concepts more. :: Dr. Thomas does a fantastic job with the material. He goes thoroughly through the theory and gives helpful examples. :: Very effective. Good examples/explanations, HW helped understanding. :: awesome af. :: 10/10. :: Scott Thomas is a very good professor. He goes over problems and conceptual example well and makes sure every student understands the material. Even with having a lot on his plate he makes time to help his students when asked. I would take Scott Thomas again in a heartbeat. :: good. :: Exceptional. I learn a lot in every Scott Thomas class. There is an appropriate amount of theory, examples, and application in lecture. It's (often) fair, and I know what is expected of me after every class, every week. Regardless of whatever grade I get in his class, I can walk away from it knowing that I know so much more than I did going into it, and I cannot say that about all my professors. It's not perfect, but it's close. If I had my way, I would have Dr. Thomas teach all my classes. If he reads this, I encourage him to never change the layout of his classes. :: Good. :: Scott is very effective. Tells you exactly what you need to know in a clear and entertaining way. :: Scott is one of the best professors I have had at this school. He provides any and all materials necessary. He is very fair in grading, and he teaches materials that are understanding. He is very organized and helpful. :: Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor. He taught the material to the point that you didn't need a book. :: Extremely effective instructor, enthusiastic about the subject matter, very clear in his instruction and notes. :: -Explained concepts clearly -Engaged entire class -Related Material to actual interesting applications ( made me want to learn the material more and research stuff outside of class) -Has great energy and passion for the subject (makes you remember why you want to be an engineer) -Gave plenty of examples -Felt like writing out all the notes word for word on the board might have been too much. Could have used that time more effectively. :: Mr. Thomas was a very effective instructor. I learned so much from him during this class. Mr. Thomas made the material fun and engaging. He would constantly have students participate and encourage them to ask questions. He was very clear on every thing did, if students had any problem with a topic, he would further explain it and let students know where they could find it in the text. :: Scott was very effective in describing difficult concepts. He was very fair and show many examples to help students better understand the course. :: Very Effective"
1827,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas follows the syllabus and evaluates our work based on the expectations described on the syllabus. :: The Syllabus is Scott Thomas's Bible. :: Yes. :: Yes absolutely. :: Yes. :: Yes. Homework was already assigned at the beginning of the course, dates for all of the exams were given from the start, and the syllabus remained the same through the entire course. :: Absolutely. The all-knowing, all-powerful syllabus is perfect in every way and is followed to the letter. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 10/10. :: Yes, he had every laid out in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and has stuck exactly to it all semester. :: yes. :: The grade is homework and exams with the potential of bonus points simply encourage attendance. I know what is expected of me at all times, and I know exactly what I'm supposed to know at the end of every class. That is not to say I know the material perfectly after every class, but just as important, I know what I don't know and can reinforce and ask questions if I need to. :: Yes. :: Yes, very fair. :: Yes. He graded very fairly and any points I missed, I knew exactly why. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas followed his course syllabus exactly. :: Yes, very fair grader. :: Yes. :: He evaluated work as described in the syllabus to a tee. :: The instructor evaluated my work fair and reasonable amount of time. Scott did a great job in following the syllabus he gave us. :: Yes"
1828,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes, he starts and ends class on time. :: Never Early Never Late. :: Yes. :: Yes ""It's 10:10 exactly"". :: Yes. :: Always started class on time! Right on the button. :: 10:10 every day. :: Yes. :: yes yes yes. :: 10/10. :: He starts exactly when our class is scheduled and he takes the entire time always. :: yes. :: The class starts, as Scott says as he stares at an atomic clock, at ""10:10 exactly"". It always did. It ended exactly 55 minutes later. The class, in the best ways possible, was predictable. There was routine.  Keep that routine. :: Yes. :: Always ""10:10 exactly"". :: Yes. He would start class exactly at the time it was to be started, and went the full class period. If he wanted to end early, he would consult us first to be sure it is okay. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas started and ended the class period exactly on time. :: Yes. :: Started class at 10:10 exactly! Used entire class. :: Mr. Thomas would always start class exactly at the same class start time. He used all of the class period. :: Scott did start class on time and used the full period. He did a great time using the time available to go over the course material. :: Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10:10 Exactly"
1829,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Thomas seems to know everyone's name in the class and really makes people feel like they belong. He is friendly and approachable and inviting to office hours. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas is one of the few professors that actually cares and wants us to learn the material. :: Always attentive to questions, seriously this guy is the best professor at this university hands down!. :: By solving the difficult problems and describe the hard concepts clearly. :: Really made sure we understood what was going on. Wanted us to ask questions and when we did he made sure we understood before continuing. No question was a stupid question and he always wanted to help. :: Explained concepts well. :: He assigned in class extra credit problems and worked with us to see where we were at in the material. If we were having a hard time grasping it, he took class time to go over it again. :: By making the class lectures interesting and giving real world examples. :: Available by email and during office hours, would answer questions as necessary during class. :: goofy and funny. :: 10/10 Uses real world scenarios to help demonstrate learning. :: He will answer any question along with do some research when he does not know. :: yes. :: He's the most personable professor I've had. He addresses students by name and takes whatever time is necessary to answer a question. If the answer isn't so clear and might take time to answer, Scott is ever-present on email. :: Yes. :: Yes, Scott is always willing to help. :: He would make the material interesting. He also would stop frequently to make sure we understood the concepts. He teaches in a very high spirit so the class is enjoyable. :: Dr. Thomas would pause numerous times through lecture to allow for questions and if a question did arise he would stop lecture and explain the concept for however long he had to until it made sense to the student. He also allowed for in-class work that allowed for the students to work through a problem together and ask questions along the way make sure the students are understanding the material. :: Encouraged students to come to office hours, gladly answered any questions during class and after class. :: He encouraged questions and gave real life examples of in-class topics at least weekly. He would even explain not in-class material (topic related but not taught in class) if asked. :: Scott was very interested in my learning, he helped describe materials that I didn't comprehend the first time. :: Always"
1830,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively in both. Course expectations were clear from day 1 and consistent throughout the semester. Dr. Thomas returns e-mails promptly and is available in office hours. :: Very well. I had a medical situation on he was willing to help me in anyway possible in and out of the classroom. :: always available to help, excellent office hour times. :: Prof. Scott is available during class time and office hours. :: Extremely well. No complaints. :: Excellent. :: Very effective. Quick response time to emails!. :: Great. :: Very well. Explanations were clear and helpful. :: awesomely. :: 10/10. :: he is very good at communicating in and outside of class. he is very good about responding to emails and will take the time in class to make sure the student understands the topic they asked about. :: yes. :: Better than any professor in the CECS at WSU. That's a fact. Class lectures weren't so upper level that they couldn't be understood. Many professors miss the mark by essentially wasting hours of class time on theory and derivation. As I said, there is an appropriate time spent doing this in Scott's class. I've had him for 55 minute classes (such as this class) and for 80 minute classes. Time is never wasted. :: Very good. :: Great communication. :: He communicated greatly in class, he would answer and questions or concerns. :: Dr. Thomas was very effective in his communication to the class about exam material, homework due dates, and etc. :: Very effectively, outside of the classroom via email. :: Mr. Thomas was very effective at communicating. He was available for office hours and responded to any e-mails within a day. In classroom, he would answer any question to his knowledge and was very clear on presenting topics. :: Scott was very effective both in and out of the classroom. He used his time well in class and was available during office hours and email if I need any additional help. :: Effective"
1831,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course was very well-organized and prepared for. :: Yes, everything was very well organized. :: yes, all of the notes are online. :: Yes. :: Yes very well organized. The syllabus was followed to the day. :: Yes. :: Very organized! Hardly every off topic. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes yes yes. :: 10/10. :: they were organized very well. :: yes. :: Always. He sticks to his schedule and meters out the class to get done with the material in time. The ""all powerful"" syllabus (as he calls it) was accurate every day. :: Yes. :: Very organized. :: Yes. We followed the syllabus to the tee. He would start class on time, and cover the material as written. :: Yes, the lectures were very well organized and easy to follow. :: Yes, never deviated from the syllabus. :: Yes. :: They were very well organized. I believe no topics were discussed in a fashion that did not make sense. All topics that were needed for another topic were addressed beforehand. :: The course content and lectures were very well organized. Scott was on time and finished each chapter that was on the syllabus. :: Very orgainized"
1832,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, he was available basically all the time if we need it. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: for shizzle. :: 10/10. :: The instructor was reasonably available. :: yes. :: He was, though it is hardly necessary. The books he uses are followed well enough that they can referenced. Additionally, every problem is available online with a solution. I will never know why professors are against this approach. People learn this material by seeing it executed. This is one of the biggest learning aids in his classes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never had to contact Scott outside of class, but I know he will meet with students whenever needed, and he has responded promptly to my emails in the past. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas was available during office and if he was unavailable contacting him via email was a good option because he got back with you in a short period of time. :: Always available during walk-in office hours, and responded to emails quickly. :: Didn't need to, he did well enough in class and with the supplemental material on Pilot. :: Mr. Thomas was very reasonably available. :: Scott was available and responsive to any needs during office hours and email. :: Yes"
1833,Scott Thomas,2017 Fall,ME 3320,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is an amazing professor. I wish more professors would teach the way he does and cares about teaching. :: Scott needs to teach a class about how to teach, where all other professors are the students. I learned a lot, I loved the class, and I would recommend Scott in a heart beat. :: No. :: One of my personal favorite professors in the ME department. He genuinely wants you to succeed in his classes. :: No. :: No further comments. :: You're a beast scott. keep up the good work. :: Scott does an awesome job! Keep up the good work!. :: He is a great professor and would recommend my peers to take him. :: yes. :: I don't agree with the exam blue book policy. In a class that stresses fairness, the idea that a student that didn't study can simply move the weight to the final really puts students who did study as a disadvantage. Not turning in the blue book skews the average and eliminates any potential for a curve.  It's also evident that difficulty of exam questions are based on the class's exam average. If the exam average is high on exam 1, students can predict there being a much-harder-than-normal problem on exam 2. It doesn't help that students not turning in a blue book can influence the next exam by skewing test averages. Not entirely fair, Dr. Thomas. Other than that, Dr. Thomas should teach a class about teaching, teach it in his style, and WSU needs to force all CECS professors to attend it. :: Professor Thomas is good with utilizing class time efficiently. He ran through practice problems for most of the class time which I feel is very effective when trying to learn this type of material. The only critique would be that he sort of assumed that everyone was on the same level and covered the same material in Thermo 1 since he taught that as well. So it wouldâve been nice if we couldâve reviewed the key concepts in the beginning more thoroughly. :: Scott is a great professor and I enjoyed having this course with him. I hope he doesn't change. Probably my favorite teacher. :: Dr. Thomas is a great professor and cares deeply for his students making sure they understand the material and have fun learning. :: One of the best professors I have had throughout my college career, who actually cares about his students. :: I very much enjoyed having him as an instructor and I cannot wait to have him again. :: I enjoyed the class and material presented by Scott. He did a great job and kept the classroom involved with humor. I believe that the jokes that Scott told the class help the class pay attention in class."
1834,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not very effective at all. Constantly argued that he was right about every question until shown in the book he was wrong. Never helped students review or understand how to solve problems at the same level as the ones on his exams. :: Amir spends his lectures completely reading definitions from the textbook with little example problems. He does not do a good job preparing you for future related courses at all. :: Very good at explaining theory, but reads straight from the book for anything else. Lessons do not help with homework. :: I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class. I learned more from the book. He just writes things straight from the book he doesn't add or make learning any material from the book easier. :: Okay instructor. :: Yes, the instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. I am passing but, I have struggled in this course so far. In class we pretty much go through the chapter with very little examples which makes it hard when the homework is not conceptual questions only math problems which we hardly ever go over in class. The only reason that I am passing the class is because one of the three questions on exams is conceptual question which is weighted the most on exams. Need more examples in class and less conceptual notes. :: not effective at all. I probably have to take it again due to his class structure and test structure. None of the examples  from our homework assignments nor what was discussed in class were on the exams. :: didnt learn a thing. :: Dr. Farajian was not an effective professor. For most of the semester, he was showing up late to class anywhere between 2-15 minutes late. Our first exam we had, he was 15 minutes late and kicked us out of the room right at 4:30 which was our end time. During lecture, he did mostly theory and barely any examples. Our test grades were not that great because we had little experience with working problems. It wasn't until after our second exam when he finally listened to us and started doing more examples in class. Although his examples were always a problem he would have us work out of the book with our tables and give extra credit to the first table to answer. Most of them he wouldn't even go over how to do after someone answered. :: very poor, learned nothing from his lectures. :: bad. :: I didn't really understood him had to read the text book a lot to better understand the marital. :: Dr. Farajian has been the worst professor I have ever experienced. Class always started 5-10 minutes late everyday. His lectures consisted of scribbles of vaguely  summarized formulas from the textbook, and he also never worked through a single example problem during his lectures. The only problems that were discussed during class were worked through amongst our table ""groups"" with only a single answer stated by the professor. Dr. Farajian never once worked through solution to any problem for the duration of the course. these are just facts of what has happened. His demeanor was terrible. the professor came off as very arrogant and unapproachable. :: Dr. Amir Farajian is a very nice and intelligent professor. He understands the topic he teaches. Over all his form of teaching was not effective for myself or the class. The questions he asked where usually hard to understand and then answer. The other struggle facing his students was a clear expectation with the projects and the exams. The final problem I had was the projects we had before each exam. These projects where a good source of points, however, he was not clear on his expectations and when the projects was complete and turned in, it appeared he didn't read them; just used turn-it-in to evaluate the project. I am under the impression that this class is not supposed to be taught well as a sort of ""weed out class"". :: The instructor was ineffective in grading papers and getting them back.  Also, he rarely would respond to emails.  He was effective in his teaching. :: I thought this teacher did a very poor job teaching the material. :: When doing these course evaluation surveys I often go through them quite brief; However, Dr. Farajian's performance MUST be addressed in every manner and so I will do my best to fully explain my experience for every question.  For the overall effectiveness of this instructor: Dr. Amir Farajian has been the least effective instructor that I have had in my three years of college for engineering. I am not evaluating this decision based off of any personal emotion, but by comparison of other professors in my past experience. Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. Dr. Farajian did not have any plan laid out for the class and had no dates set for class assignments, quizzes, or even grade returns. His plan for lecture was to bring in a text book and go through/skip specific parts (he explained only as much material as the book did, rarely went into further detail). If questions were asked beyond the books material, the answer would be both scarce and questionable, almost hesitant. Almost all of the material handed into Dr. Farajian was never returned back to the students, which made it difficult to use for any further studying. As far as grades, students would not receive grades for an average of weeks. (Exams: 2 Weeks, HW: 2 Weeks, Quiz: 1 Week, Projects; 2.75 Weeks). :: His class time is well spent, easy to understand. :: After retaking this class with Dr. Farajian I don't believe I've learned anything new. In fact I feel as if I've lost knowledge from the previous spring semester. Lectures were dedicated to definitions instead of working through problems until 3/4s of the way through the semester when students went to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian to discuss concerns for the class. Only after that were examples done in class at a slightly increased frequency. I understand it's Dr. Farajians first time teaching this class, but I did not find the way class was conducted to be very effective at all. :: Dr. Farajian does a good job explaining the theory behind thermodynamics. :: He needs to be evaluated. He does not know how to teach at all. :: He knew the material well. However class time was not spent effectively. He showed up late to class for the majority of the semester. We never finished all the material we were supposed to cover. He did not give back graded exams. Students had to come during the thirty minute office hours to look at their exams and then hand them back over to the professor before leaving. The professor always kept the exams, even though it would have been more beneficial for students to get their exams back and see the solutions. He was very ineffective. :: He made sure that we knew the concepts. He also made us do projects that did not help us with our learning in any way. :: less effective than reading the notes from the book a classmate took while drunk. :: Anything Amir said or taught in class was 90% of the time just a paraphrased version of what was said in the book. Going to class was often no more helpful than simply skimming the material on my own time. :: no. :: Poor teacher, reads straight from the book and covers few examples.  Never covers how to use charts in thermo book properly.  Consistently late to class and canceled class multiple times, barley finished one chapter for the final section of the class which was supposed to cover 3 chapters."
1835,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- no. :: Yes. :: yes, grading was outlined well in the syllabus. :: His syllabus needed a grade scale and also for the projects a more descriptive rubric. :: Mostly. Group projects weren't clearly defined in the syllabus and no information about presentations/presentation grading was giving. Number of exams/projects/homework were mostly as expected. :: Yes. :: no h. :: yes, lenient. :: There were many things that he did not put in the syllabus that we were unaware of grading wise. For example, we had 3 projects we had to complete throughout the semester. Our first project was a disaster because the only thing in the syllabus was the requirements of the paper (i.e. single spaced, 12 point font, times new roman, and each table member had to write 2 pages.). There were no guidelines for our PowerPoint presentation that had to accompany the paper and we did not know how things were going to be graded. A lot of people didn't do well on the first project because we did not know what he was wanting and he refused to answer questions about it until after the first project was done. :: not at all. :: no. :: yes. :: the weight of the different types of work in the class are accurate but the professor did not execute the course well at all. :: He evaluated our work based off of loose expectations that were broadly misinterpreted. :: Yes. :: no. :: Dr. Farajian's syllabus was both limited and was not followed in certain areas. The biggest issue with the course syllabus, which I witnessed but did not encounter personally, was that the syllabus was very extensive; When students would bring up issues with how their projects were graded Dr. Farajian would use the syllabus and it's gaps in the instructions to support his grading marks. Although Dr. Farajian has the right to grade how he seems fit, I do not believe it is fair to the students to bend the syllabus after students have already completed the project and received a bad grade. :: yes. :: Yes, the course syllabus described the expectations for the course thoroughly. There were a few times in which we needed clarification for the expectations though. :: yes. :: His way of grading is beyond me. ive never seen anything like this class, its a joke. on our second project he told us we got 5% taken off because we didnt look prepared walking up to him. even though we answered every question he threw at us and confused him because he didnt even know what he was asking us. we recieved a 95% on that project i feel as though he was mad at our group because we out smarted him. :: Yes. The syllabus did not give much information. The instructor did not get through all the material that the syllabus said we should get through. :: The projects were not graded in the same way the syllabus explained. The grades were arbitrarily graded based on the originality report and the way we answered questions during our presentation. None was based on the technical content of the paper. :: no. :: Homework and exams were graded fairly, but Amir never gave us a syllabus for the projects, so the grade distribution for them was unnecessarily all over the map. :: Expectations were not clear for the first two midterms.  It would be helpful to have point values assigned on the exam for each question. :: no"
1836,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No. Was consistently 10-15 minutes late. :: Absolutely not. He was between 5-10 minutes late nearly every day. :: Was never on time to class. He showed up 15 min late for an exam. :: He has been on time once this semester. Other than that he was late everyday. :: Usually late to class and then had to take time to set up projectors beyond already being late, which took up a significant amount of time for a 55 min class. :: No, on multiply occasions he was anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes late, including on the day of our first exam. :: Has been 5-10 minutes late the whole semester only on time these last few weeks. :: definitely not. many many times class started more than 15 minutes late. He was actually 30 mins late to the first exam!!!. :: half the time 5 minutes late. :: I believe there were 3 classes total this semester that Dr. Farajian showed up to class on time. As stated above, he was almost always late to class. :: nope usually late. :: no always late. :: No was sometimes late to class. :: class was always 5-10 sometimes 15 minutes late and class time was poor utilized as well. :: yes. :: The teacher would show up around five minutes late most days. :: no he would usually come in late. :: Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. :: yes. :: Again, until about 3/4s of the way through the class he was nearly always late. Students even ended up guessing each day how late he would be that day. Even for our first exam he was 10 minutes late. Since speaking to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian, he did start coming pretty consistently on-time to class. :: yes. :: no, he was never on time I stopped counting after Thanksgiving but he was up to 170 min of being late. :: Almost never. There might have been 2-4 classes that he started on time. Towards the end of the semester he realized we would not get through all the material so he showed up on time to class. :: Quite often he was late by 10 minutes. He was even 10-15 minutes late to our first exam. :: he was late so often we would as a class we would each mark on the white board how late we thought he would be. He needs a new watch more than he needs to be replaced as the instructor of this class. :: At the very beginning and end of the semester, he would begin and end class on time, but during the bulk of the semester he would arrive 5 to 10 minutes after class was supposed to have started. Throughout the semester, regardless of whether or not he was on time, he often spent an unnecessary amount of time discussing semi-relevant information about the upcoming assignments. :: The first portion of the semester was rarely started on time (5-10 minutes late). This improved the second part of the semester. :: for most of the semester he was always late to class to the point the class started to bet what time he would come into class that day. :: NO, professor was almost never on time to class."
1837,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He didn't. :: No. Whenever you ask him a question, his answer would always lead up to him blaming you for not knowing the material. :: He was interested for the first few weeks of class, but became less and less concerned with how much we were actually learning. :: HE DIDN'T. He just came in wrote text straight from the book on the board. I would have been better off taking this course somewhere else like Sinclair. :: Extra credit opportunities that encouraged solving problems and answering questions in class. :: No he seemed to lecture only reading out of the book. :: didn't seem to care. just wanted to collect a paycheck. I'm disappointed I have spend my hard earned money for this instructor to teach me absolutely nothing. :: somewhat. :: He would always tell us we need to pay attention whenever someone was talking about an idea because ""it is all very interesting stuff"". He seemed to enjoy teaching the subject and always told us this is a great class for engineers but I am not too convinced he cared about our interest in the topic. :: very belittling. :: not good. :: By giving out projects. :: there was no interest in our learning. the professor was very unapproachable. :: There was more of an air of frustration in our learning than an interest in our learning. :: Yes, I believe he did.  He asked conceptual questions to test our understanding of the subject. :: no. :: From my observations and personal opinion, there was no interest in my learning. Many students, including myself, expressed our frustrations and concerns towards our experience in Dr. Farajian's class and they seemed to be almost disregarded. :: He tried to carry everyone along. :: He demonstrated interest in a strange way. During class he would ask us questions and try to get us to answer them. The issue was that his questions weren't clear so we had to keep guessing wrong until he further clarified what he was trying to get at. Unfortunately that was also true for our group projects and the lack of clarity ended up affecting our presentation grades. :: By listening to each individual groups presentations for projects three separate times throughout the semester. :: He would give you a sneary look if you asked a question then would say see me after class if he didnt know it. :: He told us what important concepts we needed to understand and posted homework solutions. :: He gave a lot of extra credit even though it was difficult to earn sometimes. :: He didn't. :: To his credit, he encouraged us to research somewhat obscure, unconventional topics for our projects. :: he didnt at time. :: Demonstrated zero interest in my learning."
1838,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Was very poor with communication and failed to answer any email with questions regarding the course or course material. :: His office 'half-hour' once a week is not nearly enough for the courses he is teaching. He refuses to hand back exams and says that to see our graded work that we need to go to his office, but there is almost always a line of people waiting, making it almost impossible to see him in time. :: He was not a fan of questions in class because it put him on the spot and would just say see me after class. :: He has an accent which is okay. But sometimes his accent drowns out what he's trying to get across so you just blank out. :: Occasionally had a condescending attitude towards students when speaking with students during class time and in office hours. Wasn't great at answering questions in class. Would often tell student who asked the question to speak to him after class when the question and answer would have benefited the whole class. :: very poorly. :: no comment. :: terrible. :: He never responded to emails. I had even been to his office to talk to him and I'll ask if he received my emails and he actually told me that he does not answer emails. He was always available in his office though to answer questions and I had been to see him a lot this semester. :: ok. :: terrible. :: exam schedule and location was shady and not upfront. emails were sometimes unresponsive. :: His communication was better one on one than in class. :: In the classroom, he did a good job of going through the material and was available after class to talk to.  Outside of class, I know students had problems with the instructor not responding to emails. :: Very poorly. :: There was very little communication between the class and Dr. Farajian. I believe that observing his communication with certain students who attempted to voice their questions or concerns forced students to keep their questions to themselves, which in return killed the class participation. :: good communication. :: Email is probably the worst form of communication to use with Dr. Farajian. Getting a response was very difficult. However, if you went to his office hours he was much more responsive to your questions and concerns. :: He did fine. :: horribly, very often said there was homework but then wouldnt post it in time so he had to extend it. :: He mostly communicated verbally in the classroom. His communication was not bad. He did keep changing dates for assignments though. :: He communicated pretty well out of class other than the one time he waited until part way through the day to cancel class. :: He was vague and cryptic describing the requirements for projects and insisted that any misunderstanding was the fault of the students. :: He did as well as anyone else reading straight from a textbook. :: No response to emails. :: not very well"
1839,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- no. :: As I said before, his lectures are all just repeated information from the textbook. :: He read and taught straight from the book so yes they were organized. :: Nothing was well organized. :: Yes, but only because the majority of the lecture was copied straight from the textbook. :: the lecture was but it took days or even a week at times to receive grades. :: no. :: all we did was take notes that didn't help for the exam. :: just wrote down the textbook on the board. :: No. He opened the textbook and were lecture straight out of the book. His lecture notes were hand written in paint on the computer and we could barely read his handwriting half the time. It was more beneficial to have the book in front of you and read along to what he was discussing. :: not at all. :: no. :: Sometimes but it was really simple and straight forward. :: unorganized. :: Organization is not his strong suit.   I am used to more presentation than the projector work he did. If it was not for the in class participation, I think I could have done most of the work on my own at home (e.g. definitions, example problems) the useful content was his derivation and inclass clues to some of the things he felt were important to learn. :: yes. :: Just followed exactly as the book word for word but somehow managed to make that unorganized. :: The content and lectures were organized in the fact that the routine was the same everyday; Dr. Farajian was late to class, he would open his book and begin reading from where we left off. However, not all material was covered and the amount of material we covered would range from day to day. :: yes. :: Lectures and content were organized for the most part. :: yes. :: not at all. :: Not at all. We did not finish the course material. There were discussions that took place in class, but ended up in a lot of wasted time. :: I think they were well organized. :: no, they were not. :: Yes. They were organized by the authors of the textbook. :: Course content followed the textbook. :: yes but they were just out of the book and you could have not come to class all semester and learned the same stuff. :: No, professor just read from the book and spent the whole class copying formulas straight from the book.  Even when going over the few examples coverd he would just write the answer with little explanation of how to do the bulk of the work required to get the correct answer."
1840,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- no. :: Nope. See above answers. :: Never went to him outside of class. :: Available for office hours, but very poor email communication. :: No. :: I didn't want to contact him at all. :: yes. :: This was his one good quality is that he was always available during his office hours to talk if needed. But as I mentioned above, he never responded to emails. :: no. :: no. :: Yes. :: less than most professors, mostly doesn't respond to email. :: i never went to office hours. :: It is a rare thing if he replies to an email. :: Dr. Farajian would stay after class for a few minutes to answer students questions, however his treatment and answers given to certain students deterred me, personally, to see him during any further hours. :: yes. :: Email, again, was just a hard thing to use with him. I would recommend having maybe another hour worth of office hours in the future. Office hours were only for 30 minutes each Monday and Wednesday which didn't feel like nearly enough time. :: yes. :: 60/40 chance of seeing him in his office. :: Yes, he was helpful during office hours and he answered an email of mine promptly and helpfully. :: I heard that he wasn't because he only had 30 minutes on two different days but he was in possibly two different rooms. He should have had more office hour time. :: I did not meet with him out of class due to his consistently condescending tone in response to in class questions. I worried that he might begin to arbitrarily dock points from my projects and tests as a punishment for taking his time. :: He was routinely difficult to contact outside of class. :: No response to emails. :: no"
1841,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I would strongly recommend a recitation section for this course, I feel like it would greatly improve the students understanding of the subject. :: Gets very frustrated and likes to argue when students have questions about material that he doesn't want to answer during class. :: Thermodynamics is a hard course in general so why would wright state not have a recitation for this course. Also there should be more teacher options for thermodynamics. :: This isn't a terrible class, but definitely needs some improvement. Exams weren't reflective of the range of material covered in that section. Only a couple topics covered for a very large amount of content covered in class. Expectations from students for this course are not comparable to credit hours associated with this class.  This class definitely didn't seem like a priority to the instructor because he was usually late to class, didn't return any grades in a timely manner, etc. :: He should be seriously reviewed and evaluated to see if he is fit to teach. :: I wish I could get my money back for this class because it was a waste of time and money. :: I can tell it was his first time teaching, disappointed I paid lots of money for such bad teachers. Shame on the engineering dept for cutting sections of everything, and making classes so big due to their debt while the students suffer. :: teach better next time. :: bad prof. :: Nope. :: Amir Farajian should not be a professor at Wright State University. He gives WSU a bad name and makes students feel as though they have wasted their money. :: I felt the class was more challenging because of the professor than the content. :: no. :: Terrible teacher. :: I am writing this evaluation in the hopes that both Dr. Farajian and the Dean of Engineering will truly read this evaluation. I do believe that Dr. Farajian's attitude, knowledge, and efforts should not be accepted at Wright State University and my experience in his class has made me struggle with continuing my education at Wright State. However, I have had many great professors at Wright State and I will not allow Dr. Farajian's class to reflect on the entire Engineering Department. :: Yes, the content of thermo 1 is broad, exams reviews should be made specific on the particular kinds of question that will be asked on the exam. Recitations should also be added to the lecture to aid student success. :: As frustrating as this semester has been, I think Dr. Farajian is a good professor. There has just been a general level of frustration for the students in the class with him. I don't think Thermodynamics I should ever be less than an hour long class. There is far too much content to cover for the classes to be 55 minutes long. If I'm honest, I wish I had taken my money to Sinclair over the summer and done the class. I've heard nothing but good things for Thermodynamics from people who took it at Sinclair. I feel as if our school should too have that reputation for being the go-to for these kinds of classes. Thanks for reading and considering my criticisms. :: no. :: i would highly recommend evaluating him as a professor because it has ruined alot of peoples views in my class of wright state and a large majority are talking about transferring because of this experience. :: Thermodynamics needs a recitation. In class, all we learned were concepts. There was an occasional question at the end of class which we were supposed to solve in groups. The exam had one conceptual question and two problems to solve. I did not like how the exams did not represent what we learned in class. If there were a recitation, then we could learn how to solve the problems and more people would have a strong understanding and pass the class. :: There were some people in the class that disrespected the professor. People believed taht he did not do well teaching and preparing us for the exams. However, I did fine on the exams without studying much just by paying attention and writing all of the equations from class on my allowed cheat sheet. He is not a terrible professor. He is pretty okay as a professor. :: It would be more productive to have the text(which was infinitely more helpful than Amir Farajian)  for the class be an assigned reading and take two midterms and a final just based on that than to sit through Amir Farajian's slow and lazy regurgitation of the book. It was extremely apparent that the requirements for the project were so vague and unhelpful because they were hastily and thoughtlessly assembled. I would much rather take this class with a student in thermo 2 than with Amir Farajian. :: He seemed like a nice guy at least. :: no"
1842,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The professor taught directly from the book and was not very good at explaining concepts in terms that were easy to comprehend. Tests were mainly derivations that I personally do not feel we were prepared for. The class range for exams was 30-100 % and there was less than 15 people in this class. Homework did not make sense, and class structure was hard to follow since notes were drawn all over the place on a projector screen. Numerical examples given by the professor were not helpful. His syllabus is not clear. More on that in the next section. He would ask the class if what he said made sense, and most of the time classmates did not know what to ask to understand the material. I feel as if I learned nothing, and had to jump through so many hoops for this class because of the Instructor. He is a very smart person, but he is not an understandable instructor. :: excellent. :: Low. Most of class was spent doing conceptual and not much practical application was done. The low number of homework assignments didn't help. I felt really lost on the exams because they didn't seem to have much relation to what went on in class. I don't feel like I learned a lot in this class. :: Honestly, I did learn about four laws of thermodynamics and how they apply to different systems, but it was just a basic understanding.  When going in great detail in this class, many of my classmates and I were completely dumbfounded.  It is difficult material.  If the exams were easier, I would feel much more comfortable taking this class.  I always felt like I was lagging behind and didn't quite grasp all of the topics discussed. :: The instructor is very intelligent, but the effectiveness of his teaching in thermodynamics of materials is hit or miss.  The majority of the class was spent deriving equations which we rarely ever used, and is almost entirely copied word for word, letter for letter, from the book, which is not a very good book to begin with.  If you are unable to understand the book, he offers nothing extra in teaching the subject. Following along with his lectures in the book will help understand what he is doing, but it does not really teach thermodynamics well. :: Not effective. His lectures were just him writing the book on the board with no further explanation. The entire class regularly discussed how they haven't actually learned much of anything and expressed how they will avoid him like the plague in further coursework. He basically only taught theory and never worked through examples. All of WSU engineering experience has been learning the why, and then working through problems until we understand how to solve stuff we may encounter. He just had us write derivations all day and that was pretty much it. :: Awful. Taught straight from the book. The book was already hard to understand and him teaching the same method did not help in my learning. This is my least favorite class that I have taken during my entire college career due to the fact that I did not understand what the material throughout the entire semester. :: Moderately effective. Feel as if I have to teach myself or not understand. :: I, and to my knowledge, nobody in the class, really understand the material. Like, we are all still confused about entropy at equilibrium. The professor is clearly smart and knows what he's talking about, but he is not great at communicating that information. :: Dr. Farajian is an amazing professor. The best part in his teaching, he explains the basics so well."
1843,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I think that valuable information is missing from his syllabus about group projects. Based on what the syllabus says, he did not evaluate group projects correctly. Only after the assignment,did he elaborate what was actually required. Which was not mentioned in the syllabus. :: good. :: Yes. :: Not exactly.  It was much more lax than I anticipated. :: Yes, however, the syllabus is very vague, and many groups did not understand what the expectations even were, mainly for the papers and presentations we had to complete before every exam. As an example, there is no outline for what a ""good poster presentation"" is, however you are graded on the poster presentation as if you know how to deliver one already. :: sure. :: No. Never gave any feedback on work. Would take 4-6 to grade anything. Very unorganized class. The syllabus was poorly written and hard to understand what was being asked to do. The exams are nothing like the class or the material in the book. There should be more prep for the exam because we usually have no idea what to study for the exam, the worked out numerical examples are nothing like the exam. Some times there were sections of material that we were told would be on the exam and it would never be on the exams. :: Not really. Was very lost most of the time when it came to his grading and evaluating. :: Possibly. We never get feedback on our work. :: Yes he did."
1844,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, he was even late to tests, and did not have tests prepared. That was not fair to us, nor appropriate. :: yes. :: Aside from being late for the midterm exams (like, really, the only classes you were late for were the exams? come on) yes he was on time and used the full class time. :: During lecture, yes.  There was a time when he was 25 minutes late to an exam, and we were still supposed to turn it in at the end of the set class period.  That was a bad day. :: The instructor was late on occasion, due to him having another class 10 minutes before our class starts.  During our first mid-term, the instructor was 30 minutes late to class, and did nothing to help students complete the mid-term in the shortened time given to us due to his absence. :: No. He was 5-20 minutes late for every single class and was 30 minutes late for one of our exams and then criticized the class for not getting it done with 30 minutes less time. :: Yes. Usually used entire class for teaching. :: Routinely, yes. Was late but it was because of another class of his going over. :: Class started on time when we didn't have exams. During tests class would start 10-20 minutes late. :: I think there were two occasions he didn't start the class on time, it's not because he was irresponsible but he was discussing with students from  the previous class. So that's totally cool."
1845,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He would routinely ask if we understood the material, but he never really answered questions in an understandable way, so I resorted not asking and seeking help online after class. :: he did it very well. :: Answered questions in class. :: He talked with us about real world applications of the materials we were learning and will eventually learn. :: The instructor asks a lot of questions for the class and wants each student to understand the material, however as I stated before, the material is just deriving equations, not really much actual understanding of the physics or thermo itself. :: He didn't really. :: None. Did not respond to emails in a timely manner. :: Cared enough to go out of his way to make sure my accommodations were met during testing. :: He expected us to go out and find information rather than just giving it to us. That would be great if we didn't have other classes and work. :: He find different ways of explanation for the same concept to help me understand better."
1846,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- I honestly did not understand things and was confused by almost everything that was going on. I mainly get As and understand material, but his responses never made sense to me, and even when he would elaborate, it made it more confusing. :: very effectively and made sure everything is going well. :: Sent out emails with information, told us of homework assignments in class. :: In the classroom he communicated effectively.  Outside of the classroom, however, I found it a little difficult to understand everything that was expected. :: The instructor took quite a long time to grade and return any homework, papers, or presentations that were done during the semester, however he was available whenever needed via e-mail. :: He didn't really teach the material, more like regurgitated the information in the book. The class doesn't really require much out of class communication. If by this you mean ""did he respond to emails?"" then yes he responded actually pretty well. :: Not. He is very knowledgeable about the topic but does not know how to teach information to students. He would write every equation from the book (even though most were just the derivations of the final equation). Although this class is mainly about entropy and enthalpy and other thermodynamics, I still do not understand the key concepts of this class. They were never explained in a way that I actually understand, even when asked multiple times. :: Well. :: Needs better handwriting- at times it is illegible, especially when using the computer. :: On a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 7."
1847,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I really do not think so. Teaching straight from the book with no supplementing material does not work with his teaching style. He would ask about our intuition on a concept before he had actually taught the concept. :: yes. :: They seemed to be while in class but we moved slow through them and didn't cover as much material as he wanted too. :: In my opinion the lectures were well organized and seemingly came out of the book.  Passed that though, the projects were all over the place. :: They are as well organized as the thermodynamics book is, which is not very well. :: It was just .writing the book down. :: The lectures were straight from the book. Most days the professor would ask the students if he wrote it down correctly as we looked in the book to verify if he was correct. He should know what he is teaching. The class was very hard to follow along and very hard to understand the material. :: I knew what chapter and section we were on, but felt as if we focused in on things that did not matter and wasted alot of class time. :: I'd guess not, since we are 4 chapters short of where we should be. :: yes, It was."
1848,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I tried reaching out to him, and some of my questions were answered, but not all of them. :: yes. :: Yes. :: In my experience, no. :: Yes, he was available as often as necessary. :: Yes. :: N/a. :: yes. :: Yes, he was active."
1849,Amir Farajian,2017 Fall,ME 3750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I honestly think this class could be taught so much better. Evaluate how material is presented. This is hard material. It does not need to be made harder. :: nope. :: The papers were useless in terms of learning anything. The topics were obscure in terms of actually finding any relevant information about them. You almost made it out to be we needed to be in the lab recording the data instead of trying to find someone else's research on the topic. I mean, ""You can't use that topic, it is mainstream and there is a lot of information on it"" isn't a good reason. We aren't doing ground breaking research in these papers. If someone else hasn't put the information out there, we certainly aren't going to be able to figure it out. We had no idea what was going on and our main goal was to get something on the page. Complete waste of time. :: Good guy, knows what he is talking about, but goes into too much detail and needs to me more clear about what is expected, especially when it comes to grading. :: I believe the instructor is very intelligent and a good teacher, however the design of the class does not promote learning of the material.  Memorizing and deriving a hundred equations is not an effective way to teach a course that, while math heavy, should also have some understanding of its impact on the real world and their implications.  I hope that in the future more time is spent discussing what the equations describe and how they effect the thermodynamics of materials, and less time writing the same equations 50 times with different assumptions. There is also a very very small amount of the course that is materials related, so i am not sure how it differs from the normal thermodynamics class. :: Nice guy, talked to us about how he liked us as a class, but it was very disappointing to spend 15 weeks just transcribing the book to my notes. I think he could be a great professor if he just showed interest in our success and taught at least one example now an then. :: If the professor expects us to write a paper/presentation in less than a week ( with all the other classes that we are taking) it should only take him a week to grade it. For every paper it took him 4-6 to grade the papers and wouldn't let us start the next paper until he graded the past paper limiting the time for us to write the next paper. Although he said he gave us requirements for the paper written in the syllabus, it was poorly written and hard to understand that was being ask/what was required the syllabus needs to be rewritten with better parameters for the paper/presentation. :: Nothing, thank you."
1850,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Instructor was helpful, but the course seem unorganized. I would also like to see more examples of practical application. :: Dr. Mian is effective. :: good. :: Was helpful and much improved from last time I had him gave lots of examples. :: He is a nice guy. :: Dr. Mian was very effective is conveying the information we needed. If there were any questions, he would try his best to provide an answer. Also has a great attitude. :: He was a very good teacher in office hours when attended, but the class was a little scattered after the first couple weeks. :: Moves through content very fast and it is easy to get lost during the lectures. :: good. :: Pretty good, sometimes was hard to follow. :: The homeworks were challenging specially when requiring simulink coding. :: he is the best. :: Confusing lectures, but very nice guy. Always willing to help and explain again and again. :: he is a good instructor. :: he was very knowledgeable about the material. :: Good. :: Dr. Mian taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams. :: very good professor. :: Very effective`. :: Dr. Mian is thorough and more than willing to double back on a concept and reinforce it through examples and more lecture material if he suspects the class doesn't understand. His course and teaching style is easy to follow. :: Great. :: Not very effective, he made a lot of mistakes during lecture which made the subject matter more confusing than it needed to be. :: Good guy. He tries to make things clear and makes classes fun. He's not as organized as I wish he were, but he provides most notes online which is helpful. His exams are straightforward and he tailors examples to it. He understands that students have a hard time learning the material and he tries to give credit where he can to help. :: He did ok but there was room for improvement. He needed to do problems from start to finish and make sure to have solutions and not get mixed up halfway through the problems. He always did what he thought was the ""hard part"" and let us do the rest on our own. Sometimes this was difficult if we didn't know how to finish the problem."
1851,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. I think.?. :: He followed his syllabus appropriately. :: Yes, he based everything off the syllabus. :: Yes, the syllabus was well defined and strictly followed. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes!. :: yes. :: Yes, everything was as expected. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1852,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He was there on time everyday and used every second of the period, sometimes even more time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes always. He'd even go over sometimes which could be annoying but that showed he cared more about teaching the material than escaping the moment he could. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, we used the full class period. This probably shouldn't be a 3-day, 50 minute course as the material is comprehensive and it doesn't leave much time for example problems following a topic. That's not Dr. Mian's fault, just a comment to administrators and course planners. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1853,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Made sure to stop class and check to see if everyone understood the information. :: Yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: He answered questions when asked. :: He was always willing to answer questions. :: He was interested in our learning by stopping the class periodically to make sure no students had a question about the material being presented. :: . :: average. :: By bringing in speakers to teach us about real world applications and proving that ME's will always be needed. :: yes. :: good. :: Willing to extend class, make extra office hours, go at the pace of the students instead of leaving everyone behind. He would always pause to make sure we understand. Most teachers just teach without getting feedback, or even if they do, they just keep going and say ""keep up."" Not Dr. Mian. If the class is struggling, he'll stop and explain to the best of his ability. :: he explained everything well. :: he showed ways to use simulink that i never thought of. :: By showing up. :: Dr. Mian had us work on examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material. :: giving quizzes an homework. :: answered question when i went to his office hours. :: The guest speakers and commentary on applications of the classwork were both greatly appreciated. :: Yes. :: He always encouraged students to ask questions, but did not necessarily answer them when asked via email. :: Yes."
1854,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Had available office hours and was quick to respond to emails. :: Dr Mian communicates effectively. :: good. :: Yes. :: well. :: Very well inside and outside through email. :: He was a little scattered in class because he would not use his notes and get lost in a problem or conduct the solution incorrectly. Out of class he communicated very well. :: He wouldn't tell you class information till the last minute. :: very accessible at all times. :: Very well. :: good. :: very well, always available if needed. :: Very well. Responsive with emails and questions. :: the homework were very useful and related to what we take in the class room. :: he was very flexible. :: Well. :: Dr. Mian used both email and Pilot to communicate well. :: very good. :: effecitvely. :: I appreciated getting an email notification when important material was uploaded, it helps. :: Good. :: Somewhat effectively. :: Well. :: He did not communicate super well. I talked to him in office hours about a group project and he said to email the details and he would take a look at it. I emailed him and never got a response. I then approached him in class and asked about it. He said he would take a look at it the next day. He never responded to the questions and caused me to submit a project that wasn't complete. I had originally asked him about it 1.5 weeks before the project was due and never got a response."
1855,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I don't think the course was organized well. The information didn't seem relevant to engineering so I would like to see more practical application examples in the future. :: Sometimes seems to wonder. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. :: The lectures were organized very well. However, I feel like there was a disconnect between the homework and the lectures. At times it felt like the book was asking for different things than what was described in class. :: No the class was very disorganized after the first four weeks of class. :: YEs. :: yes. :: Could have been a little more structure in the notes, sometimes was hard to follow from the powerpoint/online notes and what was done on the board. :: nice. :: yes. :: Not exactly. He jumps around a lot and can be difficult to follow. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not bad. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Very well organized. :: Yes. :: No, class was sort of all over the place most of the time, with no specific goal for any given class, which is why I believe we were running behind based on what the syllabus said. :: Not great, but not the worst. :: No."
1856,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: He was always available to help. :: . :: yes. :: Yes. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: N/a. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: I did not attend office hours or need anything additional. :: Yes. :: The only time I emailed him, he did not respond, but it was not an extremely important email. :: Yes, always. :: NO"
1857,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I would recommend this professor. He was helpful and engaged with the course. The course structure needs improvement, though. :: I would have preferred a review session on the last day as opposed to guest speakers. The guest speakers were interesting and informative however, they would have been better placed earlier in the schedule so that the last lecture could have been a review. :: No. :: d. :: I have no idea why I had to take this class. it seems completely useless although the same can be said for many of our required classes the methods used are out dated and this is suppose to prepare us for the reel world though it seems to be preparing us for the job market of 1950. :: Excited to take vibrations with Dr. Mian. :: no. :: nope. :: he is the best one. :: One of the most caring professors I've had. He may be hard to follow and understand, but his caring for his students makes up for it. He'll do anything to help us understand. :: no thank you. :: No. :: no additional comments. :: Overall positive experience, would take this instructor again any time. :: Did not learn much in this class, it involves a lot of self teaching. I believe the course could be much better organized, and that the lectures and material discussed during lecture could be a lot more clear."
1858,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. :: Well informed and available. :: Professor exhibits poor effectiveness. Offers no substance for the course and often times seems clueless. :: He is a great professor. :: good. :: Terrible. This is the fourth semester I've had Mian and the third class. He's an awful professor. Nice guy, I don't have anything against him personally. I've never received a bad grade from him or anything like that. He's just awful. He was often late for class. The first day of Capstone 1 he didn't show up claiming he thought the class started at 7:35pm rather than 7:35am. And this is the man in charge of my education. He was the most unorganized professor I've ever had to deal with, taking 5-10 minutes to set up for class, and keep in mind this was after he was late. Can't teach to save his life. Learned and retained very little information. I had him for Mechanics of Materials and because he didn't teach that very well my Mechanical Design 1 professor had to take time to teach us his material. Had him for System Dynamics and that was the biggest waste of time. The material is worth knowing but I didn't learn any of it thanks to him. Oh but I got a B in the class. He doesn't care if we learn, he just wants to give us the grade and go home. :: yes. :: He did a good job of making sure everyone was on track with their projects. :: His being there is pointless. :: Reasonably effective. :: good. :: very kind professor, good communicated with the students. :: good. :: He is a good instructor, but he needs to work on telling the students when deadlines are and when presentations will actually happen. As students, we spent a lot of time in the dark on when things were due and when to pick up notebooks. The times he listed were not always correct and sometimes he forgot to say anything at all. Now that being said, he did acknowledge his mistakes when he made them and tried to correct the ones he could. :: Gets off of track very easily. :: Very good. :: He is so effective. :: Very good. :: Dr. Mian was an effective professor throughout this course. :: he always available to answer any of the student considerations. :: Average. :: Dr. Mian would often wait too long to give us information we needed. He wasn't very helpful as far as providing necessary information. :: Very effective. :: he is perfect instructor"
1859,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I have no idea. :: yes. :: I don't know, it was extremely rare to receive any feedback from the instructor of this course. :: Instructor changed things up a number of times during the course to the point where things were run off of email and not the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He graded as if he didn't even read any of our stuff. We handed in our proposal in the middle of the Capstone 1 hoping for feedback so we could have a better final draft. His feedback was ""Looks good"". Not helpful. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he has evaluated our work based on expectations in the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he did"
1860,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: On occasion. :: Yes. :: for the most part. :: No. :: Sometimes, he would e-mail everyone to let us know that class would be starting earlier or later than planned, or would be cancelled.  It was often confusing, but at least he lets us know ahead of time. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: No. He showed up late. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes the class usually started on time and the full class period was used. :: yes 7:30 am every morning. :: no. :: No. He would often start class late, or cancel. We did use the full period most days though. :: Yes. :: yes , he did"
1861,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he wanted to know how things were going with the project. :: The instructor would ask us if we needed help with our projects. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He didn't, especially not in this class. :: He once looked over some work I did to make sure I was doing it right, and he gave me some suggestions on how to improve it. :: He met with us to discuss project progress. :: Honestly, I feel like a lot of Capstone doesn't need to be taught in a classroom setting. I feel it can be learned outside of class and maybe the students understanding of the content can be evaluated in other ways like proctored quizzes. :: -. :: laughing and many interesting things. :: he made sure we doing what we were suppose to. :: Yes he did, he found individuals to come speak with us about topics that we will run into in the work force. :: Meetings a couple of times though out the semester. :: Held meetings to make sure we understood what was happening and that everything was okay. :: Yes. :: For this course he brought in speakers to talk about our senior design projects and other topics that were interesting. :: well he always available to answer any mechanical related questions. i always go to his office with questions that sometime lead the conversation into another conversation full of useful information. :: set  up regular meetings with our group. :: He met with us each week to make sure we understood what we were learning. He would often ask us questions to make sure we understood the task. :: Periodic meetings outside of class time to check on individual teams progress and help if he was able to. :: he create good stuff to make us learn"
1862,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Semi effectively. :: well spoken. :: Emails were last minute and very poorly times. It was very frustrating. :: Yes.  He communicated well. :: good. :: Pretty awful. Often times we had to email him asking a question that should've been answered weeks prior. We missed or nearly missed a lot of deadlines because either it wasn't on the syllabus or he didn't tell us about them. And while we're on the subject of the syllabus, it might as well not exist. He picks and chooses when he wants to follow it. :: He did a great job communicating. :: Well enough to get the important dates across. :: Well enough. :: good. :: like to hear and listen from all the students. :: good. :: Well, minus when he forgot to tell us due dates. :: Did not answer emails back in a timely manor. Gave due dates the day of with no warnings. :: The emails he sent were a bit on short notice sometimes. For example, at 8am one day he said that notebooks were due at 9 but myself and a few other classmates were already at work. :: yes. :: He was somewhat effective communicating in and out of the classroom. Sometimes he was too vague which did not help us when we needed specific information. :: in class he never skipped any student question, and in emails he always have a quick response if the question sent to him before 11 pm. :: average. :: He would provide emails to let us know of upcoming events or schedules. He would answer questions in class. :: Very effectively. :: very good"
1863,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not really. :: yes. :: No, everything was scatterbrained and poorly structured. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Absolutely not. I'm often very confused about where he's going with something or how he got to where he is in the lecture. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Overall he was relatively organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. There were not many materials covered. This is because it is a capstone class, but anything he taught seemed to be put together last minute. :: Yes. :: yes"
1864,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I suppose. :: yes. :: Instructor had the worst times to pick up notebooks and submit. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 6 out of 10. Not great but could be a lot worse. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No. He took a long time to answer any questions and was not available out of office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was available during office hours and was willing to schedule appointments if we needed help.,. :: yes always. :: I suppose. :: He often would be in his office when needed and would answer questions or provide necessary feedback. :: Yes. :: yes always"
1865,Akm Mian,2017 Fall,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Mian is new to teaching capstone. Our class had no idea what was really expected of us and hopefully this has given him the experience needed for his next capstone course. :: Dr. Mian is another professor in the ME department that should not be teaching. Every class I have had with him has been a waste of my time and money. As long as he remains teaching core classes, WSU ME students will be cheated out of education and money. :: no. :: Start caring about our education. It will help a lot of students out if he actually taught the material versus whatever it is he does now. Get more organized, please. Again, I've never had any personal issues with Mian. I think he's a nice guy. But he can't teach in any way shape or form and he's the worst professor I've ever had. :: No. :: great professor. :: no. :: no. :: Need to give documents sooner then the night before an assignment is due. Also give due dates sooner then what was given. Never any time to plan around work. Most students taking this course are in internships and work on a regular basis. :: Nope. :: yes. :: No. :: i took 4 classes with him and by far he is the best professor. :: Mian is a good guy, but not the best instructor. This is his first semester teaching this class, so it might have been hard for him to make it as good as it could've been. :: No. :: thanks Dr. it is pleasure to take class with you"
1866,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Effective. :: Most of class time is spent with him explaining things from the book with little to know worked through examples. It makes lectures hard to follow and little information can come from them. :: A very intelligent instructor, but wasn't very effective on me. The class made me more frustrated than anything.  He had a very busy schedule outside of class made it very hard to schedule times to meet with him. :: Dr. Slater is very smart. However, he could teach the class more if he would stop trying to impress the class by telling them how smart he is. Bragging on your self is a wast of everyone's time. Dr. Slater knows plenty enough to impress the class by doing examples in class so they better understand the material. :: good"
1867,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, i hope so. Graded fairly. :: Yes, I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. :: yes"
1868,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Started class on time and often went over class period by 5 or 10 minutes. :: Yes, He did go over class time regularly. :: yes"
1869,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Was available for consultation and addressed all questions. :: Mostly just talks. :: Encouraged us to come to his office hours, however it was very difficult to schedule a time to meet with him, because of his schedule. :: Yes, I think he enjoys learning and wants us to learn as well. :: yes"
1870,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Effectively. :: Fine. If you send an email he responds. If you ask a question he answers it. :: Email mainly, but getting a response often took a day or two which was frustrating. :: Dr. Slater was fairly responsive to helping us even with his schedule. However sometime response seemed vague. Also too much class time was spend on him telling about all of his accomplishments. PLEASE DO MORE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. 30 MIN PROOFS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A WAST OF TIME. :: good"
1871,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Not particularly. It feels like he explains things with the assumption that you already know the material and that you are looking to learn more, which is not the case. :: Could of been organized a little better. Manuscript used for the course was often incomplete. The manuscript he gave us did not follow the course content given in the lecture outlines. Equation numbers were different as were page numbers and chapters. Lectures just consisted of him reading notes and equations off his manuscript. Wasn't very helpful. Never went over any examples in class or anything like that. The lab portion of the class was very unorganized. We were never properly shown how to use the lab equipment. A lot of times the equipment didn't work.  We had to learn on the fly how to work it. The lab instructions were very plain (a sentence or two long). :: Yes. However, PLEASE DO NOT USE SLIDES FOR ENGINEERING CLASSES, that is what they do in are history class. :: well good"
1872,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. He misses a lot of office hours but if you want an appointment he is available. :: He was late to appointments in his office hour. Scheduled office hour at a very difficult time for the class to meet. Wasn't very flexible with this. I asked for a tutor or someone i could consult with during the week to get help with the material and he said ""there is no one else who can teach you this material other than me and a guy that doesn't work here."" We took our first exam in September and didn't get it back till over a month later in November. Actually i never received a grade back until about the 10th week of class which is ridiculous. Turned in homework but got no feedback on anything. :: Yes. :: well ok"
1873,Joseph Slater,2017 Fall,ME 7690,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I believe this course is a very difficult class to take let alone teach. Being my first 7000 level class i took as a graduate student i don't believe i really had the prerequisites to take it. I think there should be a class or two before with material to prepare you for the material in this class. Overall a very difficult class. Much different than undergrad vibrations. Class was taught much different. Undergrad class didn't prepare me much for it.  I believe this class wasn't well organized, the instructor clearly knows what he is talking about with the content, but teaches it to us as if we have been studying it as long as him. :: Overall I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. The criticism should be taken as things that should be addressed. But, not that he is a horrible person. I think he would be a great teacher if he made the changes listed above. :: please provide some video lectures."
1874,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was overall very effective,. :: Dr Roberts is outstanding!. :: Great. :: Dr. Roberts covered various aspect of being an engineer. Unfortunately, I feel that I did not learn anything new from what I had learned from a coop.  I had learned the writing guidelines from the Tech Com class. :: i. :: good. :: Kept our team on track in weekly meetings, made sure we were putting in work via lab notebooks, and all around made the capstone class a lot less daunting by breaking it up into multiple parts. :: I enjoyed class with Rory. He was an interesting lecture. He was funny and very personable. :: good. :: good. :: This professor was very effective and organized in this class. He also taught many skills that were applicable to many other aspects of a professional career, not just engineering. :: Very effective. Good teacher, with clear expectations. :: Effective. Lectures (when we had them) were helpful. Got exposed to different areas of engineering. Feedback was good on assignments. Schedule organization could have been a little better but other than that it was fine. :: Love to be in his class. Tho I wish he would keep to the schedule more. :: very. :: Dr. Roberts did a nice job of laying out his expectations and offering a path to achieve them"
1875,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, each item turned in typically had a syllabus to describe what Dr. Roberts was looking for. At times the notebook check may have not been useful, especially in the last week of the semester when everyone is preparing their presentations. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He was good at providing schedules. In addition he was compassionate if you needed extra time to submit something. He understood the pressures of school and work. :: yes. :: good. :: While the schedule did change some, the overall due dates were very clear if students showed up to class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
1876,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. (As much was necessary; capstone is a bit of a different animal when it comes to class usage.). :: Always. :: yes. :: nice. :: Class time was wasted with some of the presenters for my project, but they might have been applicable to the other projects. :: Yes. :: Usually, it was kinda difficult when there were guest speakers but that was to be expected. :: yes. :: Yes"
1877,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor would regularly meet with students to discuss lab progress. :: Very much so. :: Helped us understand anything we covered and wanted to make sure we know how things will be in the real world. :: During meetings, Dr. Roberts would give potential ideas to solve our project. :: yes. :: Weekly meetings, constructive feedback on assignments. :: He was very interested in what we were doing and had bi-weekly meetings to see what our progress was. :: yes. :: yeah. :: He set up weekly meeting with teams to make sure each team was still on track. :: He was very good at making sure everybody was clear on the expectations and just wants to make sure everyone has a fair chance. :: Answered questions during class, responded to emails asking for clarification, met with teams to check on progress. :: by helping with any problems. :: He held team meetings to have a full understanding of our progress and offered insights to help us improve"

1881,Rory Roberts,2017 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The usage of pilot could be improved. Dropboxes were never assigned due dates, and thus did not display on the calendar tab on the home page. The occasional changing of the schedule meant due dates were occasionally unclear. :: Great job, one of the best professors I have had at WSU. :: Great guy and a very understanding professor. :: I had a hard time getting motivated for this class since the material felt like review of previous classes/coops. However, I understand that some students are not able to get exposure to the material covered in class so I am unsure of what a fix could be. :: None. :: no. :: Very organized and helpful instructor. :: No. :: It would have been nice to have one unified set of proposal guidelines/rubric. The example proposals didn't match the rubric and it got confusing at times what was actually desired. Just making sure all those documents agreed would have helped. :: no"

Most classes ended pretty early. :: We did not use the full class period. :: Yes. :: no we ended early most days this was decided by a vote of the class. :: The class almost always started on time and we were usually let out of class a little early each day. :: Always on time but only used the time needed to cover the proper material. :: Yes.

The first few weeks of review did go very fast but then slowed down as the semester went on. :: very effectively, and she was always responsive to emails. :: good, she replied to emails very quickly which was nice. :: Very well. :: She was quick to answer emails and address questions and concerns. :: Perfect. :: She is very friendly and attached so that students don't hesitate to ask questions. At the end of each class she spends like ten to fifteen minutes for questions. Also when we are out of the classroom the best way to reach her real quick is email. she responds immediately."
1887,Shanee Pacley,2017 Fall,ME 4730,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I think she could use a little more organization. I feel that she would lay things out well in the syllabus but once class started she seemed to get a little rushed and skip things. :: Could use improvement. :: They were okay but could have been a little better. :: yes. :: Yes the lectures were usually well organized. :: yes. :: Well organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: This class was one of the most organized ive seen. :: Yes. :: the course content and lectures were perfectly organized and the continuation for each of the chapters made perfect sense.
1888,Shanee Pacley,2017 Fall,ME 4730,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, absolutely. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, she was almost always available and ready to help if a student needed any clarification on the material. :: Yes. :: Was able to help in anyway when confused about class material. :: yes. :: yes. :: Never went to office hours. :: I never had an issue with communication. :: Yes  Very responsive and helpful. :: She replied real fast for our emails"
1889,Shanee Pacley,2017 Fall,ME 4730,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I think as she gains teaching experience and teaches the course again, she will become a great and effective instructor. :: She is nice and she is knowledgeable. Still figuring out how to be an instructor but I think Dr. Pacley will be a great instructor one day. :: No. :: she is a great professor. :: She was a great professor and I truly enjoyed taking her course. She made the class interesting and made it easier to come back each night for the class. :: I really enjoyed this class. I took it not having much interest in the topic but I enjoyed going because she seemed like a rare professor that actually cared if the students learned something. :: I really enjoyed the review sheet for the exams. Really helped to understand what will really be on the exam instead of studying unused information. :: Dr. Pacley is an excellent instructor and I enjoyed the course very much.  Lectures were interesting and helped my understanding of the material. :: nope. :: Please teach more classes at Dayton. :: She is an awesome instructor. :: She is too good and an awesome instructor"
1890,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor is very effective at teaching this class. :: The material was taught well and was effectively taught. The class taught some really good applications for use within the field. :: He was good at explaining things, but the class time was very short and the lecture type discussions we had were done while everyone was standing and not many notes were able to be taken. Other than the limited class time, the instructor did a good job at answering and responding to questions, and was prompt about refilling supplies as they were depleted. :: Very effective and engaging when explaining lab methods and safety. :: Dr. Young is an excellent instructor, covering what needs to be done clearly and concisely, and explaining in depth why the students are taking the actions they need to take. :: He is a great teacher who understands what he is doing. His ability to explain engineering concepts is quite impressive. :: Very good. Explained what was necessary for the labs. :: Very good at teaching the material and providing good insight into the theory, (helped a lot with ME2700!!). :: He is a great professor and does a great job explaining what needs to be done. :: Very effective. :: no"
1891,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, although the class seems like it is the ""red headed stepchild"" of the materials path, and it has not been updated or changed much in a very long time so the labs are a little out-dated or different from what is asked of you. :: Well, currently there are no grades whatsoever for any of the work we have completed, so I'm not sure how well the work has been evaluated. :: Yes, the syllabus was accurate in explaining the expectations. :: yes, grading followed the syllabus. :: Unable to answer as of yet. We haven't received grades back yet, but I feel confident that he will do so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1892,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: For the most part. He gave us a lot of time in class to work on the labs in class, and anytime that he did use for class was for very good teachings on how to use the machines and or complete the labs. :: The class was started on time most of the time, and very rarely used the entire class time. :: no, but this was due to the lab nature of the class so it was still very effective; we could use extra class time for lab work. :: Class time was somewhat amorphous, due to being a rather free-form lab class on our own schedules. If he needed to cover topics with us, he would take the time in the scheduled time slot to speak with the class. Otherwise, the time was ours to work as we needed to in the lab. :: Yes. :: Not always. We often got time to work on our labs. Typical class time was about an hour. :: Yes. :: Yes, he made use of all the time. :: Yes"
1893,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes, he has a passion for materials science and metallography. :: The labs and class were very interesting! It made it very fun to complete and l enjoyed them. :: He made sure we knew what we were doing and answered all of our questions well. :: consistently asking if we had questions about labs, giving thorough explanations, was very available through email or in his office. :: Dr. Young would would explain the what and why of the labs, and was more than willing to answer questions. He would occasionally ask how things were going if we ran into each other in the lab during the week. :: He demonstrated passion and humor to the class and was always happy to help for the sake of our learning. :: He would help whenever he could and often offered advice as how to accomplish a certain aspect of the lab. :: Showing us the results of the lab and what we could expect.  Good incentive/motivation for doing the labs as best as possible. :: he was very interested in what we needed help with and was always there to answer questions. He always gave clear and concise instructions. :: Yes"
1894,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom. :: Very well! He responded to emails fairly quickly and when he was in office he would respond to any questions. :: In the classroom the communication was very good. Out of class, his communication was not as fast as it was in the classroom, but that is to be expected. :: very effective communication both through email and in class. :: Classroom communication was clear, concise, and efficient. Outside of class didn't need to happen that much, but a mass email got what he needed to say across just fine. :: Very well. :: Very well in the classroom. Email would take him some time to respond back. But when he did, the answers were very helpful. :: Good both in and out. :: He did a very good job explaining what he wanted from us and what he expected the final outcome to be. He was always willing to answer questions and responds promptly to emails. :: Very Well"
1895,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The course outline and ""lectures"" were fine, but not exactly what is in the syllabus or in the labs.  I believe this is due to the class never having enough time to actually do all of the labs, so they usually omit one, which leads to confusion when this professor decides to do the last two at the same time. :: Somewhat, some times he was scattered throughout, but it wasn't always. :: Not really, but they were not hard to follow either. The classes were more of a on-the-go environment, talking about things and issues as they came about. :: for the most part; however the first two labs seemed to take way too long and the last two were rushed. The first lab understandably took longer because there were more new things to learn, but we did not need as much time for the second lab as we were given and it ended up rushing the last two labs quite a bit. :: Organization was rather freeform, as the course is mostly student-driven in that the instructor gives the project requirements, explains how you might fulfill them, and then turns the students loose to actually do the work. Whenever there was something that needed to be lectured, though, Dr. Young knew what needed to be said. :: There was no lecture, but rather an open lab. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
1896,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes/. :: Yes. :: Yes, in my experiences he was. :: yes. :: Dr Young was hard to get a hold of in person, as he had his own work he was doing most of the time. He was quick to respond to emails, though, with one time in which he responded to an email within an hour and a half on a Sunday night in the middle of the Thanksgiving Break. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he was usually in his office and was always willing and happy to help us if problems arose. :: yes"
1897,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 2600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- While I understand that experience doing all 4 labs as well as doing the ""fun"" lab, #4, to assign both at the same time with only two weeks left in class, or two class periods total, as well as the large reports that are due with them, seemed very rushed.  Neither lab got the attention it probably deserved and the results of both could have been more in depth if they were done separately. Doing an additional lab, which requires a lot of polishing and mounting and microscopy is not ""fun"" when you also have another huge project due at the same time. :: Dr. Young was an excellent instructor and I enjoyed the course very much. :: I really enjoyed the class, however it was a lot of outside work and consumed a lot of my time during the week in order to keep up with all the work. I think that for a 1 credit hour class, it was a little too much work, and think it wouldn't be a bad idea to increase the amount of hours the class was worth. Also, the labs weren't very well spread out as we have both two lab reports as well as a lab due for this class for finals week alone. Otherwise, the class was very enjoyable. :: Overall this was an extremely helpful class as far as reinforcing learning concepts from ME2700 and learning new lab techniques to put on a resume. However, the end of the semester was very stressful since grades for the first two labs were still not available for review up til the last week of the lecture, and 60% of the total grade was due during finals week. It would be very helpful to get the first lab report back, graded and with comments, before the second lab writeup is due so that we could know how well we were doing with our lab report writing. It would also be helpful for the pacing to be a little more even. :: An excellent professor, and a pleasure to work with. I hope that we might be able to work together once again in the future. :: He is an awesome teacher who does an amazing job. We all had a great semester with him. :: The professor is great, this is a great class, but it's not worth one credit hour. The amount of work we have to do outside of class is not worth the one credit hour. It should be, at minimum, two credit hours as we are to do so much of the labs outside of class. :: no"
1898,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: For his first time teaching this course in a while, I would say it went well. :: This professor did well in trying to explain material and using up the entire class period. However, most of the classes seemed to involve derivations instead of how to apply the concepts to real world problems or example problems. Therefore, a lot of his classes seemed more confusing than helpful. Furthermore, he did not seem prepared for lectures sometimes, that were shown by making math errors consistently throughout the semester. Overall, he is a good instructor and willing to help. :: well. :: Dr. Young is a very good instructor. He presents the theory in a way that students will understand, and provides example problems to reinforce the theory. The only complaint is how scatter-brained his lectures can get. :: Not very effective. Always messed up on examples and spent too much time fixing them in class. :: Mildly effective. :: 10/10. :: excellent. :: Very effective instructor! Teaches clearly and thoroughly. :: Dr. Young was a good professor but he has some flaws that affect his effectiveness in the classroom. I will go into more details about these flaws in other sections of this evaluation. :: Decent instructor overall, covers a good balance between theory and examples of the information. :: Overall, he gave a good explanation of the subject and worked to answer any questions students had. He even would remember to talk about it the next class if he didn't know the answer that class. :: good. :: Henry Young is somewhat effective. The reason I say somewhat is because he get the theory and the example problems on the board wrong so things just get even more confusing. I give him the benefit of the doubt since he has not taught this class for a while. He truly does care about his students though. :: Half the time he was pretty effective and the other half he even seemed confused by what he was saying. :: Dr. Young's teaching style meshed with how I learn best, so in that sense he was an effective instructor. The balance of theory and example problems was good enough for me. :: Not very effective. :: Professor has a good heart and bless it, he tries.  He tries to do examples and things in class to get his point across.  The problem is, he is SO unorganized.  He loses his place, makes many errors in front of the class, has to stand there for many minutes at a time trying to regroup himself and figure out where he is.   But hey, he hasn't given up and he usually tries to clear up his mistakes.  Fair grader. :: Very good professor, we all enjoyed the class. :: Works out problems that you would actually see on exams in class. :: The instructor is very effective at teaching mechanics of materials, and shows a large interest in the subject as well as teaching it. :: The instructor presented the content clearly, defined and explained the theory well and gave ample relevant examples. However there were some occasions where the lectures moved too slowly. Overall quite effective. :: Very scatter-brained. :: He was very effective in the class. :: He was a pretty good professor overall. Probably 3.5/5, would not mind taking again. :: Although a bit unorganized at times, he explains things very well and the train of thought can be very easy to follow. :: I enjoyed Dr. Young's teaching. He always taught with energy and I think that it made the material more enjoyable. He did make mistakes in his math sometimes but he always worked to correct them. :: Somewhat effective. He gave good examples in class and was always willing to answer questions, but he frequently seemed unprepared for the lecture. A few times it seemed like he'd never looked at the notes for that day. :: The teacher really cares about the students and them comprehending the material. With that being said, the teacher sometimes gets off track in his own work and makes many mistakes while doing problems on the board, he does catch and fix them and gives you great feedback on what he expects from you as a student in his class. :: Dr. Young was fairly effective. The lectures were sometimes confusing because he said he hadn't taught the class in a while. At one point we spent two lectures on one problem because he wasn't sure of his notes. I'm not saying it was terrible at all, but a lot of us were confused frequently. :: Dr. Young was very effective in class; he explained everything thoroughly throughout the semester. He often made mistakes during lecture, but these errors had little to no effect on my understanding of the course material, and he was able to correct himself most of the time. :: Dr. Young was fairly effective. I thought he spent too much time working through the theory and derivation of equations making it less effective. :: He is a decent professor, pretty laid back. :: Clear in his speech. Can be scrambled or appear jumbled when solving a problem. :: Dr. Young is a very effective instructor. He explains things very well and helps anyone who has questions. :: Very effective. :: great. :: Pretty effective. :: Good teacher willing to help students out even when he makes mistakes. :: At the beginning of the class, he seemed well put together and organized. He got to the point and taught well. At the end of the semester; however, he was very disorganized, and his lessons are filled with mistakes and errors. This results in standardized equations being copied down incorrectly by students. :: Was not very effective for this course. I have heard he is better at other courses. :: Sometimes a bit messy, but always tries his best to make everything clear and understandable for every student."
1899,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Do not spring a project on students that is not explicitly mentioned in the syllabus. I know it falls under in class activities, but with the other workload from classes, adding something like that at the end of the semester without mentioning it prior is not appropriate. It was a good activity, but I think it should have been mentioned more in depth earlier on. Students have a lot of other work. :: Yes, the professor graded us by all of the standards listed in the syllabus. He gave us deadlines and dates for all of the projects, exams and homework. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Somewhat. A group project was given for the last two weeks of class, without being told in advance. There was a unused 10% of the grade in the syllabus listed as ""in-class activities and quizzes"" which we were never given. This 10% was used for the surprise group project. This project was also in assigned groups, making it very hard to coordinate with group members during the busiest time of the semester when insufficient class time was given to complete this project. Of the two project choices, the content of one was being taught until the second to last class, leaving the students with insufficient knowledge of the subject for in class group work time. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was straightforward in his expectations in his syllabus and he graded based on that. :: Yes, very fair and honest instructor. More professors should follow his example. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes for the most part, however he did say at the beginning of the semester he would give out about 5 pop quizzes throughout the semester and never ended up doing so. Instead he decided to have us do a group project within the last few weeks of the semester. I wouldâve rather he been upfront about what we would be graded on so I couldâve planned accordingly. :: Yes, work was evaluated as expected. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor does a very good job of evaluating  your work based on the expectations he lays out. :: Yes, instructor closely followed syllabus with small alterations based to keep pace with the semester. :: Yes, mostly. The in-class activity was thrown in right at the end of the semester. :: yes. :: I don't have a huge problem with his grading. Exam problems seemed to be graded a little too harshly, but the curves and easy homework points helped make up for it. :: Grading criteria was clear throughout the class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part; however, at the beginning of the semester, we were told that we would be graded on our attendance by having random pop quizzes. He never gave us a single quiz in class. To make up for this, he decided to give us an in-class group design project which would take place of the attendance grade. He did not tell us about this project until mid-November. We were supposed to get 30 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays to work on this assignment, but almost every time we would only be given about 10-15 minutes. Along with this, he did not teach us the material that was needed for this project until about a week and a half before it was due. This gave us only two (partial) class periods to actually work on the project. As a result, most of this last minute ""in-class"" project had to be done outside of class. :: Yes, Dr. Young followed the course syllabus exactly. :: Yes he did. :: Yes, fair evaluator. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the only complaint I have is the lack of explanation of the grades on the midterms. On several problems the only explanation was because he took off that many points for everyone. :: Yes - there were no surprises. Dr. Young was very clear with his course expectations. :: Exams were rough and graded inconsistently in my opinion. :: Although the Syllabus is short, you always know what the next lesson will be about."
1900,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: The professor always started class on time and used the entire class period. At some points he would go five minutes over, which caused conflict with the class following us. However, he consistently utilized the who period for lecture or class activities. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always on time and always used every minute of class. :: Yes. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. We actually needed more time to learn all the material, but Mr. Young was able to teach everything needed in the time allotted. :: Class always started on time and we would use the entire class period. Sometimes we would run over a few minutes so that we could finish a problem that we were working on. :: Yes. :: Class always started on time and ended on time. :: yes. :: Yes, we always started on time and there were a couple of times we left a little early but nothing to worry about. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Always from start to end. :: Yes, the instructor is very punctual. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yep. :: Instructor was always on timed and partitioned classes well. :: Yes. :: While he mostly started on time, there were a few instances of tardiness. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Young started and ended class on time. :: Yes, he would most times use more than the allotted time in class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes almost every class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He used the whole class period, but often didn't finish the lesson. He would have to go over and fix the problems from the prior day. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, only once or twice a few minutes late."
1901,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Dr. Young is very cordial and receptive to questions. He is fair and takes feedback to heart. He even changed the date of a midterm for our class because we voiced that we had several in the same week as his. :: He answered questions readily, and encouraged thinking. :: The instructor demonstrated interest by frequently asking if we had questions about the material. He would stop class to answer any questions and help people in understanding the material covered. :: yes. :: Dr. Young made sure every student understood the theory/example being discussed, and made sure to provide each question asked a suitable answer. :: Was very open to questions and concerned about our understanding. :: Made sure the class understood the content by asking questions, explaining pieces of the lecture again, etc. :: 10/10 Related real world applications to what we were learning. :: did good job. :: Yes, Mr. Young shows a genuine enthusiasm for Materials Engineering and teaching it. :: He was very interested in this topic and it reflected in his teaching. He also related everything to real world scenarios so that we would have a better understanding of the topic. :: Yes. :: How he taught the class showed that he had an interest in the class. He was always passionate about the subject and his students. :: yes. :: He would research a question that someone asked in class if he did not know it and made sure that he would answer that students question correctly the next class day. :: Questions were answered thoroughly. More time was spent on topics considered difficult. Topics the class struggled with were gone over in greater detail, including exam debriefs. :: He answered all questions. :: yes. :: yes. :: Would always stop teaching to help someone with a question, very helpful. :: Yes, the instructor is very passionate about the subject and its impact on your future, and also the learning of his students. :: Yes. Instructor check numerous times to make sure class was following and answer all questions. :: he did not. :: yes. :: Always attempted to answer all our questions, looked up information that he didn't know for later. Seemed to care well enough. :: Henry always kept a good connection with the students in and out of class. :: Dr. Young was always available to talk when he was in his office, even if it wasn't during office hours. That alone made him one of the best teachers I've ever had. :: He was very willing and interested in answering questions regardless of the complexity. He was very effective at explaining concepts as well. :: was always available, answered every question asked. :: He made sure that if we had a question, he'd have an answer by the end of lecture or by the next lecture. :: He made sure everyone understood the material by answering the many questions that were asked in class to the best of his ability. :: Dr. Young would allow adequate time for questions throughout lecture and would stop lecture if a question came up that needed further explanation. :: He demonstrated good interest. :: Was very enthusiastic when answering questions and if he was unable to answer at first, he went back and figured out the problem and made sure we had an answer. :: He was excited to teach us and he was excited when he saw that we were learning. Showed that he actually cared about the education of his students. :: Actively answering questions and trying to engage the class. :: coming prepared to class everyday. :: Very passionate teaching. :: He gave examples related to the course textbook and briefly explained the concept before explaining how to solve the problem. :: Dr. Young was always willing to answer questions, and encouraged them. :: Interested in our learning, but lectures were more theoretical than concrete and exams were concrete. :: I could always ask him if I had a question. (In the lesson and afterwards as well)"
1902,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: Very effectively. :: The teacher responded back to any email that I sent within a day's time. He was helpful in answering questions after class too. However, the one time that I attempted to go to his office hours, he was not in his room. :: well. :: Dr. Young was very clear in his expectations both in and out of the classroom. :: Very effectively. :: Well. :: 10/10. :: effective and good enough. :: He always answers any questions in and out of class. :: Very well. :: Communication outside of the classroom was great. He was always available in his office and through email. However, in the class, communication was a little off. He would be asked a question and sometimes he would answer it fine and other times he would try to answer a question and would end up confusing us more in the end. :: Well. :: Communication was always good in and out of class. :: good. :: He communicated well in and outside of class. :: He seemed lost a lot of the time and tended to get fairly flustered if there was a question asked. He also said that a certain kind of problem was going to be asked on our exam which was never asked so that mightâve thrown a bunch of people off if they were studying that specific problem for a large chunk of time. :: Effective communication all around. :: Very well. :: he is always willing to help. Communicates well in and out of class. :: very good. :: NA. :: The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom. :: Quite. :: Fine. Was late uploading documents that were promised in class. :: Very well. He would send emails regarding homework or class. :: Generally, I understood the points that he was trying to get across to the class. :: well. :: Dr. Young communcated very well both in and out of the classroom. He made the scope of the material we needed to know for exams very clear and was always available to talk when he was in his office. :: He communicated effectively. :: very well. :: Communication was very effective. :: He did a great job. :: Dr. Young was effective in communicating with the class about homework postings and assignments for the design project. :: He communicated decently, it could have been better. :: well. :: Very well. :: Very effective. :: well. :: Very. :: He communicated well. :: He communicated effectively. :: Yes. :: see answer above."
1903,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Not all the time, but again, for the first time teaching it in a few years, I think kinks always need to be worked out. :: The class and content were decently organized. The instructor had material to go over but sometimes the professor seemed unorganized. For some classes he would make many mathematical mistakes that would carry over many class periods and cause confusion. Overall, the professor could improve a little on his organization of his material and what he is teaching. With this he would save class time and confuse students less. :: lecture could have been slightly more organized. :: The course content was very well organized. The lectures were well organized. :: Very well organized. :: Somewhat. Wasn't very prepared for class. Often times didn't understand own lecture notes or would incorrectly copy information from notes to board. Wasted time and made lectures confusing. :: 8/10 Sometimes lectures were a little all over the place or had a few continuity errors. Other than that the lectures were good. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes, but really more time is needed to go over the material better. :: Here is where his flaws are. I do not feel like the lecture was well organized. There were some lectures where he was very scatterbrained and we would spend an entire class working one problem and not even finish it because he would constantly make mistakes. I would not be so upset about the mistakes if it wasn't for the fact that he had the solutions in his hand and still made a lot of mistakes. Some of the mistakes he wouldn't catch until he was at the end of the problem and his calculations wouldn't be matching up. There was one week we spent all 3 days of class going over one problem because he would continually make mistakes. I really wish he would have uploaded his lectures on pilot so that maybe we could have followed along with his and possibly catch his mistakes as he makes them. :: Somewhat, others were more or less so. The more prepared he came the better the class was. :: Yes, everything was well organized. :: yes. :: For the most part. I did not care that it took two classes just to solve one problem. I would have also liked to see a little less theory and more examples. The class was about 65% theory and 35% problems. :: Course content was well organized on pilot. Lectures felt haphazard a lot of the time and not practiced. :: The course was well organized throughout the semester. On a day-to-day basis, some lectures seemed underprepared for (maybe 1/5) which could lead to some confusion on my end. :: Not very organized. :: no. :: yes. :: Somewhat, the lectures can vary in organization. :: Yes, with the exception of the ""final project"" which was only revealed in the last few weeks of class and seemed very rushed. :: Course contact was well organized. The instructors notes may not have. There were a few difficulties and mishaps with working from notes. This was at times distracting and potentially confusing. :: not really - seemed to jump around a lot. Wish there was more examples rather than so much theory worked out in class. :: yes. :: He seems a little scatterbrained sometimes. Sometimes struggled to follow his examples from his notes. In this regard, he could have been more prepared for lectures. :: very well. :: Yes. :: While the content was organized, the lectures frequently felt all over the place or incredibly confusing. Sometimes, it seemed he hadn't looked at the lecture notes before. :: yes. :: Lectures were at times unorganized and left us confused, but I'd say 85% of the time they were organized. :: For the most part. He was a little scatterbrained at times, but overall he did a good job staying on track. :: Yes, they were well organized for the most part. Sometimes, Dr. Young would get lost in the solutions or take up three class periods to explain on point when I could read it or find the equation in the book and have a solid understanding of the concept within 30 minutes versus 2h40m. :: Yes, and no. Some days it would be organized and other days he would have no idea what was going on. :: could stand more organization. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Mainly. :: The content was explained well.  The lectures were explained well but if it were more organized it could have been more understandable. :: No they were not. :: I found providing multiple ways to solve problems spanning over several days to be a bit confusing - but that's partially due to the short class time.  I also believe that providing the equation first, then describing the theory behind it may be clearer. I personally write every thing down during each lecture- but it may have been more helpful for me to know I have the necessary equation down in my notes, then 'soak in' the theory behind it. :: Lectures were very unorganized for this course. Would spend several classes on derivations of equations provided in the book and not enough example problems worked through. :: it was ok."
1904,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, he was, even for questions that did not pertain to his class. :: The only time that I tried to visit the professor in his office hours, he was not in his room. However, the professor was still easily contacted through email. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always available by email and in office hours. :: Yes. :: 10/10. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was always in his office during his office hours and always responded to emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I only went once, but yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he is always available. :: Although I didn't need to spend time in office hours, the one grading issue I had was solved fairly and promptly. :: yes. :: seemed to be. :: yes. :: Definitely. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he was very responsive. :: Yes, Dr. Young was always available for office hours and very responsive to emails. :: Yes he was. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very easy to get in touch with. :: Yes. :: Yes he was"
1905,Henry Young,2017 Fall,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. Maybe. No time. :: Overall, he is a good professor, but he could work on organization of the class and what will be covered on the exams. There were many questions on expectations for exams, therefore, it would be more helpful if he covered more examples and informed the class what topics to review. :: no. :: No. :: Good teacher. Okay class. Lectures always felt rushed and there weren't a variety of examples problems. Usually only had time for one of each type of problem. :: Doctor Young is overall a really good professor. He does a really good job of explaining the material and knows his stuff. The homework and exams can be difficult but reasonable. I would take this professor again for other classes as well, given the chance to. Good Job Doctor Young!. :: No. :: Perhaps with more time and without a student who continually interrupts the class. But these are things against the class and not the instructor. :: Please post lecture material on pilot. It would have helped out greatly I believe. :: Good instructor overall. :: He was a really good professor, but he can lose his train of thought easy. If a student asks a question, sometimes it felt like he got completely lost in class. He would rebound in a couple minutes, but it just make class a little disconnected. :: good. :: Prof Young should write a little bigger on the board and stick to black marker. Also it might be beneficial to run through lectures ahead of time so they are more polished and prepared. :: I enjoyed this course, its content and the instructor. :: I enjoyed the class and the professor made that huge difference. I think the one major thing challenging Dr. Young is time. This is not a 50 min class kind of course. He is so thorough that we could only do one question each class. If class is only going to be 50 min. long, Dr. Young cannot completely convey the entire subject. :: Good professor, I recommend. :: The instructor teaches the class very well, but i do not think this class should be taught in 3 separate 55 minute lectures a week, because that is barely enough time to cover one concept or one problem, and on multiple occasions was not enough time to even finish a problem. :: Well run class, enjoyable, good teaching skills.  The class project was started at a good time but the half classes at a time seemed less convenient then setting a class per week aside for the project. Also I was not aware there was a project till it started. :: no. :: nope. :: Use the digital pen instead of board, it would simplify things. :: I hope I can take another class with Dr. Young!. :: I'd say for our final project, it may need to be changed to content that we have learned up until the date of assignment. We had a week left of in-class time to work and had just learned the material we needed to solve the project. :: No. :: Work more problems. Don't dwell so much on the theory, when Dr. Young could just provide the equation and then walk through how to apply the equation within a problem. I think that'd helped students far more than the theory does. If the students need more explanation, then refer them to the book. Otherwise, Dr. Young was a good instructor and I enjoyed the class and have a better understanding of the structures around me. :: Questions on exams were way too tricky to the point where individuals with Master degrees in engineering got them incorrect. :: No. :: no. :: Good professor. :: No. :: I know this is probably more department related topic, but this class should last much longer than 55 minutes. It's very hard to grasp a concept when examples have to be split over several days due to the time constraint. I think a 2+ hour class would be beneficial to many. :: I feel as though he may have been over burdened by needing to teach this course due to budget cuts. But there also wasn't much structure to his lectures which was a detriment to myself. He curved exams rather fairly when he knew he made the exams too difficult for the time allotted to take them. :: Returning of homework can take a very long time.  He helped me a lot in the beginning to be able to participate in his class."
1906,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr Wolff was an overall effective instructor. :: Awesome teacher. Lots of Respect. :: He is very clear and a great Instructor. :: Probably the most effective professor I've had. Concepts were explained clearly and thoroughly. They were reinforced throughout the semester so I feel that I have a deeper understanding of the material than I do of many other courses. :: Great instructor. :: Very good. :: Good professor. Covers theory and derivations well. Asks questions throughout to make sure we understand. :: Dr. Wolff was very effective in conveying the material for the course. Descriptions of material was presented clearly and thoroughly.
1907,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Grades provided with the work reflect the grading criteria provided with the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes though I would say the course description needs to clearly state that the class has nothing to do with aircraft performance. But rather should be called aerodynamics(air flow) not Aromatics(aviation in atmosphere) that leads us to think it would be aircraft performance. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, evaluation was per the syllabus."
1908,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class was always on time and used the entire period."
1909,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Occasional discussion of outside experience with relevant topics, assuring adequate time for note taking, and confirming comprehension of the material. :: Real world examples. :: Yes. :: He always engaged with the class and was open and accepting of any questions during lecture. Additionally he is very helpful outside of the classroom. He clearly did his best to prepare for the lectures. :: Willing to help during office hours. :: He made sure we had lecture material. :: By assigning projects that were more thorough than book problems. :: Dr. Wolff made sure students understood material and provide relevant examples of real life problems to relate the material to."
1910,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication was overall very effective. :: Excellent. :: Very well. :: Very well. :: Very well. Responded to emails in a timely manner. :: good. :: Well. :: Very effective in and out of the classroom.
1911,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The material was well laid out for the semester. lectures were well put together, though occasionally ran long,. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the organization of the lectures definitely helped me learn the material better. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, lectures and content were very organized."
1912,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor was reasonably available during regular office hours. I have not made a separate appointment, or attempted online communication with this instructor. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Didn't try. :: Yes, Dr. Wolff was available during office hours, and by email."
1913,J. Wolff,2017 Fall,ME 4430,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The end pf semester content was well executed, the tests given during class had issues being too long, and the directions provided with the mini-projects could have been clearer. :: No. :: Just that I feel the course name should change to Aerodynamics. :: Some homework problems and exams required the use of charts and tables that werenât explained during the course of class. Going over some of the plots that can be used for problems would be helpful. :: no. :: Good Prof. Does a good job at teaching important assumptions that are required for different calculations."
1914,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. I have a lot of material in my notes that should prove useful in my career. :: Very effective, but covered a lot of material very quickly which made it hard to keep track of all of the intimate details. :: Fantastic, she knows the material and conveys it in a way that is easy to understand. :: she is very organized with the topics and explains them clearly. :: Dr. Huang is a great instructor and I have learned a lot from her class. She is very good at describing the details and has extensive knowledge of the subject. :: a good teacher, very nice and kind. explain everything well. :: GREAT. :: Very good, I learned a lot. :: Prof. Huang is good teaching from the basic points to core part of the topics. :: Very effective."
1915,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes she graded very fairly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes the instructor stayed on schedule with the syllabus and everything for the class has been in it. :: yes, she is very fair and more than that. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
1916,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Always right on time and lectured until the end. :: yes. :: always. :: Yes. She always started class on time and we stayed the entire class each day. :: yes, the instructor did the timing perfectly. :: ALWAYS. :: Yes, she was always a few minutes before the lesson started in class to always start the class in time. :: yes. :: Yes."
1917,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- I emailed her about jobs in the energy material field and she met with me in her office. :: She actively checked with the students before moving on to new material. :: yes. :: she encouraged student participation by asking questions as she was teaching. :: She always tried to find interesting ways to convey the information and also related it back to other classes that were previously taken. :: yes, i learned everything in this class very well. :: VERY MUCH SO ONE OF THE BEST INSTRUCTORS I HAVE EVER HAD. SHE DOES HAVE A HABIT OF GOING THROUGH MATERIAL TO FAST. :: She provided me with additional information for my presentation and also always had a few minutes of time after each lesson for answering personal questions. :: more practical applications, in class quiz, and other activities. :: Always gave us her time to help us with our questions."
1918,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- quite effectively. :: Easy to talk with in the class room and easy to find in her office. :: yes she always answered questions quickly and effectively. :: always available after class for concerns. :: She did an outstanding job communicating both inside and outside of the classroom. :: she did very well, she would give you her time if some student can't meet class time and office hours. :: GREAT. :: Good. :: yes. :: Always available through email and office hours."
1919,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Very organized came in most days and knew what we should be covering that day, did not have to change the course schedule at all this semester. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. She was always well prepared and organized for each lecture. :: yes. :: Yes the schedule was clear and we always knew befor each lesson what it was going to be about. :: yes. :: Yes."
1920,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: She was in her office every time I needed to get in contact with her. :: yes. :: yes. :: She was always available and would work with you if you could not make it to office hours. :: yes. :: YES. :: As mentioned before, yes she was. :: yes. :: Yes."
1921,Hong Huang,2017 Fall,ME 4570,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- One of the best teachers I've had. :: one of the best professors I have had here at WSU. :: She is a great professor and I truly enjoyed her class. :: she is amazing and everything in the class was understood perfectly. :: One minor issue regarding formulars (which slightly improved throughout the semester)  Whenever a new formula was brought up, not every single variable was explained by her in detail. So I was sometimes a bit confused about which numbers I had to plug into these formulas. :: No."
1922,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective, and was very nice all the time. :: Very Effective. :: Dr. Baudendistel did a fantastic job. He was clear with instructions and was very helpful every step of the way. :: Very understanding and helpful. :: great. :: You are one of the best professors at WSU. :: He was great!. :: Very effective and gets to the point to let yyou know what is needed too be done and always packed the day with a ton of information. :: The instructor shows knowledge of the subject and is willing to learn more and transfer that to the students.. overall effective 10/10. :: Reasonable. :: He is a great professor he does a step by step process of how to do things I know more about solid works than I ever could of imagined and I feel like if someone need me to make a part for them I could make it with little to zero problem. :: After taking his class I feel more comfortable using solidworks and I have a much better understanding of how to use it. :: Helpful and good. :: The instructor did a good job going through examples of topics. :: very good. :: He was very topic based, and was overall a great teacher. He made sure everybody was on task, and doing their work for the day whether that was doing that day's assignments or working on projects. :: Very good at explaining new skills and helping us to adapt to old ones in good ways. :: great enthusiasm with students very descriptive  and brings a lot of energy to class. Best instructor I've had thus far. :: He was very helpful, although sometimes fast, he always gave time for those who didn't understand to catch up. He is very knowledgeable of the subject and explains it well with examples. :: He was a good instructor, he explained things well. Maybe at times a little to fast, but would help you get back where you needed to be. :: good. :: Very effective, fantastic at conveying information. :: He was very thorough. He explained the techniques well and went over them multiple times to ensure the students' understanding, Some of the drawings we received as reference didn't always have needed dimensions, but we were able to figure them out. Overall, very effective at teaching Solidworks. :: Very. :: Very effective in teaching strategies and communication abilities."
1923,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes ! Very good !. :: Yes he stuck very true to the syllabus. :: to the letter. :: yes. :: yes everything that he said he grades he grades well and he will not only grade what you do but e will show you what you did wrong and how to fix it to make it right. He also always goes over the homework to see if you have any questions. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: He did exactly what was asked of us and we worked on exactly what was told to us. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Roughly, yes. :: yes, the syllabus was followed for the most part. :: yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was used as a reference for almost all assignments. :: Yes, our grading guidelines followed the syllabus as expected. :: Yes. :: Yes"
1924,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- He was late a couple times, but that was due to solidworks instruction he was doing to help us. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes !. :: Yes he always started class on time and would have the class the full length but would let the class have time to work on projects for the last half hour. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he always was here for class on time and started right on time, he also taught for almost the whole class and then gave us a little time to work on the homework for the week to see if we had any question. Yeah he made us stay the whole time if we wanted to get some points for the day. :: Yes. :: normally, occasionally class would start 10ish minutes (or between) behind. :: yes. :: yes. :: He did start class on time every class we had with him. He made sure he would have enough time to teach us what he needed to teach and then let us work on our work. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Mostly, someday the last hour was used to work on projects and get in class help on them which was very useful. :: yes. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time, never cancelled and class was used as lab when nothing new was being taught. :: Class always started on time, and usually ran for and hour and a half, with the remaining half hour to work on our assignments with the professor and TA's to answer any question we may have had. :: Yes. :: Majority of the time"
1925,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He remembered my chair design. :: He took classes to learn the program better to teach us better. :: He actively walked around and helped whenever needed. He also communicated quickly and effectively when approached via office hours or email. :: Helped as much as he could and took classes himself. :: yes. :: All the time. :: he would help out and change how he did things to help you out. :: was taking classes on the subject to expand his knowledge to pass on to the students. :: He would always wait for a couple of minutes after he showed every one something for everyone to try it and to see if they had any questions and then he would stop go over and help the student if they have a question. :: We went over how to do everything and he showed us examples on how to do things before he let us do it by ourselves.  He also went around the room helping whoever needed help. :: A lot of examples and answered many questions. :: Although it was a lot of work, he assigned a fun project that applied to the real world. :: very understanding and takes time to address every individual problem. :: He asked us what our majors are and what type of engineering we wanted to do, along with what was needed for each type and expressed interest in what we were doing project-wise and got us through our learning. :: He went to the length of going and taking advanced classes to further his own knowledge of CAD modeling in solidworks. :: very interested and asked for student input quite often. :: He wanted us to learn so we'd be able to accomplish the design tasks. :: yes. :: he helped everyone who was behind during class before moving on to the next topic. :: Yes, I felt that there was lots of information he wanted us to learn. both directly or indirectly. :: Yes, Dr. B was very quick at responding to our emails and always answered our questions thoroughly. :: In many ways. :: Yes"

He was very approachable and enthusiastic whenever I reached out to him. :: Very well. :: yes. :: Very effectively. :: Very neatly. :: He communicated very well in the classroom and outside of the classroom. :: very responsive to questions in class and emails outside of class. :: well. :: He was really good about his email I sent him a couple emails over the semester and he responded to them almost instantly probably with in a day maybe 2 but his emails were always filled with help knowledge on how to fix my problem that I was having. :: Very well. :: good. :: good. :: amazing. :: He sent emails to those who needed any questions answered, and would stay the entire class period, even after if we had any questions on anything. He would also walk around the room to answer any questions given. :: He did a good job of helping us learn things in the classroom and speaking with us, along with that he did a good job of emailing us and updating us on things. :: good. :: Very well. :: Pretty well, if you needed help he would be more then happy to help. :: good. :: Yes, emails were constantly sent to us, students, informing us of what was to come and what would be changing. :: Dr. B was very good at posting updates to Pilot and letting us know of changes to class/assignments. :: Very. :: Very well and very prompt in emailing back"
1927,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: absolutely. :: Everything was very clear and organized. Every lecture was relevant to our current projects/assignments. :: Yes. :: yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes !! Showed us great examples than let us do our work . :: For the most part he went and learned more halfway through the course and taught us stuff which would have been better to learn earlier afterwards because of it. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, they were perfect he made us follow along with him in class Knew what to do and how to do I for homework which was really helpful because nobody had an insanely hard time doing the homework so no one needed a whole lot of help. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, I understood what was being taught. :: Yes. :: yez. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes Pilot was easy to navigate and the course was set up nicely. :: The course was very well organized and the content was great. :: YEs. :: Yes"

1929,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Amazing teacher, hope to have for future courses. :: I would recommend this class under Dr. Baudendistel to anyone who has an interest in the material. Fantastic instructor!. :: Loads a lot of work on at a time. :: no. :: My only suggestion is to be less lenient on the students. As a student who always submits quality work on time and completely, it's irritating to see other students get leeway when they aren't careful about their work or submissions. You defined due dates and the required material very clearly and you shouldn't give out passes because students refuse to read thoroughly. Additionally, if they weren't sure what you wanted, they should contact you. Also, the practical portion of the first exam was way more work than could have reasonably been completed. I find it ridiculous and a little insulting that one of the UTA graders said they completed it in 40 minutes. Maybe make it more clear that you uploaded previous exam material for student to study. Thanks for a great semester!. :: Give him an award !. :: he was an amazing teacher and was a lot of fun to have. :: Just a really great professor and very easy to learn from and to understand all the topics he was teaching. :: No. :: Overall, he was a smart, neat, and nice guy who taught us relevant information for our majors. :: No. :: very professional enjoyed the class. :: none. :: no. :: Excellent Instructor, that I went out of my way to get for the Spring 2018 semester. :: Dr. B is an exceptional professor. He was very kind and understanding when many of the students were struggling to learn Solidworks at the start of the semester. Although he does not know everything about Solidworks, he took great lengths to learn more about the program to pass more techniques on to us. Overall, great professor, very involved, and I will definitely recommend him to anyone considering taking his class. :: He assigns ridiculous amounts of work, and students to do have the skills to complete it."

1940,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3350,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Very strong. :: The professor had respect for students and was open for questions at all times.  He provided good examples and definitely challenged students in thinking about how to solve problems. :: need more examples of problems in class with numbers. :: It is a hard subject to teach, and I think he did a good job of trying. :: Your subject is really difficult, so when students get an average of 60% on the exam, it is because you didnt ever do practice problems on the topics. we get bad grades on homework that is not relevant and is far more complex than test material. additionally, with no numbers on tests, only variables, its impossible to do well unless we have swallowed your format of doing things. thats not learning, that is learning how to pass your exams. :: Doesn't teach from the textbook which is a waste. Uses completely different methods from the book, so you don't have any reference material besides the notes. :: Explanations and example were gone through very quickly though the instructors always stopped for questions. :: I think he does a really good job on being clear with explanations, handling questions, and having the students think. :: The teaching style is great using notes and handouts which allow for a better understanding. I feel there needs to be more examples covered rather than the theory to help explain how to use the theory in a variety of ways. He answered all of the questions that were asked very well there was just not many questions asked mainly for the fact that I believed if you were confused in the class yu would not know how to ask a question to make it more clear. :: This was a very challenging course. The lectures were well organized and the handouts were helpful for keeping example problems organized.  My main complaint about the course is the homework. I understand that assigning homework more difficult than the exam aids in helping you think more about the topic and the problem-solving processes. However, the sheer difficulty of these homework problems was a little ridiculous at times and I do not feel it prepared me for the exams simply because of the differences in difficulty. Yes, it was clarified at the beginning of the semester that studying the homework was not a good way to prepare for the exams, but that still makes the homework a little less helpful overall. I am glad that old midterm materials were provided for studying. That was extremely helpful. :: Very clear, told exactly what you needed for the class. :: Overall the class was difficult. I believe he could explained the material better than just the theory aspect of the course. He did not seem to care to help the students after exams scores were reviewed. He just stated ""we were the worse class he has had"" but has done nothing different to prepare for the final exam. :: NEVER USED NUMBERS. I get it, you can better generalize the problem with variables, but were engineers.  We need numbers sometimes too.  Took so many notes!  My hand felt like it was going to fall off by the end of class. :: Instructor presented content and examples clearly; questions were handled quickly, effective and it appeared with enthusiasm; applications of the content were elaborated as to arose interest and identify objective, this was effective in stimulating thought; instructor was respectful. :: The few examples that were portrayed were unclear to me and there was too much time spent on deriving equations when practical problems could have been done. :: He seemed to do pretty well on all these bases. Examples were always relevant and pretty helpful. :: Examples were very specific and often times hard to apply outside of class. Material taught in class should be less derivation and more application. :: Philippe Sucosky handled questions very well and provided us with good notes that were well outlined. He was always focused on presenting the material so he was neither respective, nor irrespective of students (which is how it should be as his job is to teach us). :: He was very good at giving examples and explaining the concepts of everything. :: The homework was pointless to do because it was impossible to relate to the exams, the only reason to do it was because of the weight it has on your final grade. The exams were brutal and the first exam very little study material and background knowledge on what was expected was poorly laid out. The second exam he provided 5+ exam solutions so we could study them, but had no solutions to them so knowing whether or not your answer was right was impossible to tell.  He did answer questions well, but often exam scores were followed with ridicule because the class had failed to demonstrate the knowledge of a subject that he has so seriously made more difficult. :: He taught pretty well, but sometimes it was very hard to process what was going on because we went through the material so fast.  He did not seem very respectful to his students. He is very arrogant and rude, and he treated us like we were all stupid. :: I thought Dr. Sucosky was very effective in his teaching. He took the time to walk, step-by-step, through example problems to make sure the students understood what was being asked, and what values/variables meant to obtain a better understanding of the material. :: I know that this guy knows what he is talking about, but he seriously does not stop talking from the moment class starts, until it ends. I was not aware that someone can multitask to the point where they can be saying one thing and writing down another. Very hard to keep up with him in his lectures and nobody knows what is going on so nobody can really ask a question. :: Very clear, concise, and well versed when teaching this subject. Master of Fluid Dynamics. :: Did a great job explaining the concepts of problems and general equations. Answered all questions asked with full explanation every time. :: Very good. :: Good clarity.  Would be better if more examples were used for each type of problem. :: When answering direct questions often the instructor would give vague, and unhelpful answers. :: Mr. Sucosky was very clear on presenting topics, though the accent was different for the first 3 weeks. The handouts he provided were very clear and helped immensely. He was constantly challenging us to do better. He treated everyone with respect, even if they did not treat him with it. :: He provides everything you need for his exams and homework. The handouts are directly correlated with homework and he provides enough exam examples to get a grasp on how to solve the problems. Homework is more difficult and lengthy than most courses assignments but if you can do the homework, you can take his exams. :: Dr. Sucosky appeared to be doing his best to teach a very difficult subject. :: He was very clear. If there was any kind of confusion you could always ask him questions and he would clarify as much as he could. :: He goes over the lecture notes a little too fast"
1941,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3350,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Dr. Sucosky answers questions well but does so condescendingly. He doesn't seem approachable although once you get passed the intimidation, he is very helpful. :: The instructor was very helpful in helping me understand the material. The professor would be very helpful during office hours and would encourage people to ask questions. :: somewhat, lecture went so fast couldnt do anything but just copy the notes. :: yes. :: No, he doesn't demonstrate enough examples to practice for the exams. :: Gave many real world examples. Would provide handouts for hard to understand concepts. :: Yeah he would in office hours when he would write on the board and give explanations. :: Yes, he used multiple real world examples which gets you more interested and involved in the class such as showing examples of how a wind tunnel is used and also different real world programs. :: Yes. Lectures were well organized. I liked the handout system for example problems. It is easy to keep the examples separated from the theory notes. :: Yes. :: No, I have had to rely on the textbook to help me understand the material and groups of friends working together to pass the course. :: no. When midterms were taken he proceeded to tell us that we are the worst class that he has ever had and that we gave no effort, and that is why the class average was a 60!  NO BUDDY, THATS ON YOU.  Says he will not curve the grades. BUT HALF OF THE CLASS HAS A GRADE OF A ""D"" OR BELOW.  Sucosky look in the mirror, the problem is a little bit more than you just having dumb kids. :: Yes. :: I thing he tried to make the class easier but through my mind his way of teaching just made things harder. :: Gave relevant examples and was available during office hours. :: Teacher was always available for email and office hours. :: Yes and no. The big problem I have with this class was the difficulty of the homework. I understand and appreciate the need for difficult homework, however I don't believe homework should be exclusively difficult. Rather, we should work up to more difficult problems. By doing only hard problems, the foundation for solving problems is not established. If homework is where the real learning is supposed to happen then more emphasis should be put on the learning process. On the other hand, I believe the tests were very fair and well made. :: He made the textbook redundant. The lectures were essentially a more understandable and digestible version of the textbook, making his lectures invaluable. :: he was available via email and office hours. :: Yes. Everything I learned in this class came from his handouts and our in-class notes. :: Yes, Dr. Sucosky was available during his office hours to answer specific questions or explain concepts not well understood during lecture. He was very patient and would aid in my understanding of the material during his office hours. :: Negative ghost rider. I was treated like an idiot who was not worth his time and then he would answer my question out of pure annoyance and pity. :: Yes, he was very clear and concise with his teaching. He was able to answer any questions on the subject as he knew the material inside and out. :: Yes. He always answered questions well and went into extra detail where students normally make mistakes. :: Yes, by giving full depth explanations into the concepts of the general equations and answering all questions when students were confused. :: Yes, always provided good examples. :: Yes, but understanding material for the homework and exams were very difficult. :: I did not find the format of the class very helpful. Most of the questions we used were all symbolic with very few numbers or simplification. For example the Navier Stokes examples never used any numbers. Instead the integrations and equations ended up extremely complicated. :: He did aid in my understanding. He would answer any questions I had. I met with him multiple times during his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes he helped as much as he could. He was very helpful in office hours and in class. I went to him in his office hours almost every week sometimes twice a week and he was always helpful. He wouldn't just outright give you the answer he would make sure you understood where your mistake was and how to fix it. Homework was challenging, but all of the homework he gave was real-life applications. The real-life application kept me interested and helped me to have an idea of why i was learning fluid dynamics."
1942,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3350,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Professor Sucosky did a great job of explaining material and challenging students. His expectations were straight forward and he was willing to help in any way possible. A tough professor, but one that is willing to help in and out of the classroom. :: nothing. :: I gave a 'D' for my response regarding the materials contributing to my learning for this reason: on the exams we were directly told not to study the hw, or the book, because they were overly complex. But studying only the notes was not quite effective because they were overly simplified. This setup made things difficult and stressful, but feel like I learned fluids. :: I liked him, but at times he can be a little intimidating in his office hours. :: Regarding the homework comments above: What I would have found extremely helpful was one problem on each homework assignment that is similar to the style we would see on an exam. I gladly would have done an additional problem on each assignment if I knew it was going to help me prepare for what I might see on an exam.  I appreciate the old midterm material being provided for us, but the only problem with that is that you do not have the solutions, so you don't really have a way of checking your solutions aside from asking the instructor, which can be inconvenient if 60 students are asking to check work on 5 old midterms with 3 problems each. By putting an exam-style problem on the homework, we could check our solutions to at least one of these problems since the homework solutions are posted weekly anyway. :: hard class, no numbers in class or in exams. Does not explain anything in detail.  Homework is crazy hard. :: none. :: none. :: While the examples and discussions of the concepts were all excellent, the only complaint I have is the complete lack of any numerical problem. While this is likely due to the incredibly theoretical nature of the course, it could have been helpful to see a few numerical problems. :: At the beginning of the semester, he showed us a couple of previous course evaluations that stated that this class was hard and the homework was unnecessarily difficult. He told us that he did not like seeing these statements on the course evaluations, because he gives difficult homework on purpose.  Despite the fact that he does this on purpose and doesn't like seeing this, I'm going to say it anyway. The homework in this class unnecessarily hard, and it takes way too long. I honestly believe that these homework assignments did more harm than they did good; they left everyone confused, and most everyone in the class used websites like Chegg to solve the problems. :: He needs to do a far better job at explaining how to do problems instead of doing nothing but theory for an hour and a half. :: No comment. :: I really enjoyed the class. With a clear lecture and guided handouts, the class was easy to follow and engaging. :: The class was very well organized. I never thought i had wasted time in his class. The material is very challenging, but he gives enough examples to help you understand the subject. He was always willing to help you during office hours, class or outside of class through email. He was very frustrated when students were not understanding the material and not letting him know. During this class i felt as though i was responsible for my grade. Every grade that i received good or bad i earned. He gave plenty of examples and extra problems and was very clear about what was expected of you on the exams. He did not use pilot and quite frankly i thought the format was better. He would send out emails about your grade every week; as a result i was never unclear about what my grade was. Overall, I would definitely take him again for another class."
1943,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3350,Question 14,"Additional comments--- For the help of future students, providing the solutions of past exams would help students learn more. Furthermore, the consideration of time and understanding of how tough some homework sets were, would be helpful. At some points, hours would be spent on a homework set, which would cause more stress than understanding of the material.  Overall, great and helpful professor. He was willing to help and definitely challenges students through those homework problems. He is definitely willing to help students learn. :: none. :: Very professional, which is appreciated. :: stop using old final exam problems as homeworks, this is why students either cheat on HW or do poorly. :: If he went over more examples and provided more solutions to practice exams, the class would be easier to study for considering he doesn't use the textbook. He would be a much better professor if we had more to study and learn from. :: While I wouldn't go back to an open note open book exam, I do think a crib sheet is helpful to both exam performance and student learning as it forces the student to comprehend the material and lay it out in a limited space. :: Very well taught class but I would have preferred a greater variety of examples for each subject to understand the problems better. :: If I had a choice between him and another professor I would not take him again and several of my peers would agree to that statement.  His main focus is research and the theory behind everything. Not problems we would use at a manufacturing company. :: The instructor addressed his french accent as being comical. He was correct. Also, he enunciated sufficiently to be easily understood. :: I thought Dr. Sucosky was an effective professor and I would not mind taking him again for another class. :: Sucosky is an exemplary teacher and knows what he is doing. If there is room for improvement, its making the homework more directly related to what is learned in class, or to focus on the principles and equations of the course instead of their derivations. :: Looking forward to taking him for Heat Transfer now that I know how his class functions. :: This was one of the first semesters that Dr. Sucosky didn't let his students use notes on the tests. He said that this would help us to get better grades. Then, when we got our first exam back, he told us that we were one of the worst performing classes he had ever seen. Then, when we got our second exam back, his exact words were, ""This is the worst I have seen since I've been teaching Fluid Mechanics."" I think it should be very obvious to him that the reason for our poor performance is that we were not given the same privileges as his previous classes. Hopefully in the future, he will either let his students use their notes again, or at least make their exams easier if they are not allowed to use their notes. :: I learned a lot from this class and understand the material very well. The homework was challenging but also allowed for deeper understanding of the material. :: His homeworks might as well have been a weekly exam that you were getting no help with. :: None. :: I think we should have homework from the book. It would have helped to have some mandatory homework that was easy so I could get some confidence in the subject. I think there should have been more examples in class and some examples with numbers(I understand that this would be hard with this subject) Needed to engage the class more ( Ask us questions more frequently, Show us more videos or images that stimulate our interest and get us to ask questions). He did very well at explaining the material clearly and consistently. I did like writing the notes out in class but sometimes moved too fast and I couldn't follow along (just mindlessly writing down notes). :: Thank you for a great semester. :: Very blunt so there is no confusion as to what you need to be able to do to pass his course. Lectures are very well structured and there is no confusion as to what needs to be done. Class time is always used to its fullest with providing the student information. Not much time for questions but material is provided in a very orderly fashion that doesn't really raise any questions until trying to complete homework, which you can go to his office hours for any clarification. :: His accent is pretty sweet. :: I just don't think that he respects the undergraduate students at all and looks down on us. In his office hours there is hostility, and he gets pissed if you don't understand something: ""this really isn't hard material"". He also doesn't dedicate his office hours to the students that come in, and works on his research while you ask him for help. He gives you a response, and then doesn't care if you are still stuck. He just wants to get you out of there as soon as possible, no patience. Almost every response to a question is answered condescendingly. I have had an A in his class up to this point in the semester, so it's not like I'm a bad student either for him to be treating me this way. A lot of students aren't doing good in the class, and I feel like him being so hostile has prevented people that need help from asking him. If i have a 95 average for the first two exams, and he treats me like an idiot, then I can only image how he treats the students that are failing who understand the material much less than I do."

1954,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3360,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Dr. Sucosky has a very unique style of teaching, compared to the other engineering professors. He was willing to give out handouts that simplified complex problems. :: Dr Sucosky taught this class as if all of his students were experts in Heat Transfer. If a student went to his office hours for consultation, he would say that if you didn't understand you would fail the class. He is a smart person and a good professor, he just seemed to not always assist students who didn't grasp concepts immediately. :: Very very very good. Great professor. :: He's very good at stopping to explain if people have questions. :: Very clear explanations. Kind of disrespectful. The class average on the first exam was about a 55%, and rather than acknowledge that maybe he didn't sufficiently prepare us, he basically said it was sad we didn't know how to do better. I didn't think that was appropriate. He wasn't helpful in answering questions and usually didn't give enough nudge in the right direction to even know where to begin. :: the teacher was very organized he had everything set up for the students to learn the material conceptually and do problems to learn it mathemeatically. :: Good notes. :: Extraordinarily organized.  His notes were outstanding and well organized.  He provided examples in class that defined the process by which we could use to solve the homework problems which were always challenging and stimulating.  He always shows respect for all the students and is readily available to answer questions.  Dr. Sucosky is an excellent instructor and knows the material that his is teaching.  His notes are outstanding and something that I will always keep for reference. :: Dr. Sucosky is an organized professor, providing many notes, examples, and other materials for learning. :: Overall the instructor did a fairly good job with the class since it was his first time teaching the course. There were a couple of mistakes in the handouts and lectures which caused some confusion on one of the tests but otherwise he did a very good job. :: Very effective in teaching, material in class was always clear, the exams followed the examples given in class, very fair grader."
1955,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3360,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes, he was helpful during office hours and giving out handouts. :: He had extensive notes and explained things thoroughly, but he wouldn't always help students when they would come to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He made all his own tests and handouts and you can tell he put a lot of effort into simplifying a tough subject. :: yes, he gave notes and handouts to help me understand the material and told us to remember the things we learned in other courses because they will contribute to our learning. :: Yes, by lecturing effectively. :: Absolutely.  He was available during office hours and at other unscheduled times.  I ask many questions in class to make sure that I understand the material, and he always responds in a positive fashion. :: Yes. Dr. Sucosky covered all the material that we needed to know for exams in great depth. :: Yes but do not have specific examples. :: Yes, he was effective in his teaching, and he always reviewed the material taught in the previous class at the beginning of every class."

1957,Philippe Sucosky,2017 Fall,ME 3360,Question 14,"Additional comments--- N/a. :: Having some form of crib sheet or notes like in previous classes would have been helpful as the material is very difficult. :: Great teacher, kind of rude as a person. :: The University is fortunate to have an instructor of Dr. Sucosky's caliber.  I have 150 undergraduate hours (BSAAE), 30 graduate hours in engineering (MSAE) and 60 graduate hours in business (MBA).  Dr. Sucosky ranks as one of the best four instructors that I have had the privilege of sitting in his lectures.  His teaching skills and subject knowledge are outstanding. :: Overall fairly good job. One suggestion I have is to upload all the notes at the begging of the semester so students can print of the handouts ahead of time instead of having to print them off before class every time. In addition, I wish homework assignment could be done in pencil or ink instead of just ink because if you make a mistake I usually had to completely rewrite the mistake or else the assignment looked messy and unprofessional. Again these are just suggestions on how to make the course better because I believe in continuous improvement. Again I want to reiterate the instructor overall did a pretty good job. :: Great professor, encourages students to work hard and learn. :: Changes could be made to the homeworks. The level of difficulty on the homework was way beyond what was learned in class. They are not good to use for studying purposes and just waste a lot of time in completing them."

I do feel like he could have done a little more to engage the class and stimulate conceptual thinking among the students instead of focusing more on derivations. :: he was passionate about the course and was able to explain the topics in an understandable manner. :: Difficulty of the material of this course ranged dramatically. A lot of the class was derivation of equations which was redundant and unnecessary at time. Usually, 30 minutes of class time could be boiled down to an equation in the book that was boxed in and could easily be referenced.  What would be far more helpful is explaining the physical significance of an equation. This was done sometimes, but I feel like a lot of class time was not well spent. This is possibly why material was consistently rushed out before exams. :: Class notes were relevant and examples were explained well. :: He's a pretty good teacher. He is very knowledgeable about the subject and has personal experience is the area. He accepted questions and would do his best to work through the answer. He likes to stand in front of what he is writing on the board so it can be difficult to see what he's writing sometimes. :: Everythng is good. :: He was so responsive and perfect in all, mentioned above. :: The bonus quizzes were very helpful."

Yes as far as reading the book is an aid. Reciting the very thing the book is saying isn't helpful. Yes, teaching is basically doing exactly that, but effective teaching makes the message easier to digest. This class didn't do that. However, the examples done in class were definitely valuable.

Goes into great detail on the important components of the course and doesn't spend much time going over things already taught in the past. Overall, great instructor. :: Class notes were relevant, examples were helpful. Book problems were more skewed toward being theoretical and less like what appeared on exams. :: Very clear with lectures. :: Class notes were posted online which was great. :: He is very knowledgeable on the subject. There were several occasions through the semester when he would make corrections to the text book because they had derived an equation wrong. Maybe a new book would help. There were a lot of corrections. :: Instructor was cleared with his subjects. He used different practical examples for better understanding of subject. He repeated ask students if they had question and was catering to each question in a polite manner. :: Everything was great. :: CLARITY OF EXPLANATION :  1. Professor used well organised class notes to explain us .  2. He had uploaded all notes on pilot well in advance .so when I started with this course, I had all required material wit me well in advance.  3. He writes each and every steps on the white board to explain which indeed helped me know the procedure well.  4. He gives more time to students to grasp and understand. At the end of the class ,he takes QUIZ. This method is best in two ways. In the first, it keeps us alert always . Secondly it helps us improve our grades. 5. He solves many examples in the class to make us understand.  HANDLING OF QUESTIONS: 1. He tries his best to handle all our doubts i the classroom. If he cannot, he goes back and then the next day he does it without fail.  2. I approached him many times during his work hours for doubts, He cleared all my doubts . 3. He responds immediately to our mails and solves our problems. SIMULATION OF THINKING: 1. He gives quiz problems at the end of the class which keeps us alert and keep thinking on the problems and concepts. This helps to develop thinking process 2. He gives Take home Projects. This helps us to learn the concepts, learn new software (I learnt MATLAB while doing the project) as well as we get acquainted to the paper presentation technique and writing a technical paper RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL: 1. He respects all individuals and treats all students equally. :: Dr. Yang is a very thorough professor when it comes to learning. He kept in class quizes to monitor the performances of students and it proved to be very helpful. The projects which he gave were challenging and it helped to get a better knowledge about the course. :: yes, professor Zifang yang's lecture were well organised, his clarity of explanations and examples are awesome, even he has good thinking ability and respect for individuals and their differences. :: Professor has an exceptionally good teaching style that helped me to learn each topics easily.. :: I think there are a lot of issues with this course and how it's presented. Starting with the materials we are required to purchase, the book is not only ten years old but is completely wrong on most equations. Before we begin a chapter, the instructor has to go through the text with us and correct each mistake. This is made worse by the fact that these corrections are not posted on the website, meaning that if you happened to miss that particular day, or make an improper correction, you are at a disadvantage. The notes that Dr. Yang posts to the website, in my opinion, offer nothing to the course as they are literally just the text from the book copied word-for-word. There might be a few expanded steps on derivations listed, but this not very helpful. The variables used in each chapter may, or may not, mean different things and they are hardly ever introduced clearly. There are a lot of issues with the book and notes, and they need to be addressed. The biggest issue, however, is the way the material is presented. Essentially, it's just copied from the book/notes with no real application presented. The equations are derived, and he tries his best to explain the process used, but when it actually comes to using the equations listed to solve for a physical quantity, there is no help. This makes the homework very difficult as most of the time students are unsure of what is actually being solved for. When it is solved, we are unsure of what the quantity represents. I was challenged by the difficulty in the homework, but only so in finding ways to solve it. Not actually in critical analysis and thought, which is what the engineer is supposed to do. :: He is overall good. :: Bonus quizzes were helpful in maintaining concentration."

He writes each and every steps on the white board to explain which indeed helped me know the procedure well. 4. He solves many examples in the class to make us understand.  5. He shares additional materials, site details and papers with us for our additional information. :: Dr> yang was always available for doubts during his office hours and in class. Also he used to help me via emails. :: Yes he aided my understanding for this subject very well. :: Yes he did aid in my understanding about this subject by challenging us in quizzes by giving various problems on different important topics.. :: In a way, the instructor inspired me to learn most of the difficult concepts on my own, which led me to a more solid understanding. However, no expansion was given on the material presented in the text. I know that equations were derived, but I have no idea which ones are applicable to which state. The homework, which is supposed to help the students understand the applications of the text, only further confused us as we could not really apply what was learned in class, and instead had to look elsewhere for answers. The Joukowski airfoil project that we were required to do was also confusing in what it was trying to teach; was this a project to test the students' ability to code correctly (may be beneficial to post a MATLAB code with key equations left out so that the student may concentrate on concepts learned in class), understand concepts in the text that were not thoroughly explained, see how the joukowski transformation works, or to see who understood aerodynamic principles? The midterm exam was also unfair; Dr. Yang introduced a problem that has never been assigned in homework, barely discussed in class, and made it worth 40% of the overall grade. When asked about this, he said in class that this was how he identified the ""good"" students from the ""bad"" students. I, personally, can understand giving a trick problem on an exam to see how the students will react to it, but I would not make it the most important problem. :: Somewhat agree. :: yes."
1984,Zifeng Yang,2017 Fall,ME 7300,Question 13,Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Not necessary. :: No additional comments. :: No. :: He spent three class periods talking about CFD/his research which caused the discussion of turbulent flows to be cut short. This is frustrating because we have multiple other classes that discuss CFD but no other classes that cover turbulent flows in depth. :: No further comments. :: Overall instructor taught this subject really well. :: 1.Very considerate and student friendly towards students.  2. He sees and considers the hard work of students and helps them to improve the grades by giving bonus quiz's and additional bonus question in main exam 3. He is at the same time very strict and does not tolerate cheating or plagiarism which is very good. Because if a professor let goes plagiarism then this will be injustice towards hard working students 4. He treats all students equally. :: His teaching is good he got good notes for this subject and best knowledge. 9 out of 10. :: He is a good and knowledgeable professor who is having an expert teaching skill sets.. :: He is good instructuer
1985,Zifeng Yang,2017 Fall,ME 7300,Question 14,"Additional comments--- None. :: No additional comments. :: No. :: No additional comments. :: No, additional comments. :: No. :: Dr. Yang is a brilliant researcher, and the presentations he gave us over his work show that he is very knowledgeable in the field of fluid dynamics. I truly believe, however, that he may want to reconsider how this course is taught and what the educational goals are. If I had one recommendation moving forward, it would be to change the textbook used in class. :: Have you considered writing your own advanced fluids book, or trying to find an open-source textbook? (Something like https://openstax.org/). I ask because you seem to have practically done half of the work already, and it is not comforting to start each chapter by correcting major mistakes in the textbook."

He didn't do a great job explaining some things. :: Examples were very helpful and he always wanted us working together and helping each other think through problems. :: I liked how he worked out tons of example problems step by step. :: Mr. Priezjev has a very simple and effective form of lecturing. His slides take all the material in the book and show what is most important and needed. He gives and works lots of examples that help with the homework and in understanding the material. :: I feel like his examples were confusing because he would randomly change variables. It was just really hard to follow some of his examples. :: very clear and good. :: He wasnât super clear when doing examples in class. I felt the class lectures werenât very relevant to the test material. He didnât really make me want to learn considering he would have verbal quizzes that we couldnât use calculators on and he never explained the answers well at all. Class lectures were typically very boring PowerPoint slides when I find its most effective to do example problems instead. :: Would answer any questions. :: He tries to explain at his best, since i was lost in one of the lectures, it was very difficult to c=get along all through the entire semester. his homework are too difficult. :: Nikolai is a great professor. He gives plenty of example problems to explain how dynamics work. I'm sure I would have learned a lot if I paid attention. :: Examples were good. Some of the material was just like looking at a different language some times. Derivations were done so quick that even asking for where certain pieces came from I was left confused after an explanation. Mid lecture quizzes gave some level of extra reinforcement of concepts. :: the lectures were clear and focused. I appreciate the time and effort he put into this class."
1997,Nikolai Priezjev,2017 Fall,ME 2210,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Kind of. As I said before, he did not really do a great job explaining the steps of completing some problems, he just put his work on the board without explaining a lot. :: yes, made new material like circular motion very understandable by using physics and statics explanations. :: yes he is willing to answer questions and re explain concepts. :: Yes, he gave tons of examples and also solutions to help in general understanding and study. I never felt under prepared for exams or homework because all that I needed was taught well. :: I feel like he helped my understanding, but class led to a lot of confusion and I had clean up the mess after class. :: yes learned a  lot about motion and calculations to further my knowledge. :: Not really. :: NA. :: yes. :: He gives plenty of example problems and explains concepts well during lecture. He will stop and give more explanation if it seems the class doesn't understand something. :: I think I have a better understanding of how a lot of things work. Pulleys in Physics I were an area I wasn't quite sure about, but now I think I can solve those problems pretty easily. :: yes, the lectures were well planned and executed"
1998,Nikolai Priezjev,2017 Fall,ME 2210,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- Nikolai's homework assignments were the hardest problems that he could find, but when it came time to take the exam, the problems were extremely easy. He is a very lenient grader, also. :: I like his style of teaching. :: Speaks great good and clear English. Very fair, very smart, and very respectable. Overall an awesome professor in my opinion. :: I found that I was more confused in class that anything. He would go back and forth saying how easy something is and then how difficult it is, so its like he doesn't even know how difficult it is. He tried to teach math off of PowerPoint, but his implementation wasn't good. I just didn't come out learning as much as I was hoping. I felt like I learned more about this subject from physics. :: very good teacher. :: I liked being able to use a crib sheet on exams because in the real world I would have resources available to me anyway and a lot of professors donât get that. I REALLY didnât agree with him keeping exams in a folder and having the class pass it around to dig theirs out. That is a complete invasion of academic privacy because everyone would know how every single person in the class did on the exam. Hand them out instead by calling up students one by one or write the grade on the inside of the exam. :: NA. :: if I had more to say I would have already said it."
1999,Nikolai Priezjev,2017 Fall,ME 2210,Question 14,"Additional comments--- my only complaint is the homeworks were very difficult and time consuming to do correctly. :: Awesome instructor!!. :: keep up good work. :: Good teacher he is nice and I recommend him. :: Awesome Prof. :: I think the class was pretty good. Most people say you don't really need to attend the class, but I think the lectures are good and aid in your understanding of the content."

This class was incredibly informative.  He handled questions very well. :: The instructor does not really look around or accept any questions after asking ""are there any questions"" so on multiple occasions people with their hands raised were not addressed.  The instructor was very good at teaching and the clarity of the material was very well explained. :: Great professor. He admittedly struggles with his accent but its not that bad and makes every attempt he can to make sure we understand him and grasp the material. :: Well taught class. :: great professor, liked how questions from homework and book problems were on exam. also liked that exam questions were straight from the PowerPoints in class. :: He is very educated and have powerful knowledge and his slides are enough to make you understand. :: He explains things well in class, and has well put together lecture notes. He does sometimes review material from previous lectures a bit too much, but he gets through what needs to be covered. :: Dr. Priezjev is a great well rounded professor. :: His examples were fine. :: Very clear lecturer.

We started with the microscopic properties of polymers and worked our way up to macroscopic properties.  He also provided several resources that weren't required to read, but were very informative and helped aid in understanding the core subject. :: Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of the subject.  He uses props to demonstrate the rigidity of polymer chains which is very helpful in understanding the bonds between them and how that effects chain length. :: yes he used a lot of great examples for class. He even brought models. :: Yes. :: very knowledgeable on the subject. :: yes. :: He'll give real life examples about the polymer properties we're talking about, like plastic water filled weights breaking because they weren't elastic enough to deal with the water expanding as it froze or a Plexiglas desk breaking due to a quick application of strong force. :: Yes he did.

Easily one of the best I've had at Wright State. :: He seemed to be taking examples straight from the book and working through them for us. This is an effective method of learning for me, however, it is also a very dry method of learning. It wasn't fun at all. :: Very clear conveyance. Answered questions clearly and effectively. :: His notes were the best I have ever seen from any professor! Very neat handwriting, super easy to follow. He made even the hard problems look easy by explaining every step and involving the class in discussions of how best to solve the problem. :: He kept the whole class stimulated by keeping a brisk pace. And writing down alot of stuff. :: Very well laid out lectures that were heavy on example. Class time was never wasted. Occasionally did not seem to understand a specific question about an example, but eventually got to the answer. Very good at describing a process of thinking that would apply to many different problems. :: Dr. Li is a great teacher who is able to explain Statics very well through key points and specific examples. He is also very kind and showed equality to all students present within the classroom. :: Effective lectures and exams. :: Handled questions well.  Made class extremely boring not motivating students at all.  Would skip through several steps of problems which is ok sometimes.  But others it would be crucial cause he would say just apply the same principles but it is still different and it hurt our learning. :: I enjoyed professor Li's teaching and enjoyed being in his classroom for every class. :: The instructor was very good at presenting material in a consistent, clear an effective manner, showing a process then how to apply the process in a variety of problems. Handled examples and questions very well.  Grading was fair and the class was clearly laid out - no unfair surprises. :: Good on all those, gave great examples. Sometimes didn't understand peoples questions straight away, but wasn't often. :: ineffective at teaching.  Poor examples were given in class and no explanation was given as to why we did anything except solve.  examples rarely related to the difficulty of the homework. :: He didnât do a great job at explaining he would do an example for each section of the chapter but not invite discussion or questions therefor leaving many students confused. There was no excitement on the subject which in return gave no excitement to students to learn the material. He was very respectful in every encounter I had with him but that was very few times."

The problems assigned to us in the book often hadn't been covered in class until about the class before the homework was due. This made it difficult to complete the homework when it was assigned. :: The teacher didn't aid in my understanding of Statics, he created my understanding of statics. :: Yes. The lectures he gave were consistent with the exams and homework. His notes were very helpful when trying to understand the procedure to problem solving. When doing homework I could follow the steps he gave for solving and get the problem right. He also gave solutions to the homework questions. :: Yes, he asked questions about our comprehension often. :: yes; her taught processes for solving problems that can apply to many different types of problems which was very helpful. :: Yes, for example, people in the class would ask questions about the material and he would stop the whole lecture and work out a completely new problem for the sake of the confused individual(s). :: Well I didn't know anything about structural analysis going into the course and now I do, so I say he did a good job. :: Somewhat.  Had to teach myself a lot. :: Yes, very detailed about the subject that was needed and great examples. :: Yes, the Dr. Li provided many examples similar to the exam/homework.  For each topic he would lay out a process to solve the problem, then solve multiple examples balancing instruction with student input.  Examples were clear and clearly written. :: Yes. :: no,  simple examples were given in class.

2052,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4140,Question 11,"Please comment on aspects of the instructor's teaching, such as clarity of explanations and examples, handling of questions, stimulation of thinking, and respect for individuals and their differences.--- Very clear lectures and easy to follow.  She often would do a quick review of the previous lecture and then would write up on the board the objective for that days class. :: in class problems helped with hw and study for the exams. was very clear and explained each step. stopped to explain things if students had questions. :: Worked out examples well, youre a good teacher. one thing to stop doing or work on, is stop trying to trick and nail students with trick questions. We already have enough to think about and try and work through. Deciding whether or not you are trying to yank our feet from under us with stupid trick questions and stuff just frustrates us and makes us angry at you. :: awesome prof. :: Much better than last semester, had much better organization and exam topics were much clearer. :: Handled questions well. Random quizzes to test understanding. :: She was a great professor and I wish I had more of my ME classes with her! She gave plenty of examples, and would always answer people's questions. :: Dr. Gockel is an organized professor, providing many notes, examples, and other materials for learning. :: Very clear professor, encourages participation in class, and answers all questions. :: Dr. Gockel was very good at explaining complex topics in a very understandable way. :: Dr. Gockel was one of the most organized professors I have ever had. She seemed to have each class planned out well beforehand, and had good examples prepared that were relevant to both the course topics and related to the homework problems. She clearly explained all topics, answered students' questions well, and was very responsive to emails."
2053,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4140,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- She absolutely did most apparent in office hours where she would give dedicated one on one attention if you required it to understand a subject. :: yes, explained everything very well, I never left class confused about what I just learned. :: yes. :: Yes, I learned from this course. Learned the basics of how stresses can cause deformations and failures in everyday instances. :: yes, lots of good examples. :: yes. :: Yes, she was easy to talk to after class and didn't make you feel like an idiot. :: Yes. Dr. Gockel covered all of the material we needed to know for exams in great depth. :: Yes, she was very clear on what was expected, and presented the material in the most understandable way possible. :: My answer to this question is similar to the answer above. She provided good examples (most of them real-world problems, not crazy made-up problems) that were very relevant, and usually touched on many aspects of a particular subject. She seemed to be very knowledgeable of the subjects, and communicated that knowledge clearly."
2054,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4140,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- For the love of God, stop waiting until so late in the semester to assign your course project.  We had all the knowledge to work from on the bulk of this project halfway through the semester, and yet you chose to wait until the week before our second exam to assign it. so right before break when communication would be hard and before an exam so that the project was not what we were focused on passing. You did this same stunt last semester in Mech. of Materials. For the sake of your future students, please dont do this again. Made me angry at you this semester too, because you waited too long for something worth 20% of our grade. mentioned that last semester, but clearly that got glossed over. dont make that mistake again. :: good. :: Have her teach more classes please! I have learned so much from her and her method of teaching is awesome! Through her examples, and hands on activities! I also loved she would drop a exam if you had a bad one. :: I do not have any further comments, I am very satisfied with this class and this instructor."
2055,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4140,Question 14,"Additional comments--- The final project feels too open ended, but I suppose that is not always a bad thing. :: nope. :: Very nice professor, with very realistic expectations for her class. :: 10/10, I would take a class with Dr. Gockel again."

She is very easy to understand, and doesnt pull things from ""out of the air."" She does things by the book very well, in which i am referencing the textbook. She answered every question as best as she could, and obviously knows her subject well. :: She walked us through many examples to make sure we knew how to do the problems, she answered any questions we had, and gave us pop quizzes to keep us on our toes. :: She is good at explaining the problems whenever someone is stuck. :: Dr. Gockel is a very nice person, but she really needs to work on not making so many errors in what she writes on the board during lecture.  I understand occasional lapses and arithmetic errors, etc..  But errors in the equations that she wrote on the board were so common that I stopped trusting that what she was writing was correct.  It was lucky that there were other students in the class who were on the ball enough to catch her mistakes, otherwise I would have trusted her and not understood the material.  Also, I learned most of this class from the book.  I basically lost interest in the class after the first exam because the material on the exam was nothing like what we learned in class.  In other words, if it weren't an open book exam and it were say, an open note exam, most people would have probably failed miserably.  That being said, I do realize there is a large amount of information in this class. :: Great. :: Dr. Gockel gave plenty of examples during class that helped show concepts from the book. :: Clear explanations, relevant examples, good at answering questions, and very respectful. I think of her as a role model. :: the teacher was very knowledgeable about the material made sure the student came into the the course understanding the importance of the material like how to look up values from tables to solve problems. :: Need to slow when copying your notes to the board.  Explain the step in a little more detail. :: Joy has the potential to be one of the best engineering professors in this place.  The Good: - Goes over material straight out of the textbook so it's well organized and easy to look over. - Gives extra credit for those who are struggling - Genuinely wants students to learn The Bad: - She does not understand that there is way too much material in each exam Recommendation: - I HIGHLY recommend you have more than 3 exams a semester. After every chapter, give a smaller version of an exam. This way you can cover everything and test us over it all, but it would still be fair. I promise you will see a huge difference in your exam averages. - Maybe consider allowing students to retake 1 (or 2 if you have more than 3 exams) exams a semester - because sometimes you have bad days. - Give us ALL old exams and worked out problems to look over at the beginning of the semester - I personally like to study material ahead of time for class and exams. :: Loved your examples in class and how you took the time to step through each part of a problem, I wish more instructors did this. :: Was very thorough in examples and offered assistance to the class whenever it was needed. :: Dr. Gockel is a wonderful professor who really wants the students to dig into the details and fully understand the concepts. :: She laid out good examples during class and was available for contact through email. The final project was a topic of choice which allowed us to learn more about our topic of choice. :: Examples were well chosen. Writing where the equations, tables, etc were found helped greatly, please continue in future. :: Well laid out class with the material covered, good use of examples in class mixed in with the theory, questions were always answered clearly, posed questions to help motivate us to think deeper on the subject. Never had any problems with the class"
2067,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4150,Question 12,"Did the instructor aid in your understanding of this subject? Â Please give specific examples consistent with your response.--- Yes. :: Yes, she did. She performed numerous examples in class that were very helpful in the calculation parts of the class. I (and maybe some of the class) went into the first exam not knowing what was going to be on it exactly, resulting in a bad grade for me on it. I think she realized this, and on the second exam, she carefully outlined the kinds of problems and what to expect, and i did exponentially better on it because of it. I was very happy she did this, and also dropping an exam grade takes a load of stress and anxiety off me. :: Whenever I had questions about the homework, I went to her office hours, where she answered my questions and explained how to do the problems. :: Yes. :: Somewhat, but I mostly learned from the book.  She went over a lot of stuff that I didn't find useful for the exams and I also found that my understanding of the material she went over was pretty watered down.  This is not usual for me in classes. :: Yes, great in class example. :: Yes. I met with her on a couple occasions to discuss projects or assignments. She was also more than willing to answer questions. :: yes, she taught us from lecture notes to aid in our learning and gave us a project to apply our learning to it. :: Yes her step by step instruction for each problem throughout the semester was great. She also had a guest speaker come in and talk about additive manufacturing. :: Instructor was very helpful, such as timely responses to emails and help on homework assignments. :: very much. Provided good examples in class and challenging homework that really allowed the students to grasp the concepts. :: She answered questions that were off topic. :: Yes, examples in class, see above comment. :: Yes, examples worked in class really helped with understanding of the material for the homeworks and exams"
2068,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4150,Question 13,"Please comment further on any of the items which you were asked about in this evaluation.--- --. :: The exams were way too long.  Too much material was packed in and most of it was serially ordered so that if you couldn't get an answer to something, you would have trouble moving on.  This made it incredibly difficult when you were stuck on some small detail.  I have seen a lot of exams where the teacher will give you a value to use in the next portion, so that they don't have to carry through errors, i.e. part 'a' of a questions wants to know the torque on something, then in part 'b' they say, using 10 Nm for the value of torque, calculate.. blah blah blah.  And 10 Nm wasn't the answer, it was just a generic answer to make sure people could effectively skip a part and not have the whole problem reliant on part 'a.'  I would recommend doing something like that, especially since that makes it easier for you than having to carry through too many errors to give partial credit. :: I wish she would make her tests shorter. Her tests are not hard, but there is consistently too much material. It's stressful to be taking a test and see ten minutes left with half the test incomplete. That makes it hard to focus clearly when you're so worried about time."
2069,Joy Gockel,2017 Fall,ME 4150,Question 14,"Additional comments--- Exam length was consistently an issue. The Exams required longer than the allotted period for many students to complete. :: Thank you Dr. Gockel for being my instructor and always being respectful to me and the rest of the class. With you being one of the few professors that teaches your subject, its always a coin flip whether you get a good professor or not. You have consistently (i took you for Mechanical Design 1 too) been nice and respectful and knowledgeable on your subject. :: Overall my consensus is that she was very nice but I feel like I learned very little in this class, other than from the book and maybe some general concepts. :: Great professor. Exams are pretty long. :: Thanks for the good semester. :: Great class. very interesting to learn. Dr. Gockel did a great job, however sometimes exams can be too long. Overall, very pleased with this class and what I learned. :: I felt prepared for this class b/c I took Dr. G for MD1. :: I guess my only real complaint with the class was it seemed the exams were late in terms of the materials on them. I have gotten used to the format where material on the exam is taught right up until the class period before the exam is given. Introducing material that will be on the following exam makes it a bit confusing. I think this applied more to the first exam were there was a week between the last bit of the material covered and the exam. Other than that it was an enjoyable class with many interesting topics covered."
2070,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- not. :: well. :: not bad. :: Reasonably effective.  Nothing particularly special to note. :: very confusing material, with extremely hard midterm. I had no idea what to expect on the midterm. :: took a little while to understand what he was teaching but after a week or two was able to adjust to the learning capabilities of the class. :: He was a good teacher. He explained thing in a logical and effective manner. :: One of the worst instructors I have ever had. :: Perfect teacher, he has a huge knowledge and experience, that students can learn from."
2071,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he was very open about the course requirements. :: Syllabus is to broad.  This class is set up awful.  He writes equations and draws graphs directly from the book with little information regarding them. Does ZERO examples!  Any attempted at an example is directly from the book!. :: Yes, he did"
2072,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- no, was usually late. :: yes. :: usually 5 minutes late, but went until the time was up. :: Instructor was often a few minutes late, but used full time well. :: was usually 5 minutes late daily. but would use the entire class time. :: he was a couple minutes late for a while but when he came he was able to use the full class period every day. :: Some of the time he was a little late, but the time was used effectively so that was ok. :: He was 5 minutes late almost every class and another 5 minutes starting up equipment. :: Yes, he did"
2073,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- no. :: electric. :: eh. :: Encouraged students to answer questions, participate in teaching. :: would ask questions that he didn't know the answer too and would sit there until someone answered him. Many times we didn't understand what he was asking and wouldn't know how to answer the question, meaning we would sit and waiting a good 10 minutes waiting for him to help us figure out the answer. :: he was always willing to help if anyone needed it and was always trying to help students understand the material. :: He was open to questions and encouraged participation in class. :: None. All interest I had in the subject was lost. This was going to be my favorite class really digging into electrical, optical, and thermo properties. The whole class period, or whats left of it, is used to write direct equations from the book. Come on this is a senior level class we read and already write down these equations on our own time. Show us real world examples. How will we use this? Anyone can come into a class and write equation directly from a book. :: He encourages students to read. look for new information, discuss different points of view."
2074,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- email. :: eh. :: Pretty well. :: very confusing!!!. :: he communicated well outside and inside of the classroom. :: He was good at getting across concepts and was pleasant to talk to. :: Awful communication in the classroom. Asking questions with horrible grammar to the point where everyone interprets what he is trying to ask differently. Examples of this was encountered  in classroom activities, and exams. Had ok out of classroom communication. Answered questions I had via email pretty quickly. :: By using different methods inside and outside the class such as making teams, asking questions individually or for teams tasks,  sending emails, and  meeting in the office hours. In general, the communication is excellent."
2075,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- eh. :: yes. :: eh. :: Yes. :: no, very all over the place. :: yes each class we spent a certain amount of time on a topic. :: Yes, it was. :: NO.  Lectures were pretty fluent do to the fact he just copied straight from the book. The content of the class needs to be improved. :: Yes, they were"

2077,Amir Farajian,2017 Spring,ME 4700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Notes did help with homework but not with exam. :: eh. :: Overall the class was a very confusing class and was not explained very well. Would have liked a review session for exams that actually had example problems as I had no idea what to expect on the exams. :: I enjoyed this class. It was hard but the material was interesting and the teaching was good. :: Farajian is a smart guy and seems like a good person, but is an awful instructor!. :: Thanks a lot Prof. Farajian"

She seemed rude during the first lecture but I soon realized she wasn't being rude, she was just trying to teach effectively. I feel as though I learned a lot from this class and it will help me in the future.

At first she seemed to fly through the in class tutorials to fast but as the semester went on she had better pacing. So over all I felt like she did her job effectively. :: Good instructor, demonstrates the material well, gives us real world material from her experience in industry, automotive, etc. :: Decently effective. :: She was very effective but could sometimes go a little quick in class and be a bit hard to follow. Overall, I enjoyed her as a professor. :: She was fairly effective at teaching. :: She was an ok instructor. There was lots of things due in one week and it was really hard, because we didn't have the time too. The course got decreased 1 credit hour less, so now it was 3 total credit hour.

She made it a point to make sure we were all keeping up and following along with what she was doing as well as walking around and assisting with any problems we were having. :: She would always stop class for brief moments to take questions, make sure everyone was caught up, and she even helped us start difficult design tasks. :: yes. :: Not sure. :: Yes, she would make sure that no student got left behind during solidworks demonstrations. She would undo what she did and would redo it to make sure everyone was caught up. :: She would work with TA's to help out with the errors we encountered. :: Yes the instructor did demonstrate interest in my learning. :: Was very willing to answer questions and assist during class. :: She frequently checked to make sure we understood methods and processes. :: She asked how we were doing with the material, tried to make sure that everyone was caught up and understanding the material. :: She would answer any questions I had and allow me to stay after class to finish work. :: Yes, she had interesting design tasks and projects. :: She would show how to create a part on the projector so everybody will be able to see and then we will just create it. :: Would give open lab time periodically for students to receive help on anything we were doing at that time. :: The instructor showed great interest in students' success, providing feedback and asking questions that engaged students in the topic. :: every design task is very interesting, and that let me interested in her classes. :: Yes when needed if i asked for help i would be added in all problems I ran into. :: would help out if i had questions before class. :: went through examples in class. :: Brought real world examples make sense. :: By seeing my task being done and focusing one my work as a whole. :: I loved creating parts on 3d modeling and she always taught us a lot of different ways to make the part. :: she allowed open lab times at the end of class to allow students to begin working on homework and to assist them if need it be. :: She taught me a lot of stuff that Solidworks can do and also taught how it could be applied in real life engineering. :: She would make time to take questions and answer them before the class. :: yes. :: The teacher was informative and enthusiastic about the information being presented. :: The instructor provided the class with real world representations of engineering work, and even incorporated real world parts for the class to build within homework and class assignments. This in turn aided in my overall interest in the subject matter. :: She didn't, she had no office hours and relied completely on the TAs for any questions or help."
2090,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Spring,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Yes. :: Very effective. :: I never tried to contact her out of class because I had no need to but she was always open to questions in the classroom. :: well, sometimes the instructions on what was due for design task, in the design task was confusing. :: Very well. :: She was easy to talk to in class and was reachable through email outside of class. :: She communicated well in the classroom in relaying information. :: The instructor was very effective in communication both in and out of the classroom. :: Very well.  Communicated on pilot, through email, and the TA's were available for office hours. :: Very well. She kept us up to date with regular emails. :: communicated well both in and out. :: very effectivley. :: She communicated pretty well in class however emailing her was not always a good option as it would take a while to get a reply. Yet, her TA's could always email back pretty quickly. :: She was responsive to her email. She was a little unclear of what she expected at times. :: The instructor and the TA's took over until the respond back to the emails.It takes them about a week or so for them respond back, which the task was already deu. :: Always assured that the students had all the necessary tools to complete the work required. :: All emails and information given in lecture were extremely clear and effective(e.g, instructions for using a new feature or creation of a part were clear and easily followed). However, the Design Task instructions, posted as homework on the class pilot webpage, were at times vague, confusing, missing important information, and directly contradictory (e.g, ""submit these files"" and ""submit only that file""). :: yes. :: In class she explains different techniques and tools very effectively and answers all questions that are asked. :: regular emails about updates and reminders. :: very well. emailed when needed. :: Could have been better, she is pretty quick, but the goes back and reviews. :: She communicated very well inside class, but outside of class it took a while for her to email me back. :: He didn't really communicate with us out side of class but she was always communicating with us during the class. :: she communicated very well in this class entirely. :: She answered my questions in and out of the class. :: She was approachable and understanding. :: effectively. :: Communication both in and out of the classroom was effective. :: The instructor was attentive, and thoroughly listened whenever students needed assistance. She also provided help hours outside of class time to help students get a better understanding of the work. :: communication was poor at best"
2091,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Spring,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes very well. :: yes. :: Sure was. :: Yes, when there was a lecture she would go over the power point and then post the power point of pilot. :: Yes.  especially the way the design tasks reinforced the topics discussed in class was very good. :: Yes the course content and lectures were most certainly well organized. :: Yes, very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well organized. :: Yes. :: The course and the lectures were very organized. :: Yes, Mirmasoudi was always well prepared and had materials at bay for any changes of direction that came up. :: The course content was well designed, with the exception of occasionally contradictory instructions on the Design Tasks. Lectures were well structured and informative, lecture notes, although slightly disorganized, helped to reinforce the class material. :: yes. :: Yes all the information taught in class was uploaded to be viewed later if needed. :: i give it a 70% organized. :: yes. :: yes, the easiest class to keep up with. :: Yes. :: Yes it was. :: yes, this class was very well structured. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Course content and lectures followed a strict plan and were well organized. :: Yes. :: average"
2092,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Spring,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, we could email her with any questions we had and she would respond promptly. :: I do not know, I never tried to go to them. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, when you needed help during class either a TA or she would be walking around to help us. The TA's also had office hours which helped. :: While she was not often available, it is understandable in her role as an adjunct professor. :: Yes the instructor was reasonably available and responsive to my needs during office hours and online. :: Yes. Very accessible through email and the TA's had regular office hours. :: Yes. :: yes, she did not have office hours but the TA's did and were available.  She answered questions in class and through email. :: Yes. :: As stated prior, she was difficult to contact online but her TA's were able to answer questions. :: Yes, she was responsive. :: The instructor was available during the office hours. :: Yes. :: The instructor was available and responded to communication within a timely window. :: yes. :: The Instructor did not but the TA were always available for help when i emailed them or went to the help room. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, absolutely. :: Yes. :: She didn't have any office hours but the TA's had office hours and i always went to those. :: yes, I had to make appointments with her a few times, all of which she was able to make. :: The office hour was increased to 2 hours per week which helped me a lot. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor was available and accommodating to office hour needs. :: Yes. :: no, no office hours available other than meeting with the TAs"
2093,Sara Mirmasoudi,2017 Spring,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- What was expected on each assignment was not very clear and ended up missing points for it. Could be more organized. :: One of the best instructors I've had on campus so far. Too bad she's not a professor so that she can teach more courses. :: Some of the instructions on things were very vague, I believe if things like ""do not submit this"" or an list of everything needed was provided, the class would have went even smoother. That is my only complaint because I feel I was still able to learn all of the material that I was suppose to. :: Nope. :: She made sure that everyone was learning in the class and understood what she was teaching. She never let a student fall behind. :: No. :: No I do not have any additional comments to give. :: I think the class needed more TAs since she frequently had to stop lecturing because she had to help out with people who got behind. :: no. :: I really enjoyed this class and the professor this semester. Most of the issues I explained are actually not too big of a deal in this class and I was being a bit nit picky since there wasn't too much I would say to improve. :: Sara was a good teacher for this engineering course. :: The class was easy, but we were always crunched on time. This class is to big to be only three credit hour class. :: Instructor Mirmasoudi has an extreme understanding of Solidworks and was always able to assist or fix problems that students came across. :: she is very good teacher on classes. same as her I am also using second language life in the US. she English is very good and I can totally understand her. I hope she can keep going she style. :: No. :: No. :: I think she was a very nice teacher and I wish I could be able to T.A. for her. :: Her explanation was good but fast and I could not keep up. I know it is because the class got shorter than before and I think the class time should be longer. Some people already had experience using solidworks so it is understandable that class is boring and waste of time but someone like me who never had this kind of class could struggle. I think the class time should be longer but with no attendance required so people who don't get solidworks can learn a lot and people who already know solidworks don't have to waste time. :: No. :: focus more on clarifying the instructions on the instruction worksheet on the design tasks."
2094,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson is very good with the subject covered in this course. However, I struggled greatly with what he taught. Whatever I got from this course was mostly gained by my studies outside of the classroom. :: Poor. :: Digresses constantly. Does not elaborate very well. :: not very effective. :: Class was not effective. :: He flat out does not teach. He will ramble for most of the class and expect you to somehow know what to do for homework and exams. :: horrible had to learn most of the material on my own examples in class were nothing like the homework based on difficulty and how they were worded. :: He is a fairly average professor from a teaching standpoint. He is an engaging person in a small group conversation. :: Dr. Jackson is an okay lecturer. :: He is a nice individual who likes to see his students succeed and is willing to help. But unfortunately the course itself was not very well taught and he isn't very easy to understand and follow. :: Good. :: ok. :: he is nice and funny, and he care alot about the students. :: Good. :: Good material. :: Not very. Extremely unorganized and dysfunctional class. Extremely boring with no really engaging topics or assignments. Often in class students, myself included, were clueless as to what was going on or being covered in lecture. The book was terrible, full of equations with no clear explanation as to where they came from or how they are used. The beginning of class often never provided an outline to what would be covered during lecture, so the first 15-20 minutes were spent trying to find where in the notes he was going. The notes he posted online from lecture were not posted till after class and were usually just like the book, full of equations with no real explanation on how to use them. Toward the end of the semester the frustration among the students was pretty clear. Students, myself included, stopped showing up to class because they felt that it was a waste of time to sit in class listening for an hour and a half and constantly be confused or lost as to what was going on. When asked questions, his answers were usually very vague and confusing and often ended with a rant talking about ""well in real life you get real data, which never works out ideally so you can't use this data, or this equation..etc"". Cant wait to be done with this class. :: a. :: not bad. :: Not very effective. :: While Dr. Jackson is very nice and polite, he does not not seem very helpful. There was a minimum number of functional examples of coursework to prepare for exams. Functional examples would pertain to examples that show step by step how to work problems; most examples were questions with answers, and no explanation of how the answer was derived. :: 0. :: Dr. Jackson is very intelligent but tends to be a bit monotone. This sometimes distracts some of the students as it is already a semi-uninteresting course. In my personal opinion I think Dr. Jackson would make a great senior design instructor. He has real world experience and asks the tough questions. :: Very effective instructor. Extremely knowledgeable. :: good. :: Seemed to be prepared to have class. Just too much material to learn in one class. :: great, very knowledgeable. :: Not as effective as I would have hoped. Took a couple of lectures for his microphone to be repaired (?). Though the content of his lectures were somewhat helpful, the Excel programs as worked problems were difficult to analyze. It was also hard to get anything out of the solved solution manual questions he used as examples periodically. His handwritten solutions were much more thorough, but difficult to read. :: there was none. :: Got stuff done on schedule and had time to help us with problems we were all having troubles with. :: Nice guy, obviously intelligent but I had a very hard time learning from him.  Part of the problem was the class setup: I have not had a single scale-up style class that I thought didn't waste a significant amount of time, and this one was no exception.  further, the class size was to large for such a complicated subject, and the TA's appeared to mostly exist to grade homework.  Finally, his use of in-class tech was a constant distraction, from the mic which kept going out mid class to versions of software that wouldn't do what wanted.  I think that the most effective teaching tool he used was solving problems step by step on the overhead projectors (even though his handwriting is atrocious.)   Of all the courses I have taken that had a prerequisite, this is THE ONE that should have had statistics as a prereq!. :: Overall fairly effective. :: Not very well"
2095,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: The material is on the syllabus. But he does not teach is. :: For the most part, though it was a bit hard to gain an insight into what may be on the tests and we had a wide range of possible topics. Most likely this is a result of the class attempting to force too many topics into a semester. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: somewhat yes. :: I'm not really sure because the students expectations were not clearly outlined. The class was so disorganized and dysfunctional that it was almost impossible to follow along with lecture notes. :: a. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I am not able to make that determination as there was no feedback/reason for lost points on any wrong answers. :: Yes. :: Yes to a ""T"". :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: his TAs did. :: yes. :: meh. :: Yes he evaluated work according to syllabus. :: No I don't think that"
2096,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The class always started on time and always lasted the entire period. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. But the quality of the teaching is atrocious. :: Yes. without exception. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes indeed. :: Yes. On time and lasted all 80 minutes. :: a. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. We rarely got out early. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Class started and ended on time. :: yes. :: Always. :: yes unfortunately. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes
2097,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He tried to relate this to real world issues. :: He did not. :: real world examples. :: yes. :: He does not care. He is unqualified to teach. :: he was always willing to engage in one on one conversations about his experiences and how the topics may relate to such work. :: The main complaint I have with this course is that the lectures were very dry and boring. I struggled to see how a lot of this content would be applied to real world scenarios. :: examples in class. :: he would always be willing to help if you didnt understand something. :: he gave us alot of reviews. :: Not effectively. :: a. :: not much. :: He helps when you ask him for help, but he's not always the most helpful when he attempts to help. :: He tried to help the class understand the material. The book was more of a reference manual for theory than a teaching aid. :: Yes he asked questions all the time. :: Always answered questions. Came in during non class time for extra help. :: he did problems relative to my field. :: He tried to help with examples, but the answers given were hard to understand. :: yes. :: yes. :: New my name and took a special interest in me. Answered all the questions I asked. :: Nothing like that"
2098,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- In the class room, it was hard to understand the material as he explained it. He often did a better job during his office hours. :: Neutral. :: decently. :: pretty well. :: good. :: In the classroom it's as if I was taking ceramics. Nothing that came out of his mouth was conducive to the class. :: He was average when communicating. on a side note the microphone problem in the class room needs to be permanently resolved if you expect to continue having such large class sizes in a spread out room. :: Well. :: pretty effective. :: very good. :: he is nice. :: available for any question. :: Occasionally sent out emails with assigned homework problems or clarification over something from the lecture. :: on that he is really good. :: well, via email and pilot for course material and lecture updates. :: He communicates averagely. He struggles to keep the class interested. Very monotone. :: Fine. :: Yes he was always available for consultation. :: Very effectively. :: yes. :: His mic would cut out/ lose battery a lot during classes. He also had a tough time hearing people. :: Went very fast through powerpoints and example problems so it was hard to take notes and pay attention. The problem with using excel is that we see the final answer but have no idea what the equation used to find that answer, also he would go fast though them so they ended up being useless because I couldn't follow along with him going so fast. :: not well. i was always lost. :: through email out of class and in class just announced. :: not well-  I sometimes think he had an assumption of content on my part that was definitely above my current level. :: He communicated effectively. :: Not very well"
2099,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No, we skipped around in the book often which lead to a lot of confusion. The book that was used for the course was also poorly written. Overall, the layout for this course was poorly organized which made keeping track of information difficult. :: No. :: not at all. :: some of the time. :: No, I feel really loss in class content and lectures. The note from pilot is not helpful at all. The note in class should be posted while in class so student can follow along. :: Absolutely not. This professor should the top priority to consider for budget cuts. :: No. this is the only area that I must say the professor fell short. The class was disorganized and it has lead to consistent confusion on the part of many students I have spoken to. :: For the most part. :: at times they felt like we were not using class time well but mostly yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes but it can be better. :: Absolutely not. :: a. :: yes. :: tes. :: Not really. :: No. Course content was poorly organized and hard to follow. Lectures were theory with few complete literal examples. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: I guess they were well organized.

2101,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- We can barely hear you in the class.  Please explain the concepts before giving examples. :: does not teach subject very well and course textbook is absolutely terrible and does not contribute to learning the material at all. :: no. :: The book was really bad and it not helpful. :: Fire this incompetent professor he is unable to teach. :: Good man. The class needs to be organized better. :: overall good class, Dr. Jackson is a good professor. :: no. :: Maybe try and get a new professor to teach this class, the material is already boring enough. I believe Dr. Jackson has a lot of knowledge but its just time to get someone new with a more modernized game plan on how to teach this class effectively. :: a. :: no. :: No. :: Seems class structure needs to be revised to allow for higher success of students. Labs were a struggle to complete at times do to misinformation in the professor composed lab manual. :: Enjoyed the teacher's time and effort. Not my favorite class.

2102,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor for the labs was difficult to learn from. :: Poor. :: not prepared for labs. :: not very effective. :: Lab is not well organize and not explain detail which makes the student really confuse. :: He is just as terrible in lab as in class. In fact, he was worse, which was something that I did not think was possible. He will blow through the lab and expect you to be able to miraculously keep up. :: Dr. Jackson was over worked with the size of his class, which affected his ability to help students. The ta, Zach, was not only unhelpful but condescending and rude. He provided no benefit to the labs. :: Often times the labs were disorganized and students were left confused. There were not enough TA's in the class either so when groups had questions, they would often have to wait 10-20 minutes to receive an answer. Overall, this lab experience was frustrating. :: Jackson was not able to get to all the students during the lab period. He had too many students and often couldn't get to all of us. When he was able to get to us, he understood the material and could answer our questions. :: The required lab for this course was not only a waste of time but irrelevant to the course itself. :: Good. :: ok. :: he is nice and funny. :: good. :: Good material. :: Not very effective. Not much teacher to student level input on how to guide your way through some of these computer programs. Much of learning to use Lab View was self taught, although he did provide a few basic walk through tutorials on certain lessons. :: a. :: trying to be focus in the lab but there is some difficulties to be all the class understanding the new program LabVIEW. :: labs weren't well organized, made reports/graded lab material very difficult to answer. :: More effective in the lab than he is in the lecture. :: not good. :: Not bad. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Very effective. :: great teacher. :: I personally didn't learn much from the labs. All I learned is how boring and confusing LabVIEW is. :: very scatterbrained, labs were all over the place. :: was able to explain labs somewhat well. :: meh. :: He was very effective. :: Not very well"
2103,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: gave us guidelines for labs but seemed to pick a part things that were not specified in the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. He would inconsistently grade the labs. He was more unpredictable than a bipolar chameleon. :: Dr. Jackson was very clear in how he wanted his work submitted. The labs were not as defined and there was very little room for error. When asking the ta about missed points, he was rude and refused to give valid reasons. :: Yes. :: Yes. He laid it out clearly. His TA graded too hard though.

2104,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Class was always started on time and more often than not went over on its allotted time. :: Yes. :: no, class time was not utilized properly. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. He would barely describe the lab within the first five minutes of the start of lab and then you were on your own without a paddle. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, and many times the lab went far longer than the intended lab period. This was not okay because some people had class after the lab period but certain experiments couldn't be reran on a different day because of the nature of the data acquisition (DAQ) component. Twice, our group had to switch out DAQ components because they weren't working properly (THEY'RE BRAND NEW!!). In another lab, Dr. Jackson came by our group to answer questions along with one of the LAb TA's and said the setup was correct and that everything was entered properly and at the end of the lab our data turned out to be completely wrong. This couldn't be fixed because we couldn't just run the lab over, the whole setup had to be redone. This kind of miscommunication and failed equipment caused groups to run over lab time multiple times. :: a. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: meh. :: Yes he did. :: Sometimes"
2105,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- A little. :: not well. :: He somehow killed it even more than the math department did. :: Dr. Jackson would reach out to students who were falling behind to make sure they could get caught up. :: I wish that he would have done a better job with this. Often times I didn't know how I might apply the information to real systems. :: Yes. :: mostly. :: he was always wiling to help. :: yes. :: Not sure. Didn't seem interested himself sometimes. :: I don't feel any thing would interset my learning. :: He tries to help whenever it is needed. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Stayed after class to assist. :: he did problems related to my field. :: Would try to answer questions during labs. :: very knowledgeable. :: somewhat. :: meh. :: Answered all my questions. Provided positive feedback. :: Nothing

He sent emails out of class to reiterate what he said in class. :: the labs were poorly organized and took much longer than the allocated time. :: very good. :: he tried to make all of us understanding the materials. :: Decently. :: some as the lecture class. :: Not too great. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Very. :: he was free at many times outside of class. :: I never contacted him. :: said what the labs were in class before the day of lab and had a schedule with each weeks lab. :: meh. :: He communicated effectively. :: Not very well
2107,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The labs were very poorly organized. Often times, we would be able to start the labs until there was only about 45 min left of the lab time due to the instructor trying to cover how to do the lab. There were insufficient lab assistants so questions wouldn't get answered in a timely manner during the lab. Several labs were so disorganized that it took most of the class period to figure out how to properly due the lab to get the desired data. :: Yes. :: not at all. :: yes. :: Oh absolutely not. This has been, by far, the most haphazard, poorly put together class I have been a part of. :: There were times when the lecture was hard to follow. This would be after a difficult lab, when we were about to start new material. :: Not particularly. :: No. The labs were often disorganized and the time was not used well. There were not enough TAs for the number of students. So if we got stuck, we were often waiting for over 15 minutes waiting for a TA to get to us. :: not really. :: no labs were confusing and most people stayed and hour after lab every week to finish gathering data. :: yes. :: Absolutely not. Disorganization and dysfunction should be the class title. :: some how yes but not good enough. :: No. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Yes. :: Sort of he could have organized them better and released information at an earlier time period. :: No, some labs were extremely jumbled and confusing to the point that a lot of the content was lost. For example, the last lab, which was a formal report lab, was so hard and confusing that 90% of the class had to stay way late after class to finish. Even then, my group missed the entire procedure and point of the lab. I ended up just being a race to try to get as many points as possible. :: labs very very confusing, many times we would wait 30 minutes to ask a simple question, there needs to be more TAs that can help. Also many times the lab TA would tell us the wrong information and then would have to get Dr. Jackson to fix what the TA messed up. :: not really. :: not always because its a big class and hard to get everyone on board with the same lab setup. :: meh. :: Yes they were well organized. :: Not very well"

Very easy to go to his office and see him. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Fairly. :: yes. :: Yes. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes, was always in his office to help when a question came up. :: yes. :: meh. :: Yes. :: Sometimes"
2109,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 3600L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: labs need revamped and students need taught how to use the software he wants us to use. Every lab used the same software but after the first lab we were expected to know how to program in this software based off of the directions given to us (which are poorly given). :: no. :: He sucks. Fire him. He's only causing more budget problems for Wright State by being kept. :: No. :: While Dr. Jackson tried his best to make the labs go smoothly, they never did. Only having one TA for a lab with over 50 people was a bad decision. The head TA, Zach was not helpful and often times got frustrated because he could not figure out what was not working. On top of not having an answer he graded our work very harshly. I felt this was unreasonable as neither him not Dr. Jackson had an answer for our labs when we were stuck. :: the labs in my opinion need to be revised. :: no. :: This class was a complete waste of time because I feel that I didn't effectively learn everything that was meant to be taught in this lab along with the class. This feeling is mutual between many students in this lab and class. A fresh new start with a new professor may be the best option. :: no. :: No. :: All answers are the same as the lecture. :: needs to release information on solutions after assignments have been completed not wait for exam and give us the solution. :: labs were very confusing and hard to figure out the end result. the lab manual was  many times hard to understand to determine what graphs needed to be plotted for the final report. Would have also been nice to remind us to take screen shots of lab results since the Texas instrument was required for the results to review the lab results. :: No additional comments. :: No"
2110,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- very good. :: not very effective. :: He was helpful to my earning of the course and material. :: He is a very knowledgable professor and knows a lot about how the labs go and what material we need to know. :: Good. :: Very effective. The professor aims to let the students understand everything in this lab. I have learned a lot from this course. :: great. :: Instructor did excellent job explaining expectations to students and made sure all students understood given lab and how to achieve accurate results in a safe environment. :: He effectively introduced labs, answered questions on material, and gave other guidance when necessary. :: Very effective. Knowledgeable and kind. :: Yes. :: so effective. :: Dr. Jackson knows the material well however often times has a hard time translating it into words for other to understand. Often times if asked a question regarding a required calculation or about the lab he wouldn't know 100%. I appreciate his willingness to sit down with our group and let us answer questions and work through problems. The lab manuals went into very high level detail or background info that never seemed to come out in the lab itself."
2111,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: for the most part. :: Yes, the instructor evaluate me on the expectations that were listed in the syllabus. :: I would say that he graded us fairly based on the knowledge that we had and the lab reports we wrote. :: yes. :: Yes. Fair and decent. :: Yes, expectations in course syllabus were clearly defined and followed. :: Yes. :: Yes, could have explained grading report expectations in more detail. Not sure it was him, more his TA. :: Yes. :: It seems so however besides the paper Dr. Jackson graded the rest have been very slow with little comments or feedback. Also the general format was very vague."
2112,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes.  And it was a lab so class time was used as necessary. :: Yes he always started class on time and used as much of the time as he needed to explain the labs. :: yes. :: Yes. Always start on time and spend the class time very well. :: Yes, instructor used all resources accordingly. :: Yes. :: Yes, this class didn't meet very often (by design). :: Yes. :: Always started on time but the nature of the class never kept us the full time. Often we would meet and have to comeback to do experiments due to time constraints with group members or experiments."
2113,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- very good. :: no he very confusing and hard to understand when he was explaining the labs. :: Yes. :: He was always available for questions and had useful input for the students. :: yes. :: Very well. :: Gave real world examples of why this is used and the equipment used to conduct an experiment aided in learning. Hands-on approach. :: Meetings with individual groups to clarify things on the most complex lab report. :: He would always be willing to talk about the work and field questions. :: Yes. :: Yes he sat down with every group to ensure everyone was caught up.
2114,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: not very good  very bad at explaining stuff. :: Pretty good, was a little slow responding to emails with questions relating to reports that were due. :: He is very easy to work with and always available for questions in and out of the classroom. :: good. :: Very effective. :: Very effective with use of pilot feedback and email. :: Well; he was responsive to emails and questions in person. :: Very well. :: Yes. :: Sometimes slow to responding to emails but always gave an answer that would clarify or help our group"
2115,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: for the most part. :: For the most part, yes.  Sometimes lab manuals were a little confusing and required explanation. :: The lab manuals were sometimes hard to read and decipher what the manual wanted us to do. :: fine. :: Yes. :: Yes, explained well. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. :: Sometimes they did not seem well prepared or not enough enough chance to see what was happening during experiment"
2116,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: for the most part he was. :: Yes. :: The instructor was always available in and out of the classroom to help with questions or advice. He responded promptly to emails as well. :: fine. :: Yes. :: Yes, always available if needed. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No. :: yes"
2117,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- post grades on pilot and not only have 10% of the grade up at the end of the semester can get better on lab reports if get no feed back before the next lab is due. :: No. :: I really liked the format where we talked to you about our lab reports in your office. I feel like we got a lot more out of that than just seeing a grade on pilot. It is a good way to pass along information in my opinion. :: no. :: I enjoy his thorough work with students, and willingness to address any question or concern about the class. He would also talk about the professional world and real applications of the subject material. :: No. :: Dr. Jackson is a very intelligent individual who knows a lot about materials. With that being said he often expects all students in this class to have a high understanding of material science when most do not. This causes for contusion and not correct results."
2118,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- effective. :: Dr. Jackson gives great examples on how the material is used in industry, but he is difficult to follow through the lectures. :: Knew the topics and was able to give personal insight that helped understand the topics. :: good. :: good but class and lab were very unorganized"
2119,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, followed the syllabus exactly. :: eh. :: haven't had any grades yet so not sure."
2120,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes was always on time and used the full class other then days where we were in the lab and could only test one sample at a time. :: eh. :: yes, during lab time, it was learn the new machine then sit around and play on our phones for the rest of class. Waste of time."
2121,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He frequently related what he was teaching back to real life examples. :: Was always stopping and making sure we knew what was going on and being covered. :: he was always wiling to help
2122,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- when it came to practical and experimental learning he was very competent at instructing, but when it came to lectures and communicating the conceptual ideas he was hard to follow. :: Great, was always available and wild always respond to emails. :: good. :: well. although the powerpoints for lecture were random."
2123,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- This course was disorganized. :: Yes. :: eh. :: the lab was very scattered and confusing on the procedures.
2124,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes he was very available and responded quickly to questions and concerns. :: Yes, was always there and always responds to emails. :: yep. :: yes, always in his office when a question came up"
2125,Allen Jackson,2017 Spring,ME 4750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great teacher and knows his topics. :: cool class. :: wish to have had a lab manual for the lab portion. felt like entire class was unorganized."
2126,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He is okay. :: Well being that this was his first time teaching Matlab it is understandable the he started poorly. He improved lots throughout the semester and if the whole class was taught like it was towards the end, I feel I would have learned a lot more. I feel that it is unfair of how his ineffectiveness at the beginning  of the semester hurt so many grades. Dr. B did teach very well once we started GUI's though and if he keeps that up he will be very effective as an instructor for this course. :: pretty effective. :: He did a good job of teaching the class. He made it enjoyable even though I am not very good with computers. :: 10/10 I loved this class. craig did a great job teaching it. :: Professor Baudendistel is a great instructor and his effectiveness was overall presented well. :: For teaching the class for the first time, I'd say Craig was an effective instructor. I'm certainly nowhere near the best programmer in the class, but I can say that I have learned a fair amount of programming from this class. :: Dr.B was a effective professor but in the beginning of the course he was very fast in his teachings. :: He needed to slow down the class cause he thought we know Matlab. :: Dr. B was very effective as an instructor.  He was able to easily convey information that I could understand and follow. :: Dr. B is a very effective instructor. There were a couple times where his lecture slides did not have the correct information on them. :: very effective. :: He was decent, however, he often times did not explain fully how to solve a certain type of problem. He would simply show you a question on the board, have you try to solve it, then give you the answer with little or no explanation and then go on to the next question. :: Dr. Baudendistel was an enthusiastic and effective instructor, the class was fast paced and hard to follow at times, but he was willing to work with anyone unable to keep up. :: Instructor was very effective. Made a difficult class rather enjoyable. :: Effective. I would have preferred that he worked through more code in class before he gave us things to work on. I felt like I had no idea what was going on a lot of the time. I really enjoyed how the TAs ran the review sessions because they really worked through problems in a way that was easy to understand. I think Dr. B was far too ambitious on the amount of material that he wanted to cover. I think it is somewhat unreasonable to expect students to do homework during finals week, especially when a large project is due. :: he did a good job teaching the class. :: The instructor was extremely effective at engaging the class and conveying lecture information. :: The instructor was very good at his teaching except for a few things.  The initial portion of the class was expected just slightly higher amount of knowledge from egr 1010.  Egr 1010 did have the matlab content but it was not the main aspect of the class and didn't affect the grade hardly at all.  Resulting from this, most students didn't take matlab as a priority hence not preparing them for ME 1020.  Not always prepped for exams but besides these two points instructor did well conveying material and helping students. :: Bit of a rocky start, but the pacing got much better.  Class seemed to be rushed a bit through out the semester, more and different examples would be helpful, especially for reference for the homework.  Pace towards the end of the semester was much better.  Maybe try and integrate the GUI's and project a little earlier.  ODE section felt very rushed.  Overall, nice first semester at 1020.  It will only get better. :: Very good even though it was his first time teaching the course. :: He is a very good instructor. I would recommend him to anyone. :: For having no prior teaching experience with Matlab, Dr. B did an excellent job. He was well-organized and understood the material. :: he really tried his hardest so we could under stand the tough material. :: One of the best instructors I've ever had. When nearly the entire class failed his first exam, he offered a make-up and changed his tactics. Most other instructors I know would be too self-centered to admit that their teaching or evaluation methods were flawed. :: He was very helpful and I learned a lot. The start of the class was rough due to it being his first time but he worked with the class to know how best to teach the class. :: Great. :: Dr. B is a very effective professor.  He has an amazing ability to adapt to any problem and give assistance. :: 4/5 stars. Very nice guy, hes a good professor, but he would tend to make exams longer and harder than they need to be. He would set us up for failure many times in class, which I do not always agree with. :: He was a great instructor for this course and was very informative. You can tell that he loved what he taught. :: poor. :: Craig knows his stuff very well  and is always enthusiastic. Very fun to learn from. :: The beginning was rough since I had no idea how to code in matlab and no experience with syntax but around halfway through I was able to understand the lessons and learn a lot. It helped a lot when he started the lesson by dragging us through either an example code or the first code in a series of codes."
2127,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: I have no opinion on this because once I feel I was taught better my grades reflected it, but at the beginning of the semester I learned nothing, was plain confused the whole time, and spent countless hours trying to figure it out. :: yes. :: Yes he did!. :: yes. :: He based the work based on the course syllabus. However there were times where the work was large and the time was not available. :: Yes. :: Dr.B did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: NO! he kept pushing us even though we didn't understand the section. HE never slowed down t let us learn the material. :: Yes. :: The grades received for different assignments were based on the expectations in the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes, he evaluated fairly and how I expected. :: Dr. Baudendistel would evaluate work based off of the syllabus and would deviate from it only when he had already cleared it with the class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: All coursework was graded clearly, in accordance with the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, very adaptable to student's needs as well. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. and how hard we worked. :: Yes. :: the syllabus was accurate throughout the year. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes, the syllabus made it very clear what the expectations for this class were and the grade breakdown. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes, the syllabus detailed how the work would be graded and that outline was followed throughout the semester."
2128,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did!. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, honestly I think this should have been an 80 minute class rather than 55 minutes because we used every bit of class we time we had, and could've used more. :: Dr.B started class on time and used the full class period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He usually started class on time. Sometimes he got carried away and did not realize that the class time was over and would continue teaching. Someone would have to notify him that the class time was over. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time. :: The class always started on time and would run the entire time block. :: yes. :: Yes. :: always. :: The instructor was timely and punctial;classes regularly began and finished on time. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Class always started on time and always went the full length. :: yes. :: he used the full class time to the best of his capabilities, and even spent extra time if we needed it. :: Yes. I recommend scheduling this class for longer periods in the future. 55 minutes was too short, I would be okay with 80 minute periods 3 days per week. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: class was always started on time. :: Yes, sometimes we would accidentally go over time, since it is only a 55 minute class. :: Yes, he started class on time everyday, and used the entire class time period. :: the class time was spent inefficient but he was on time and was teaching whole period. :: Yes. :: Yes. Though I would have liked more time to look over the material before class. We only have an hour so if we could look over material before hand it might help a bit."
2129,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He is okay. :: He demonstrated this by adapting the class to how it should have actually been from the start. :: interesting projects and demonstrations. :: He was always open for questions and had extensive office hours. :: he offered office hours, gladly answered any questions asked in class and reviewed anything the students had trouble understanding. :: Yes, he always asked for questions from the students and had activities during class. :: Craig pushed us to apply prior knowledge to each task we learned throughout the semester, and tried to give examples of how you could apply these skills to the outside world. :: Dr.B showed a lot of interest in my learning. :: He didn't!. :: Dr. B would occasionally work with the other TA's to help out the students with the errors in their code. :: He made sure to teach us what companies would like to see people to have. Also he gave us real world applications for the different topics. :: yes. :: He made plenty of office hours which I found to be of great help. :: Dr. Baudendistel wanted to make sure that all the students in the class were able to understand the topics explained in class. :: Instructor was readily available for questions and gave lots of help when asked. :: Dr B was extremely enthusiastic and I really appreciated his interest in the field and he always made sure to relate what we were learning to the field. :: he answered all questions we had and was available in office hours for any further explanation. :: The instructor was extremely engaged in students' learning, providing feedback, asking questions that prompted critical thinking, and was responsive to the pace of the class. :: yes. :: Showing and using practical examples, almost all applied examples. :: Yes. :: He was very passionate about what he was teaching us. He gave lots of help when needed. :: Dr. B always addressed any questions sincerely and answered them in a comprehensible manner. :: he tried the best he could to help each and every student given the size of the entire class. :: Hard to explain. Dr. B. never insulted your intelligence. If you had an issue, he would explain it until you understood it, within the time constraints of the class period. :: He is helpful and answer emails to point us in the right direction. :: He was always excited to teach and willing to help if anyone had trouble understanding. :: real world examples were always provided to prove the importance of the class. :: He would show us cool things you can do with Matlab, and will show you how to do something in Matlab while being polite. :: He was always very energetic during class making even the most boring material interesting, and he was almost always available after class to help on a problem with the programing. :: did not interest me. :: He made everything as interesting as it could be. He made coding less of a chore. :: seeing how we can create programs to represent real world problems helped a lot."
2130,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Effectively. :: He communicated amazingly. There were times when I would email him at 11:30pm and he would respond at 11:31 pm. :: very effectively. :: Very well. :: very well. :: He communicated well. :: Craig is very good about communicating what we need to know inside and outside of class. :: Dr.B effectively communicated in and out of the classroom allowing me to email him whenever I had a problem with the material. :: OK. :: He communicated very well in the classroom as well as outside the classroom during office hours. :: He told us when everything was due and told us when he fixed different homework questions. He was not always 100% clear about when assignments were due. Homework was not due on a normal schedule. :: yes. :: He communicated well. :: Dr. Baudendistel tried his best to understand the material for the first time well enough to explain it to the class, but do to him learning the material along with the class, some of the topics seemed unreasonably difficult or cumbersome at times. :: Communicated very effectively. Generally responded to emails quickly and was readily available to answer questions. :: very well. :: he communicated well on everything. :: All course communication, whether via pilot, email, or verbal was clear and effective. :: very well. :: Very well, in and out. :: Yes. :: He communicated very well!. :: perfectly. :: he communicated quite well in and outside of class. :: Very well, both in and out of class with emails and Pilot updates. :: He was very helpful and would answer questions and emails. :: Very Well. :: homework was frequently put up late and grading was slow at best. :: He did very well with communication. He uses Pilot frequently unlike a lot of professors. Polite in the classroom, and used a loud voice so people could hear. :: Almost everything that he needed the class to know they did know, because e got the information out to us as soon as possible. :: he sent me email couple times and he answered question when I asked both inside and outside of the class room. :: Craig is very quick  to answering in, and out of the classroom. :: very friendly. It felt like I could talk to him at any time if I needed help with something."
2131,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: After about half way through yes, the first half no. At the beginning I though it was the most unorganized class I had ever taken in my life. I felt like I had no chance of even getting a C. Luckily the class changed. :: yes. :: Yes they were!. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I would say so, once again this was his first time teaching the class and I also came into this with very little coding experience so from what I could tell the content was organized. :: The course content and lectures were well organized. :: No!. :: Yes. The notes followed a similar format during the week. This was a welcome as it was easy to understand the main points and details that mattered. :: Lectures were organized well. :: well organized with there were some reference sheets on pilot. :: They were well organized however, they could use more explanation before diving into solving a problem. :: The content was well organized, but was not always as thoroughly explained as some would like do to time restraints of the fifty minute time block. :: yes. :: Very well. :: they were well organized. The exam schedule and content was sort of made up as the class went on, but it was laways well-organized when presented. :: For the most part, the lectures were well organized. Several sections seemed rushed, with too little exposition into the ""why"" or ""how"" of a method, particularly the sections upon numerical methods. Some important examples from class were absent from the posted notes( particularly the GUI section), which caused some confusion preparing for exams.  The assigned homework was relevant to the current topics, and helped to reinforce the lecture material. :: 9/10. :: Yes, though at times a little rushed. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was neatly organized and prepared for us. :: yes. :: the content and lecture were well organized, and easy to understand. :: Yes. It could be better organized in the future, which I'm sure Dr. B. will fix. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: lectures were well thought out but occasionally hard to follow. :: Yes, they were very organized. :: The class had a great structure to it and allowed it to be easily learned. :: kind of. :: Yes. :: other than we needed the computers updated and couldn't do anything at one point the lectures did what they needed to."
2132,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was!. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Craig is incredibly available and responsive, even late at night. One time an email I sent around 11:30pm was answered in minutes. And if he wasn't available for some reason, his two TAs were equally as available and helpful. :: Dr.B was reasonably available on most occasions. :: Yes!. :: Yes.  I liked how he was available near the EGR 1010 help room. :: He was responsive and available. :: yes. :: He was reasonably available but his TA's were more available and always helpful. :: Dr. Baudendistel was always available during his office hours and even outside of them on most occasions, he was always available through email, even late at night. :: yes. :: Yes, very well. :: the most available professor i've ever had. :: The instructor was available online, during office hours, and outside of office hours as well. :: yes. :: More than any professor I've had so far. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was available all the time. :: yes. :: He made himself frequently available for us students. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: office hours were plentiful and useful. :: Yes, he was. He is in the help room quite often. :: The instructor was very available when it came to talking outside of the classroom or during the office hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: plenty of office hours and very responsive to emails. Made this semester a little more manageable."
2133,Craig Baudendistel,2017 Spring,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is okay. :: Any comments I said were not meant to be hurtful. You taught the class great at the end and I completely understand it being your first time teaching it. I just wish I could have done better in the beginning of the class so I didn't hurt my GPA. :: class was very interesting and I learned a lot. However the work load towards the end of the semester was pretty rough on top of a full engineering schedule. The project was hard to do while still keeping up on exams and homework. One or the other may have been more effective. :: He was one of the best professors I had this semester. :: As one who isn't super tech savvy and doesn't know a whole lot about computers and programming and all things computer science, this class was a bit more challenging for me than others, but I feel with the help provided I was able to be successful enough and I have learned a thing or two about coding. I wish the review sessions had been at times when I was available, but posting the review sheets and solutions on Pilot did help. Craig is a very kind and understanding guy, so I felt less intimidated to ask questions which was nice. The written portion for the exams were a nice way to earn points for those who struggle a bit with the actual computer portion. Being able to get help from others at the table was helpful. Overall, fun semester. P.S. Please build an Iron Man suit, you look like Tony Stark and I'm sure you're more than capable of figuring out how to build one. :: Dr.B for being his first time teaching this course, he was a good professor. :: He was not a very good teacher!. :: No. :: He put extra time and effort in to making sure he knew the information that he was teaching. The final project was a lot of work and it was hard to focus on working on that and other homework and the work for other classes. :: none. :: Exams are not usually too hard but I always felt that the exams were a bit too long for the class period. I often felt myself rushing and making simple mistakes just to finish on time. I would even leave mistakes knowing they were there just because I did not have enough time to fix them on occasion. :: Dr. Baudendistel did a good job instructing this class for the first time, but it needs work and a little more planning before teaching another. :: no. :: no. :: I will always sign up for his classes, awesome teacher. :: Instructor is doing well and did very well for first year teaching.  Experience throughout his teaching career will definitely make him even better.  Other recommendation is to maybe start python just slightly earlier so their is more time for practice. :: Wish I could take him again next semester. Great prof, great guy. Very intelligent. :: great teacher. :: He has a good base on how the class needs to be taught and tests structured. Now its only experience is needed. :: He was a very engaging instructor and I was very happy to be able to take any class that he would teach. He's also very knowledgeable and down to earth allowing him to be very approachable. :: I believe the class could use a recitation. :: Might need to hold back on some of that homework. I can understand a few hours of homework can help a lot but I spent a lot of time on it plus having the project and homework at the same time makes progress for both very slow."
2134,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Honestly, not as effective as I would have hoped. I felt like a lot of stuff was glossed over and I had to go hunting through the text to make sense of what happened during lecture. Like I was getting just pieces of the puzzle, but I didn't really know what the puzzle was supposed to look like in the first place. :: He was important to my learning of the topics and material of the course. :: The course could have been better if the lecture is well prepare. I feel like the subjects is not organize and some time I got confuse between chapters. :: Overall Dr. Mian is only moderately effective. He is very disorganized and inconsistent in the quality and relevance of the material. He has poor attention to detail and is not a stellar communicator. :: I have taken Dr. Mian twice and I have been let down both times. He simply does not explain things in an organized or clear manner. Attempting to take notes in class is difficult and you cannot piece together the information later when reviewing notes because it is so scattered. :: This i the third class Ive had Dr. Mian for. That being said, I knew what to expect coming in to the semester and got exactly what I expected. I feel he genuinely cares about his students and wants to be a good professor, but when it comes down to it he can't effectively teach. The lectures are all over the place and we seldom go over 2 problems in class even when the whole class period is set to be ""example time"". The heavy emphasis on Simulink is ridiculous when he (a professor who already isnt an effecient instructor) gives us a half-effort lecture on how to use Simulink's basic functions, then expects us to do complex homework problems. Then comes the next big problem, the TA homework graders. I have done everything correct on homework assignments and still gotten 80% of the points because of arbitrary mark-offs in the middle of my work. Even when it matches his homework solutions after the fact. :: not great. :: Class time was not well spent. Many times the objective of the lecture was unclear, and Dr. Mian was often stumbling upon his thoughts. It never felt like he had organized note but rather was improvising some lecture just to spend the entire class time. :: Fairly effective. Often seemed quite unprepared for teaching the class. Examples were not consistently clear, and occasionally used some confusing wording and explanations. :: Very poor. :: Dr. Mian is a very solid professor. He takes the time to do quite a few examples to go along with his lectures and frequently asks for questions to make sure the class understands the material being presented. :: I learned from this instructor, but it was difficult to keep myself engaged, because I felt like I didn't know what all to write in my notes. the pattern of the class was eccentric, and he gave us information in a lot of different ways, like the whiteboard or the tablet. It was hard to follow his thought process. :: The professor did not use class time wisely and, for much of the material, I had to work with others in the class to try and learn the material ourselves. :: Not the most clear and effective, but it could be worse. :: make this form stop popping up every time i log into pilot. :: I believe that Dr. Mian did a pretty good job at effectively teaching me the material. I took him twice this semester and am glad that I did. :: Not to bad. :: Alright. Lecture was normally productive. Sometimes though when jumping back to a previous chapter for no apparent reason did it became confusing since that chapter was done and we were will into the next one. :: Good. :: Very good teacher. :: Hard to understand. :: Overall the concepts came across. He tended to skim matrial a bit. Going a little to fast over some subjects. He would pause and give us time to think, but when he was going over things already written out on the projector, that was when he would go a biy fast. :: Dr. Mian is easy to understand and very good at explaining the material in class. He is very attentive to questions and thoroughly responds to them to aid the student in understanding."
2135,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, the instructor evaluate me on the expectations that were listed in the syllabus. :: yes. :: For exams, yes, but quiz grading is poor because even simple problems with the correct answer and adequate work shown can receive half credit. :: Our work was evaluated as stated in the syllabus. :: not really. :: Mostly, sometimes he would do a poor job explaining a concept. I would solve it on the homework the way we had learned in class and no matter how much effort I had put forth, my home work grades/quiz grades would suffer. I had only solved certain things the way he had explained them. :: Yes. :: The quiz and homework grades were a complete crap shoot. you either get a 70 or a 10.  You never knew. :: Yes. The syllabus outlined the class very closely and there was nothing that deviated from material that was stated in the document. :: Yes. :: The instructor graded the exams the way that was described in the syllabus. The homework and the quizzes were graded so horribly, I could have taken half of my quizzes back to him to get re-graded because they were graded so badly. There was a quiz that said, ""What do the terms 'System' and 'Dynamics' mean to you?"" and I got a 30% on the quiz even though the answer should be completely subjective based on the problem statement. Many other quizzes were graded similarly to this. :: Yes. :: I believe that he did for the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He did indeed. :: Yes. :: I'm pretty sure. :: Yes, work evaluation was based on the syllabus."
2136,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes, class started on time and the full time was used. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He started class on time but usually about 5 minutes into the lecture, he either forgot his notes or his flash drive. We even started class using a students notes because he did not have his. :: Class would generally begin and end on time, though he would mix in breaks varying between seconds to minutes that often did not help much. :: yes. :: Yes. Professor Mian was always on time and used the class time effectively. :: There were some instances where he was a little disorganized and had to run back to his office in order to retrieve the notes he needed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. It was very rare to get out early. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was very routine. :: yes he went over a lot of the time. :: Yes, he was punctual. :: Class was started on time and used the full class period."
2137,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He really wanted us to interact with him, but I never understood the current lecture enough to formulate a question other than ""What the heck is going on right now?"". :: He would repeatedly stop and ask if we understood.  If we didn't he would explain the concept again. :: It is clear that Dr. Mian loves what he does, which is nice. He also explains how our work can be applied to real life systems. :: he cares but is not a good professor. :: I was very interested to learn about System Dynamics; however, Dr. Mian made it very difficult to pay attention in class and learn. :: Despite some unclear examples/explanations, you could tell he was trying to explain everything in a way we all understood. :: He tried to but he is just a better researcher than a professor. :: Professor Mian encouraged us to talk to him if we had issues with the material, frequently asked for questions, and even gave us some time to talk among ourselves to clear things up with the material being presented. :: He continually attempted to ask questions to the class to get them engaged in what he was talking about. :: Yes. :: He always tries to help as much as he can. He sometimes struggles to communicate clearly so that is the only issue with his teaching. :: Dr. Mian was always looking for people to ask questions. This is something I can really appreciate. :: I would say 7 out of 10. :: Answered questions asked during class, modified problems with different parameters to show how things became affected by it. :: Yes, he paused to let students absorb information. :: He was very interested in us learning and participating in class. :: Yes, Dr. Mian was interested in the class's learning and would explain things further if there were topics that were unclear."
2138,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He communicated well enough to get me on the right path once I came up with questions. :: His communication was great.  When homework or quizzes were posted, he would notify use vis email. :: He communicated well. :: his emails were helpful. :: He tried his best to answer questions. :: Sufficiently well in both cases. :: Not well he was confusing to listen to and his notes were poorly laid out. :: Very effectively. :: He did admit to having broken English, and I feel like he mixed up a few of the words he tried to say, or referenced the incorrect part of a diagram or number in the problem. :: Effectively. :: Struggles to make his teaching clear, but he tries his best. Always available to help. :: There were a few times when there was some slight hiccups for the most part though I have no complaints. :: Yes. :: Good, emails were sent out went homework got posted. :: very. :: Pretty effective. :: Very effective communicating in and out of the classroom."
2139,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes and no. The notes made sense save for it being hard to see the 'big picture' of the problem solving process. Like why I'm doing the operations that I'm being told lead to the solution. :: For the most part they were.  Sometimes he would skip around. :: not really. :: No. :: No. :: no, not at all. :: No, class time did not seemed organized at all, often times he would show a very basic (UNSOLVED) example that he had already don't on a pdf file. He would talk it through but never really solve the example, the homework seemed to be more difficult than it needed to be due to the lack of examples. :: Yes. :: NOT AT ALL. :: Yes. He had many powerpoints to go along with the lecture and example problems. :: Content was organized in an order that made sense, but the lectures felt like they were off topic, or had several topics to talk about. I would suggest having a more concrete idea of what the lecture needs to convey, or stick to a plan more rigidly. :: Not even close to organized. He just kind of made stuff up as he went and it was hard to learn what he was trying to express to us. :: I'd rate him 7/10 on this question. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Usually. It became confusing when we jumped back to a previous chapter that we were done going through. :: mostly. :: Most of the time. :: Yes, content was clear and lectures were well organized."
2140,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: mostly. :: Yes. :: for the most part. :: Yes. He was always easy to contact. :: Yes, I had no problems in this regard. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes more than I expected. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: absolutely. :: I never really sought him out, so I can't comment on this. :: Yes, even when traveling, Dr. Mian was available through email."
2141,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- What was this class again? Differential equations II or circuits II  or something? And what was all that EE stuff anyway?  ALSO why didn't my ""advisor"" even know what this was?. :: No. :: Please let someone other that Dr. Mian  (i.e. Dr. Slater) teach this class. The topics are too important for us to have to go through the same grabage we had to deal with in Mechanics of Materials. In that class, we could get away with is with prior knowledge from Statics. That puts a burden on Mech Design 1 to recap what we were supposed to learn in MoM but didnt. I do not want to pay all of that money to get nothing in return from Dr. Mian. :: I felt the grading was not on the same scale. Often times a bunch of us would get different quiz scores but when cross checking the quizzes, the points he had taken off did not align with each quiz. It felt he was grading each one on a different scale. :: No. :: Very solid professor. :: I think switching back and forth between the screen and the whiteboard disrupt the flow of the class. I would suggest using one of those materials per lecture, but shy away from using both, unless you plan on switching for the rest of the lecture. :: No. :: Enjoyed the class and the teacher. :: No. :: It was annoying when the online quizzes had a 20 minute time limit. I don;t think it did anything but it was annoying, especially when the first couple online quizzes were unlimited time. :: Overall, I enjoyed the class. :: I learned a lot, and look forward to taking another course this summer with Dr. Mian."
2142,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- not effective. :: laid back. :: Dr. Mian is a professor who cares about the understanding of his student, but he is not a good communicator. He is hard to follow, understand, and pay attention to. :: Excellent. :: Instructor is hard to understand and not very well organized. Lectures did not provide anything beneficial in terms of learning. :: He was effective in my learning. I don't feel that this class was very necessary sometimes, as we would not learn new things during class but review things that were leaned in previous courses. :: Fine. :: I didn't need to show up to 1 class for anything this semester. The people who came in to talk were boring and just talked about stuff we've done in other classes. He didn't communicate on due dates so some things snuck up on us. He also didn't make evryone turn in their PowerPoint at the same time so some groups has an extra week and a half to complete their PowerPoint and that's not right. We also had to go the first day so we didn't get to see what the PowerPoint should look like and other groups did. A Dropbox for the PowerPoint should have been put up the morning of the presentations  so that people couldn't make improvements and they all would have had the same due date to complete it. :: He was very effective at explaining what we were supposed to be doing outside of class, as well as making sure we were doing everything. :: ineffective. :: Not very effective. :: good. :: Not very effective. :: he is the best instructor in this course. :: Good. :: As this is his first time teaching the class, there have been issues with communication of deadlines, but overall he has been a good professor. :: a. :: so effective. :: Good. :: Dr. Mian did a great job for being his first time teaching senior design. You could tell sometimes he was still trying to get in the swing of things, but I enjoyed the class. :: The course is just wasting of time  We should've might only two time in two weeks  There is nothing to learn- class time is too bad 7:35 is too early. :: I would describe his effectiveness as not very. :: Extremely effective. :: Very good"

2145,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- No, he had quite a few guest speakers that gave in class examples of this course. This course would be better with real life professional as opposed to cookie cutter intellectual examples. :: Yes. :: He would stop and ask if we understood. If we didn't he would explain it again. :: yes. :: He met with each group individually every other week to check on our progress and offer help if we needed it. :: he didn't. :: He didn't. :: enthusiastic. :: he is very nice. :: He made sure we were always busy and trying to learn new things from the guest speakers. :: Yes he did. :: Goood. :: Held meetings with groups in his office every few weeks. :: Very well"

He would notify us if class was cancelled and meeting times in his office for our projects. :: yes. :: He communicated very well. :: usually, USUALLY, sent an email the day before he cancelled or delayed the start of class. :: ok. :: good. :: His emails were helpful for due dates. :: he care about the students and he always makes an appointment with us. :: He was very good at responding to questions and comments and he was very accommodating to our schedules. :: A little slow at times, but this is understandable as he is a very busy man. :: 80%. :: somewhat effectively, with emails. :: Very good"
2147,Akm Mian,2017 Spring,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- well. :: No. :: There was no course content except for maybe two or three lectures. Mostly a waste of time. No fault of the instructor, just time that could have been spent working on our actual projects. :: Yes. :: NO. :: I was just review of things previously learned so I guess so. :: Sometimes. :: Yes. :: depends on who he had come in and teach for him that week. :: yes. :: yes. :: somewhat but they always felt drawn out. :: yes. :: Yes they were. :: Yes, for the most part. :: Sometimes. :: the course content and lectures were given by other staff and faculty, so they were well done. :: Yes"

Dr Mian make it less unpleasant though. He seems like a good guy. :: Yes. :: Instructor is not effective at all and should not be teaching engineering courses to serious students. :: No. :: no. :: I'm glad I have a different teacher in change of my groups senior project. :: no. :: no. :: I feel that the senior design lecture is an utter waste of time. The class could be boiled down to two weeks where we cover how to write a proposal. I get nothing from the lectures and all of the assignments seem like busy work. This should be a freshman level class, not a capstone class. Anyone who has a real job (the majority of the class) has already had to do the things we learn at their job. Its insulting to have to sit through a waste of time learning how to use MS word when I could be at work being productive and actually learning. :: no. :: Great job Dr. Mian. :: Should not meet ever weeks  Because there is nothing to do from  7:35 in the morning !!!. :: Thanks he is the best Dr in wright state very understanding his students"

I loved how his class was set up for us to do MATLAB problems with him, and in between each problem he as well as a TA would walk around to make sure we understand the process for each technique. He never made me feel bad for not understanding a topic as quickly as other students and instead took time to sit down with me and explain it thoroughly.

I will take his class again and would recommend him to anyone. :: If more professor were like Scott Thomas, Wright State would have a top of the line engineering school. :: I enjoyed this class and he always made it an enjoyable experience. I enjoyed this class and learned a lot from this professor. :: Instead or doing Working Model on our own I would suggest that these examples be shown in class as a learning assistant to prove that the math makes sense. :: Good teacher. :: i recommend him to every student. :: He's a really good professor.. :: Fantastic teacher. :: no. :: Bon Jovi said it best ""We're half way there Livin' on a prayer Take my hand and we'll make it I swear, livin' on a prayer"" How I felt the whole time. :: Class seemed a bit slow for me, but easy to understand. :: Nope."
2166,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- really good. :: The instructor was very important to my learning of the subject.  This is my fourth time having him as a professor and he meets my expectations every time. :: The professor is a very knowledgable in the subject of heat transfer. He knows how to present it and has a decent format of doing. Does have a habit of getting off topic sometime which can be bad when there is so much important material to learn. :: In class examples are good. can get off topic at times. :: Knows what he's talking about. Exams are very difficult. :: He is very effective.  He makes sure everyone has the same materials we could ever use to succeed in the class.  He posts the homework problems and solutions on his website, as well as past exams and student evaluations.  This makes it easy to learn the material. :: Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor and very passionate about what he teaches. :: Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor. I always know that I will learn a lot in a course that he teaches. :: very good. :: very effective. :: Very effective. I've had Scott Thomas before for both Statics and MATLAB, and will have him again for Thermo II. In each case, his notes are very detailed and easy to understand, he is always more than willing to answer any relevant question, and he very clearly explains how to apply the theory to practical problems. He helped us understand when and where to make certain assumptions and why they were justified, all the while keeping the course material interesting and the classes entertaining. Consistently one of the best professors I've had at this university, and by far one of the best in the department. :: Its scott. He is a great instructor. :: Very effective. All knowing syllabus kept us on track. :: Extremely effective. :: I usually have trouble paying attention during 80 minute classes. However, Dr. Thomas made lectures exciting by being enthusiastic. :: He was a very effective instructor. Very knowledgeable and willing to stop and help anyone. :: Scott is a very effective instructor who organizes everything pertaining to his class well before the semester even begins and then follows his plan. :: Dr. Thomas is an excellent professor. I feel as if I fully understand the material presented to me. :: I felt he was effective. Class was structure well, going over the concepts first and then example problems to help further explain them. No hidden surprises, always tried to be up front and straight forward. I felt I learned some things and it helped going back over some of the fluid dynamics stuff. :: Very Effective. Very Fair. Love him. :: Dr. Thomas is a very effective instructor. He is very interested in the subject, and very energetic in his delivery of the content! Made it fun to come to lecture and fun to learn!"
2167,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes, the instructor evaluate me on the expectations that were listed in the syllabus. :: The instructor takes the syllabus very seriously and follows it word for word. :: Yes. :: Ok the first exam we had 3 chapters to cover. The exam had 4 questions and 2 of them were from chapter 2. The other 2 were from chapter 1 and 3. Chapter 2 was worth 20/30 points. Chapter 1 was worth 4/30. Chapter 3 was worth 6/20. This means that chapter 2 was worth 66 percent of the exam. That is terrible for seeing what people know out of all three chapters. It needs to be weighted better because every chapter is important. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Our work is evaluated exactly like the syllabus says it will be. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. The syllabus was very detailed and organized, and we never broke from it. :: He was fair in his grading, I am hesitant to say he is fair yet until I take his final, his exams are a thing of nightmares on occation. :: Yes. :: The syllabus was, as promised, never wrong or questioned, and everything in it was well defined. I feel as though the instructor graded fairly and consistently. :: Yes. Dr. Thomas always began lectures by reviewing the ALMIGHTY SYLLABUS OF HEAT TRANSFER. :: Yes. :: Yes, he is a very fair grader. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas sticks to his syllabus to a T. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: Expectations were very clear in the syllabus."
2168,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes, class was started on time everyday and the class time was well spent. :: This instructor starts class at the time exactly and uses the full time because there is so much material to cover. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Always started class exactly on time, and rarely released early, except in cases where we were assigned a problem at the end of class. Those days, we would maybe leave a couple minutes early depending on how quickly we solved the problem. :: WIthin seconds. :: Yes. :: ""Two o' clock exactly"" every single day. :: He always started on time. A couple times he let out a few minutes early, but heat transfer is the kind of topic that requires several minutes to do an example or talk about theory, so there wasn't much that could have been done in that small amount of time anyway. :: Every. Single. Time. :: Yes, there were a few classes that ended early, but we still remained on schedule. :: Yes, class time was very well spent. :: Yes. :: Always on time and uses full class period. :: Class started at ""two o'clock exactly!"" every day, and the full period was used."
2169,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- always answered questions when asked. :: Yes, he taught and explained thing very clearly.  He was always willing to help if a concept was not understood. :: He was always more than willing to answer any question in class and he always takes time outside of class to make sure the student understands what is going on. :: yes. :: He answered everyone's questions. :: He often used great examples and interacted with students consistently. :: Dr. Thomas is very passionate about what he does and he always provides us with real world applications. He also provides hints as to what we will get to do if we carry on our education in graduate school. :: yes. :: yes, was not interested in the subject prior to the class. Now this has become a very enjoyable lecture. :: He was always happy to respond to questions and would give further explanations and outside knowledge even if that example was not inherently in the scope of the course material. Even if it was outside of what we'd be typically learning, it is definitely still useful and enjoyable to learn some outside information, especially when the actual course material was not delayed or simplified as a result. We've had some very interesting discussions in this heat transfer class. :: He would take and ask questions, very engaging. :: Yes. :: The instructor has boundless enthusiasm for the topic, and is willing to go deeper into the learning process by showing us pictures and figures, as well as answering hypothetical questions if they are conducive to an understanding of the material. :: Made sure to ask if we had questions after explaining something. :: He would constantly ask about our understanding to ensure we were up to speed. :: He was always making sure everyone knew what he was talking about. There were many times, however, that a student would ask really stupid questions that didn't have much with what we were trying to learn and Scott would take time to try and answer it. This would have been better if he just met Scott in his office hour instead of wasting everyone's time. :: Dr. Thomas is extremely passionate about the classes he teaches and cares about each of his students. He learns students names and calls them by them every time you ask a question. I told him my name one time and he never forgot it!. :: Answered questions in class and wouldn't move on until he was sure the question was fully answered and all confusion eliminated from student's minds, no matter how small. :: Gave a lot of real world examples, showing the applications of heat transfer. :: Dr. Thomas showed interest in my learning by calling on me and other students by name and making sure to take extra time to clear up any questions on the subject. Examples were easy to understand and were fun to pay attention to."
2170,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well. :: Great. :: The instructor always got his point across in class and outside of class he was always available for consultation. :: good. :: Very well. :: He communicated well. :: He communicated well. :: Very well. :: yes. :: very effective, always available. :: Very effectively. :: Very well. :: Very well. Open office hours greatly helped. :: The instructor was clear and concise with his examples and question answers, and did his best to understand and work out what the student was asking when the question may have been phrased rather strangely. :: He answered all my emails within a few hours. :: Very effectively. :: Effectively. :: Awesome! He will communicate to you until you fully understand. He will not move on from a conversation until you ensure him that he has answered your question. :: Good. Syllabus was displayed every class to reminder us of up coming events. Always knew what was expected of us. :: Very responsive to emails, and was of great help during office hours. :: Dr. Thomas was very effective communicating in and out of class."
2171,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes, the lectures were well organized and very useful. :: The course content was well organized and put together in a good fashion. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, very well organized. :: Very much so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Very much so. Everything was outlined in the syllabus and the course material followed a very logical progression. :: Most organized proff besides sucosky. :: Yes. :: The instructor had the notes and lectures planned down almost to the minute, and followed them religiously. :: Yes. Class was organized in a logical manner that expanded upon each method of heat transfer. :: Yes. :: Extremely well organized. :: Very well organized. :: Yes. Only complaint is we didn't go over any questions in class for Chapter 12 in class, which made it a bit harder to understand. But it was understandable due to time constraints and made sense after going through Chapter 13. :: Very organized. :: Very well organized"
2172,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: The instructor was always available during all of these times. :: yes. :: Always will help you if you email him questions. :: Yes. :: He went above and beyond in this regard. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Very quick to respond. :: Yes. :: Absolutely. I never felt intimidated by the instructor, or afraid to ask a question either in class or in office hours. :: Yes. He was great about answering emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas is always available. :: Yes. :: YEs he was. :: Very responsive."
2173,Scott Thomas,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: No. :: Overall the class is taught very well. The only thing that is hard is sometimes things either get going to fast or we get to sidetracked in the class. :: no. :: My one major criticism of how Dr. Thomas formats his courses is with the homework. All of the students appreciate getting the worked out answers to the homework because that allows us to move forward when we are stuck and to help have extra examples from which to learn. I personally think that doing homework without knowing the correct answer only causes people to practice incorrect methodology, as they don't know if they did it correctly or if they need to revise their method, and only perfect practice makes perfect. But because of how long the homework problems became in the end, mixed with how many problems were assigned, many people had to rely on copying the answers quickly because there was not enough time to finish the homework on their own. This is compounded by the fact that we often learned crucial information in the class before the homework was due, meaning we effectively had one and a half days to do most of the homeworks unless we just copied. Also, having to scan in the homework and bring it to class was never helpful to me and it added a significant burden to preparing and finishing my homework. :: The one thing I don't like about the lectures is that a talkative student can disrupt the entire class period. I like that Dr. Thomas encourages questions, but sometimes we spend way too much time on questions from individuals that should be handled in either office hours or by e-mail. :: Actually looking forward to Thermo II, if that's possible. :: Keep it up Scurvy Scott!!. :: No. :: I would recommend this professor to anyone pursuing an engineering degree. I have enjoyed every class I have had with him. :: Only real issue I had was when the first homework was due. A few people had never had Dr. Thomas before and did not realize he did homework online. Although it was outlined in the syllabus, he forgot to mention it during the first class causing a few people get 0% on their first homework. For reference, I had Scott previously and was familiar with this policy, but there were a handful of individuals who weren't. :: Great experience! Thank you Dr. Thomas!!!!!. :: It might be worth going through and reviewing the questions for Chapter 12 homework. As I was going through it and the posted solutions, I kept finding equations that I had no idea where they came from until we started Chapter 13. I assume this is in part due to the similar nature of 12 and 13 but it made for a very frustrating time when I couldn't find the formulas being used in the answers. The only other thing is I felt chapter 12 was much harder than chapter 13. Chapter 13 I was actually making sense of and felt I had a decent understanding of after class time and working through the homework. :: I really enjoyed my time this semester learning with Dr. Thomas, and I am looking forward to continuing to work with him in the fall in another course!"
2174,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Excellent. :: I think Dr. Menart is one of the most effective professors I've ever had. :: Excellent. :: Instructor provides very good lectures that help learning the material. :: best ME instructor ive had. :: The instructor did a great job at describing not only the math behind the subject but also the theory which helped tremendously with understanding the math. :: Great professor, probably my favorite professor I have had during my four years at Wright State. Very clear in explanations and gives all the details you need to succeed as a student. :: superb. :: Dr. Menart is very intelligent and a great lecturer, dry at time, but definitely knows the material well. :: extremely great. :: He was a very good instructor.

The course syllabus was comprehensive and he stuck to the policies listed in it."
2176,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. Too much knowledge to  know and not enough class time. :: Absolutely!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: The instructor always used the entire class period time and started on time. He was also willing to answer questions at the end of class for as long as needed. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: he routinely start class on time but he also takes some extra time. but it is totally acceptable because he is welling to answer any question you'll have after class. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did, but the classroom clock he'd go off of is a few minutes slow, so we'd get out a few minutes past time. :: yes. :: He got things started on time, it took a little to set up the computer stuff, but not too long. He used the time effectively."
2177,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Used all resources available to help make sure everyone didn't miss any information. :: By being super approachable and taking the time to make sure we knew what was going on and the significance of the work we were doing. :: Very well. :: Provided good lectures and posted them online for review. :: real life examples. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in my learning by answering questions for me not only in class but through email and after class had ended. :: By answering any questions we may have with the best possible answer he could give. Also asking us questions to try to get us to think about the important details. :: good. :: He wants to engage the class and cares about students' learning. :: he made the material really easy to understand and he is easy to follow. Dr Menart does something really good but he might not notice it which is ""writing every equation even if it was written before"", not a lot of instructors does that but this small point make me able to comprehend the materials presented in the class. :: Yes very much so. :: a. :: His questions are very different then what we have in class  Is too difficult. :: He taught the class, and was always willing to answer questions. :: yed. :: He was very helpful when asked questions and related the material to real life situations to help us comprehend the concepts easier."
2178,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very Good. :: Very effectively. :: Very well. :: Well. :: great. always responded via email and gave updates. :: The instructor communicated well. Easy to understand and communicate with. :: Very good, even if he found a mistake he did during class he would email us about it the same night telling us about the mistake. :: good. :: he was good about due dates. :: he was available every time, even out of his office hours because it was really helpful for me because i had a conflict with another class with his office hours. :: He was one of the best engineering professors and he was the best at explaining everything. :: a. :: 80%. :: Very well. :: Very nice person and friendly and  funny- i like him i would take with him any other class. :: He communicated well both in class and out of class (via email and Pilot). :: yes. :: He communicated very effectively. I did not need to talk to him outside of class, but in class, he was very good at getting concepts and information across effectively."
2179,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Man, have you SEEN those hierarchy style notes? Very well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: extremely. content available in pdf. Menart system should be used campus wide. :: The content and lectures were organized, however, the technology used was a hindered the instructors performance a little bit. The smart board would have issues during the lectures and it was hard to read the writing on the smart board. :: Yes. :: Very organized!!!. :: yes they were. I really liked having the lectures recorded for future reference. :: yes. :: Yes very well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very organised. :: Yes, they were. :: always. :: The lectures and course content were very well organized. Everything was written in outline format which helped to keep things in a readable and comprehensive fashion."

2181,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 3360,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- One of the best engineer professors. :: Dr Menart is one of the the only professors I've ever had that actually made me consider getting a graduate degree instead of getting out of school and never looking back. :: Thank you Dr. Menart. One of the best professors who have tought me. :: James Menart is a very good professor and we need more like him. :: Great professor. Thank you for a good semester. :: The only complaint I have is that sometimes he would mention something ""one"" time during a lecture and give no example on it or give any further explanation on it (so you would think its not relative, important) but then he would put it on the exam to trip up the students. That is not fair. :: I thought the course was really good, some side story and more animation of the subject would be nice. The class is very enjoyable, (I have some class where student just come in and take note and it really dry). :: recording the lecture and not giving a grade on the homework were a brilliant idea. This point forced me to take longer time solving and understanding the homework without the fear of the home work grade. Another thing that i would like to mention, if i had a professor like Dr. Menart in all of my engineering classes i will be a much better and knowledgable student. :: a. :: No. :: He is the best instructor in the university we all like him he is funny and very  generous. :: No. :: no. :: He was one of my all time favorite teachers. He set high standards and was very interested and helpful in you keeping those standards. I would take any class he teaches in a flash."
2182,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Explanations were clear and in depth. Examples supplemented and aided in understanding. :: Very well run class. Material well explained and examples to fully explain theory. Notes and lecture provide ample information for completing homework and tests with confidence. :: Very effective. :: best instructor. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Menart was able to break down a complicated topic into simple detailed lectures. The examples he did in class were helpful for both the homework and when reviewing for exams. :: He is one of the best professor one can have in his education years. He is very kind and very effective. He focuses on every single point of the problem and tries to solve it in the easiest way possible. Also he spend so much time on explaining the actual meaning of an equation or a symbol so that the students can connect it to a physical or real life meaning. :: 1. :: Excellent. :: Very effective, enjoy ability to go back and watch previous lectures to confirm notes or if I can't make it to class. :: Dr. James Menart is a very disciplined and uses time effectively. As I am an international student, there will be little bit problem in understanding english but he teaches so well that everyone can grasp the knowledge. :: I've never seen a Professor of his kind.He starts teaching from basics even for graduate students and his online recording is the best i have  seen. :: Dr Menart is a hard worker professor, he try's to simplify the material as possible and make sure that all students will achieve the main purpose of the class. Personally, he transferred me to the next level in solar engineering. :: Dr. Menart is very good in overall effectiveness in the class. He is very much interested in dealing with the students and made me feel very comfortable in the class. he is that one professor i will definitely look upto. :: Average. :: he is very effective instructor. :: James Menart is a good instructor and knows his subject very well. He has the best knowledge for this subject and explains it very well. :: 100% efficient. :: I think the class was a little boring. I do acknowledge that you tried to keep us interested by regularly showing us news about the industry; but, there was something missing. Unfortunately, I don't know exactly what was missing.  I am not sure what the requirement for this class is, but I wish we could have done something more practical to link the theory with the reality of the solar industry. Overall, I still think you are a great professor. I really like the fact that you are always in you office to answer questions. It is very helpful.  Keep doing the great job!!!. :: Professor has been able to impart every bit of his knowledge to the students in the class. The way he has taught and conducted the whole session is simply outstanding. :: Dr. Menart does a good job of reviewing important content from prerequisite courses. He also provides sufficient detail of how certain equations and methods were derived. I think his best quality as an instructor is his ability to focus the class on practical approaches to solve the problem at hand. :: I feel that I have gained a good understanding of the material."
2183,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. Work was as described in syllabus. :: Yes, course structure very well thought out and followed. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, While challenging the programming homework was effective at helping students understand lecture material. :: Yes, he did.

He would say since some students came late he have the right to keep them for few minutes. Honestly he never wasted my time or in my opinion the students time over all. He uses every minutes to do his best in explaining the lecture. :: 1. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He manages time effectively. :: Yes . He always comes to the class before time so that he can start on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes,always. :: yes he was always on time. :: Yes. :: yes he always starts class on time. :: yes. :: Professor Menart has been the most punctual person i have ever seen in my whole career. :: Yes, Dr. Menart always starts and ends on time and uses class time effectively. :: Yes."
2185,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes. Made a point to show us how the material was relavent to industry and possible future careers as engineers. :: Responds to questions in class and by email. Genuinely cares about the student understanding the material. :: provided well worked out and helpful examples. :: enthusiastic. :: Answered many questions in office hours that really helped me this semester. :: Dr. Menart used examples that were similar  to real life engineering problems. He attempted to engage with the class through questions, which most of the time went us answered. :: He spent so much time in explaining how would we as a future engineers could change something. For example when he described how the new renewable solar energy can be developed by so many ways and one of these ways might come from one of us. He also was funny about few things such as the novel prize and how if anyone in the class would get it he should give credit to him too. I honestly think that by just saying how this class or this course can help us as future engineers it got my interest and it made me so interested in attending every class and not miss a single information about solar energy. :: 1. :: Excellent. :: By being extremely engaged in the course materials frequently explaining why the designs for each type of collector were made that way. :: By showing live examples from real world. :: He always tells us about the future of Subject creating interest to students. :: Good. :: Very well. :: he will deal the subject with the help of examples which make me understand a bit more and easy for me. :: yes. :: it was good. :: By giving examples relevant to topic and discussing the latest news regarding the topics which we are studying. :: he explain every thing detail. :: He showed us data/news of the industry. :: He has always been super efficient to demonstrate the subject. For the benefit of the students he also use to record the whole class so that any student can go through it at home in case they miss the class. :: Dr. Menart keeps the lecture engaging, even when going through long equations. He also shows interesting articles that pertain to the course."
2186,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effective. Responded to emails timely. :: Very good communication. :: very effectively. :: good. :: Very effective. :: Pilot was kept up to date and all due date and exam dates were brought up in lecture. :: He did great. He always asks for if there was any questions after he finishes a section or two, and he never jumps to another lecture or section of the book before asking if there was anything that was understandable. The only thing that he might not do very quick is answering by e-mail. it takes him about 3-5 days to answer an e-mail which can be frustrating if I had a homework duo very soon. However, he never misses his office hours and he gives an entire week period for every homework. So students should have 2 days of office hours to ask questions. Overall he is always there when needed and he would answer every question as much as he could. :: 1. :: Excellent. :: Effectively. :: He give time for students both in class and during office hours. :: Excellent  10/10 (ten out of ten). :: Excellent. :: Perfect. :: excellent. :: very effective. :: He communicated really well. :: Pretty good. :: he was the best professor till now i was taught under. :: Very good. There is nothing to complain about. He is always available for students. :: He has always been helpful and never ever averted any sort of query or question. Rather he is always ready to take doubts even if we go to him outside of his office hours. :: Dr. Menart is a good communicator and always responds to emails promptly. He also grades homework and exams very quickly. :: There was good interaction with the class during lectures."
2187,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Very well organized. :: Yes, material was very well put together, notes would flow into the homework, followed by homework leading up to tests. I am confident in the material due to organization and teaching styles. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, each problem given was solved by breaking the problem into multiple simpler steps. :: Yes very well, he used to label everything and name everything in order. He goes from the easy materials to the hard materials to ensure that students can follow up on him. Also he give detailed lectures and he records his lectures so in case someone missed something he can always go back and review the lecture. :: 1. :: Yes. :: Yes, maybe should have spent a bit more time on photovoltiacs considering of the potential growth in this facet of the industry. But enjoyed the class nevertheless. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes everything was perfect. :: It was not well organized it was organized perfectly.

2188,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Very much so. :: I never tried but probably. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: he never misses his office hours. He also comes to class early so if I had a question I can go before the class start and ask him or even after that class. He gives about 10 mins before and after the class for individual questions. However, it is best to go to his office for questions as he will clearly and calmly answer the question and even maybe give suggestions about the problem. :: 1. :: Yes. :: Yes, instructor was prompt answering all communications. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes he was. :: oh, yes!!! I heard, it was possible to call him to ask question. That's awesome. :: Absolutely. :: Yes, Dr. Menart was always very responsive when I emailed him with questions. :: Yes, email responses where usually within 24 hours and office hours were at appropriate times based on the class time."
2189,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 4540,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- One of the best instructors at Wright State. Cares about his students and the material he is teaching. When the teacher cares about what he is teaching, it makes the learning process so much more enjoyable and meaningful. I have performed well in this class due to the experience and general interest of the topic Dr. Menart provides. He has provided me with knowledge that I will be able to use in future applications. :: no. :: I think a Lab for this course would be really cool. :: Stay the same Dr. Menart do not change and keep being great. Thank you for trying to help me find a job earlier. I know it did not work out very well but thank you for trying. You have given me the best 3 classes I have ever taken in my life. I thank you for that!. :: 1. :: No. :: Some reference idea of what values we are expected to get on the excel homework would have been helpful. When one misplaced parentheses can effect all of your answers having rough idea (maybe a range) of the what the numbers should look like would helpful. :: I would really appreciate, if Our University would give tougher subjects to DR.Menart ,so that he will be explaining right from the scratch and would be easier for student to learn the subject. :: No. :: He is the best. :: he is all in all a perfect professor that  any student will be dream of get along with and make every student learn something out of their interest . thanks you veyy much professor. :: NO. :: He has good knowledge over the course subject. He does good in class and gives interesting questions in tests. :: He is one of the best instructor which Wright State University has. Hope he will continue with subject so all upcoming students get best knowledge about this subject. :: excellent. :: I love you (as a professor). :: I am extremely glad to be taught under professor Menart and i hope i can take many more subjects under him. :: This was my first graduate class after completing undergrad 5 years ago, so I was unsure how quickly I would be able to get back in the groove. Dr. Menart made the transition easy by providing a solid review of prerequisite course material (heat transfer), then focusing on the most important equations and methods for this course with plenty of example problems to help with homework and exam preparation. I felt the exams were fair and reflected the lecture and homework content. Dr. Menart is an excellent professor, and if I decide to continue with more graduate classes, I will seek out his classes in the future."
2190,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 7330,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Effective. :: Decent. :: Excellent. :: Effective, kept the class engaged without diverting needlessly away from the material. :: The instructor was overall very effective at facilitating the the general understanding of the course material and assigned problems. :: Dr. Menart did a great job teaching this course. He used class time well and made it easy to learn. :: Dr. James Menart is a very disciplined and uses time effectively. As I am an international student, there will be little bit problem in understanding english but he teaches so well that everyone can grasp the knowledge. :: excellen. :: Very effective, keep up the good work. :: Very effective, lecture is very clear. :: Instructor was very effective at explaining concepts and solution methods. Analogies to other, more easily observed, phenomena strengthened the explanations. :: Dr. Menart is a excellent professor, and he is preparing every class sufficiently. :: Excellent. :: Excellent. He has an ease in reaching to all the students. :: Dr. Menart was effective at conveying what was effectively a very dry and boring topic. The class was typically spent in a manner well suited to learning but the HW was structured around a self learning ideology which, while it may work well for some, did not help my understanding of the material. The class content does not appear to allow the time for it, however spending the class prior to an exam reviewing the required content would help students in better completing the exam, especially by giving us an idea of what areas to study. :: good. :: Dr. Menart is by the the best instructor for this course.  His examples are very easy to understand and demonstrate the learning subject well.  He is very kind and is always willing to help students, even outside of office hours.  In my opinion, he is the best instructor, overall, in the mechanical engineering program. :: Very, very good. Dr. Menart has an uncanny ability to make a student think about the problem. For me personally, he rekindled the excitement about thermodynamics and mechanical engineering. In other words, Dr. Menart made heat transfer look like the most interesting study in the universe.   The topic is very advanced. Only because of his teaching abilities, it seemed easier than even my undergraduate introduction to the topic. :: Perfect nothing to point out excellent in teaching. :: Great. :: He is a very good speaker. I would rate him 10/10. :: Organization: explains clearly, is well prepared, makes difficult topics easy to understand, uses examples, details, analogies, metaphors, and variety in modes of explanation to make material not only understandable but memorable, makes the objectives of the course and each class clear and establishes a context for material. :: Good teaching Clears the concepts very well Like the teaching method. :: He has all the materials and good assignment questions for this subject. It is very well prepared and organized. Dr. Menart even has the best knowledge for this subject and explains it very well. :: cool most efficient. :: The style in which Dr. Menart teaches is very effective. His writing notes on the computer makes it much easier to read and follow along, as sometimes writing on the white board is small and difficult to read/follow. He explains things in a very well-thought out way, and I appreciate that given this is a graduate level class. :: excellent. :: Dr. Menart is a great professor. and I think other Professors in mechanical engineering department need to sit in his class and learn how to teach."

2192,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 7330,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, instructor was very good at starting class exactly at the beginning of the class period and immediately diving into the course material. :: Yes the instructor was always punctual and prepared for the lecture even before the scheduled start time for the sessions. :: Yes. :: Yes. He uses time effectively. :: yes. :: Yes Always used the full time. :: Yes. :: Class almost always started on time. Class typically ended a few minutes early, but the material in the syllabus was covered in sufficient detail that there was little need to continue for those extra few minutes. :: Yes,  5-star evaluation (strongly agree). :: Yes. :: Yes, on time. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes and yes. Again, mundane. :: Always on time i may go late but my prof.is always on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yup on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes."
2193,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 7330,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- examples. :: Homework. :: Excellent. :: The instructor demonstrated an interest in our learning by routinely checking in the lectures to see if the concepts were being fully grasped and even adding extensions onto topics to further understanding of the subject. :: He was always helpful when asked about homework and did a good job engaging students in class. :: By showing live examples. :: yes. :: Tried to engage the class in discussion. :: Available for questions in office, asks questions in class to check understanding. :: The instructor was available for consultation during office hours and through email. :: He could explain problems in very basic point of view so that all students are able to capture what he taught. :: Very well. :: Best thing about him is, he explains the complex concept starting from basic example, which makes the concept easy. This is what I need. :: Yes. :: good. :: Dr. Menart is always open to questions and routinely asks questions throughout class to help him gauge the class's understanding of the subject material.  If he finds the class isn't understanding something he will spend the extra time needed before moving on. :: He was open to all sorts of questions. I indeed asked many. He encouraged them and after a discussion with him, everything was crystal clear. :: Showing some pictures videos and solving problems. :: By giving us real time applications. :: pretty good. :: He stimulates direct, and pace interaction with the class, encourages independent study, conducts quizzes and surprise extra credit tasks(which keeps us on toe ), uses wit and humor effectively. He knows whether or not the class is following the material and is sensitive to studentsâ motivation and  is concerned about the quality of his/her teaching. :: Yes very well. :: By giving good examples and giving applications of the topic in our day to day life which we are studying. Surprise test are the most amazing part, in which we get bonus points as well as a group discussion chance. :: very simply way but in details. :: He explains things multiple times in different ways to help us learn. :: yes"
2194,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 7330,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- effective. :: Effective. :: Excellent. :: Yes. :: The instructor was highly effective in communicating information both in and out of the classroom setting. :: Dr. Menart did a good job always responding to emails quickly and making himself available for questions from students. :: He gives time both in class and during office hours. :: to the fullest. :: extremely effectively. :: Very well. :: The instructor communicated very effectively both in and out of the classroom. :: 5-star evaluation (strongly agree). :: Excellent. :: Good. :: good. :: Very effectively. :: The best communicator I have seen. Really and sincerely. He has a way of getting everyone involved in the problem. :: Good. :: He is interactive both in and out of the class. :: he communicated very well. :: Very well. He is 24*7 available to clarify our doubts. He had also appointed TA ,whom we could approach to discuss. :: Dr Menart was always there in case of any problems regarding the course. :: Very well. :: wonderful communication both inside and outside the class as like a friend. :: Very well. His communication skills are quite good. :: Very efficient. :: Lectures are online and very easy to access, even if you missed a class."
2195,James Menart,2017 Spring,ME 7330,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes course material flowed from one topic to another and built on previously learned topics well. :: Yes, the course content and lectures were very well organized and the information was significantly easier to follow due to the structure that the lectures were presented in. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: perfectly well organized. :: very well organized, so much helpful information. :: Yes, broken down into topics. :: For the most part, yes. :: Yes, 5-star evaluation (strongly agree). :: Yes. :: Yeah, perfectly organized. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, organization was excellent.  Recording the lectures was also very useful to catch up on lectures that students were able to make it to. :: Extremely well organized. :: Yes it covers almost all the important topics. :: Very well  organized. :: yes they were very well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah they are perfectly organized and prepared. :: superb. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes."

He makes the material very understandable and the course overall is structured very well.  I can't think of any improvements to the course format. :: Yes. I loved this course. It was a privilege. Loved his enthusiasm for the underlying physics and it was contagious. Usually, I breath a sigh of relief when courses are done. This time I am quite a bit disappointed that the course is ending. Also, please know that I am not exaggerating a single bit. He is far better than my opinions suggest. English is my second language, I coukd have put it better in my native language. :: He is very interactive and always helps students in parcipating in the classroom. :: He is a good speaker. His notes are very helpful. Everything perfectly organized. He gives interesting questions in tests. :: Prof James Menart is an energetic, dynamic person, seems to enjoy teaching, conveys a love of the field, has an aura of self-confidence, has a thorough command of the field, gives the student a sense of the field, its past, present, and future directions, the origins of ideas and concepts,  presents facts and concepts from related fields,  discusses viewpoints other than his/her own. He is extremely Student Friendly.. :: Dr. Menart is perfect and one of the best professor Wright State University has. :: outstanding. :: One thing I didn't like about the class is how on exams, we would have to reprove things he did during the notes. In other words, we just do the same thing he did in class. This does nothing to help my understanding of applying the material to solve actual problems. Regurgitating proofs and derivations from the notes on an exam does not help further my understanding of the material. Also, having some stuff on exams that were never even talked about in the notes did not make me happy.. Other than this, I felt the class was very worthwhile of my time. I enjoyed it very much!. :: -. :: He is great."
2198,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: good. :: Dr. Young is a brilliant professor who knows the material well. His line of thinking can be hard to follow at times, but his understanding compensates for it when you question him on the material. :: Very smart but talks way over everyone's head. Exams were fair due to the fact he tells us what we should know from each chapter. He teaches from PowerPoint which is hard to follow. He's very fair at grading and weighting things in the class. Truely wants you to suceed. Homework is almost impossible to complete and there are little to no examples done in class. The book was a complete waste of money for homework and tests. :: Effective, seemed passionate about his topic. :: Great. :: Dr. Dan Young is a little bit goofy, but he genuinely enjoys teaching and seems to want to help students as much as possible. :: good. :: a. :: great professor. :: Probably the most effective teacher at teaching concepts, which made the class interesting and informative. Dr. Young made this class that was a technical elective I was not interested in, very interesting. I took a lot of knowledge I did not expect to take from this class. :: fantastic. :: I think Dr. Young did a great job. I like how he utilized every lecture to the fullest. I live an hour away and value my time in class. Dr. Young delivered the material in a way that was able to be understood from the lecture notes and reading the book. The book had a more detailed way of understanding the material, which made lecture more understandable if the reading was done before class. :: Extremely effective. Not only taught the material well but included relevant bits of knowledge from his personal experiences. :: Very effective. :: He is very cooperative and explain the sibject in a very good manner that student could really understand the complete concept The way he teach things from basic   help the children to learn the things more efficiently. And making learning process more enjoyable."
2199,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: good. :: a. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was very thorough about evaluation and give grades what he thought was deserving.
2200,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, he went over a few times. :: yes. :: yes. :: good. :: a. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Class routinely went until the end of the period but he typically shows up 10 minutes late. :: Yes, did run over a bit which made going to my next class on time difficult. I blame that on the fool who decided to put engineers over in the college of liberal arts not Dr Young though. :: Yes. :: Yes infact he comes a bit early so that students dont have to wait."
2201,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He was very excited to relate the material to manufacturing. The class trip that we took to an actual powder metallurgy processing facility was useful in seeing the process in real life. I wish more instructors took class time to show real examples through class trips. :: Dr. Young is always referencing work he did while he was in school and while he was doing projects as a young engineer to try to give us some insight on what we will be dealing with once we are working in industry. :: good. :: a. :: yes he really did. :: By being energetic and showing a lot of enthusiasm in the subject. :: Dr. Young made a great effort to expose students to powder metallurgy. The plant tour was cool and it seemed like Dr. Young would have done anything to get the students to see an actual facility. To me that shows that he is excited about the topic and wants to open our eyes to more than just a lecture. :: Takes time to answer questions after class, Took the class to a plant tour which was very interesting. :: He helped me alot as this was my first semester he told me how could i cope up with new way of learning as it was all new to me ."
2202,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He is readily available and willing to help outside of class and after class. :: He forgets about emails sometimes but is overall good responding to emails.  In person he is very helpful. :: good. :: everything you need in or out class will get help with him. :: 10/10. :: Responded to emails frequently. I did stop by office hours a few times but there was nobody there :(. :: Very effective. :: Very profeasionly and when needed very friendly and  politely
2203,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes it was a very structured class. :: yes. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Lectures were organized in powerpoint form. Chapters 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 got confusing because the book would lump them together but we had separate chapters in the power points. :: lectures and book did not quite match each other and material covered in homework was occasionally covered in neither. :: Yes, except for the lecture slides that might need a little update. :: Yes"

2205,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4880,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The inclass assignments/lecture notes were good because they helped us understand powder metallurgy but they did not help solve the homework problems. Lecture notes and homework problems were not similar. The tour was a great experience and should be continued in future classes. :: good. :: awesome professor. :: The plant tour was good. It seemed to be a little short. Its always hard with tours because if you aren't in the front its more of a visual tour. Good clean place though. If we could have seen some of the other facilities that would have been a bonus. :: No. :: He helped me alot to get through my first semester the way of teaching is really great."
2206,Henry Young,2017 Spring,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: Instructor made sure that students had all they needed for their projects. Made best effort to answer any questions regarding course or project requirements. :: good. :: okay. :: not great. :: The instructor was very good overall. He had classes and talked about the imperative business that needed to happen but he left the groups a lot of time to work on their projects over the course of the semester. The individual group meeting that we had with him were also very productive. Sometimes though it seemed that he was a little on the unorganized size. :: great. :: Fine. :: He is really good instructor at Wright State. He is knowledgeable and helpful. :: Dr. Young didn't try to delude us into thinking all senior design projects are supposed to have earth-shattering results.  He made it obvious that some go well and have a lot of cool outcomes and some go poorly and are pretty boring.  Straightforward guy and very helpful along the way. :: good. :: Excellent!. :: Well, great if I pass and graduate. :: Gave good advice and helped keep us on track. :: Very. :: Henry Young was an effective professor that had reasonable requirements and was available for consultation. :: great professor. :: 10/10. :: make this form stop popping up every time i log into pilot. :: Very helpful and always responds to email. :: Somewhat Effective. :: Good job bro"

This is Capstone Design course and typically requires hands on activities. :: Individual team meetings were very helpful. :: The guest speakers were pretty boring and repetitive, but he wanted us to have information that might save us when we are working as professional engineers, so I can't blame him for that. :: great. :: Very interested lectures. :: By not paying attention to emails and presentations.. wait, that demonstrates disinterest.. :: Held meetings every few weeks to discuss our projects. :: Would ask questions of the students, and would get involved in projects beyond what was called by the class (when asked to do so). :: yes. :: By sharing his professional experience and continually mentoring the class. He encouraged us to learn how to conduct ourselves in a professional atmosphere by example and instruction. :: By being involved in the students. :: He was excited about our projects and wanted to know status but often would not give feedback on papers or presentations. :: He effectively used the english language to relay his knowledge and I was able to receive due to my reciprocal understanding of the english language."

He also was not always prompt with emails sometimes. :: well. :: Yes. :: He is perfect for communication.

I was hoping for more feedback and interest in reports and presentations to prepare us better for the real world. Also due dates were never kept and schedule details were last minute. :: I feel a common Capstone project similar to the EE or CE departments would ensure a well thought out project for students; or projects with competitions because there is a defined goal with expectations.

The only point in going to class was that attendance was mandatory and that it was  a very large portion of your final grade, Other than that I felt that the class was just a waste of time and could be used to do homework for other classes because the material taught was pointless. :: Boring, almost put me to sleep most classes. :: effective enough. did not make the class enjoyable. :: He is interested in teaching and helping you learn, and is very good at answering any questions you have in class. :: The man is very smart.

Everyone has ""tried"" to learn, but from everyone in my group and in the class that I've talked to, they are clueless on most of the material for this course.

2216,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes used the full time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yeah. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he started class consistently on time and used the whole time. :: Yes. :: Always. :: If using an hour of class to make sure clickers are registered and working every class, and then leaving the rest of the class to us to work on problems by ourselves is considered using the full period then yes. :: Always arrived early to class and would answer questions both before and after class as well."
2217,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Passionate about what he teaches. :: Yes he really seemed interested that we learned the subject. :: yes. :: Yes. :: very helpful when asked questions; always wanting to help. :: email and office hours. :: He kind of like pestered us like high school students to do work. It was really annoying to be honest, and it even had the opposite affect most of the time. :: didnt. :: He always came up to our table and asked if we had any questions, and whenever we were doing a problem, he would come over and offer his suggestions. :: Because of the class style, learning is heavily dependent upon the student; however, the instructor was willing to answer any questions and work with students to help their understanding. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Going over the uses for the materials and how they were made kept things interesting."
2218,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good. :: Pretty well. :: very effectivally. :: Very effectively. :: good in class; n/a outside. :: very. :: well. :: He didn't, did he?. :: effectively enough. :: He was very effective with emails, and with his small lectures in class. :: Sent out emails when necessary. :: Dr. Srinivasan did a great job communicating inside and outside of the classroom via emails and pilot. :: Yes. :: Very well at both. :: If I had concerns the teacher or a T.A. would get back to me in a reasonable amount of time."
2219,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes they were. :: fairly. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Nooooooo, I was lost most of the time, his lectures are essentially over the reading done the night before, but he will start the lecture going over it, but then go off on tangents often. Confused me on quizzes from information that was used, or just tangential information he just said. :: yes. :: The classes were well organized, but for me personally, the set up of interactive classes does not work very well, as it is more of a teach-yourself the material kind of environment where the professor is there more so to clear things up and for short lectures. This sometimes makes it difficult to actually learn the material correctly. :: Somewhat. Perusall, in my opinion, is a good idea but not effective. Online textbooks are just a bad idea in general. :: Yes, Dr. Srinivasan had well organized lectures and course content all on the pilot website. :: Yes. :: To some degree due to the class format. :: No, annotations were a nightmare. Our grades never got inputted on time and we would never know if we needed to use the grace period or not to improve our grades. :: I think that they were about as organized as could be hoped for."
2220,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I didn't really try. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Before the semester started I emailed Dr. Srinivasan and he emailed me later that night. :: Yes. :: I'm not sure. :: For the most part if I needed help I would talk to one of the T.A.s at the extra section for the class."
2221,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- nope. :: The set up of the class is a little odd. I am not the biggest fan of active learning. :: Everything involving the annotation homework on perusall was unpleasant and made me lose interest in the course. :: no. :: good teacher. :: I was going to put song lyrics here to relay my feelings in that way about the class, but honestly I can't think of a good song to show my feelings on it. It was just boring and not really informative. :: the perusall annotation software is a joke. :: No. :: The instructor knows what he is doing. But the class methodology is not very good. Perusall is too easy to cheat. Too many people just copied the first definition of a word from Wikipedia and pasted it in the text. Sometimes multiple people highlighted the same word and pasted the exact same definition. It shows exactly how much effort they put into the class. I haven't seen their grades, but I bet they got A's on all their Perusall assignments while I was actually putting in effort to get B's and C's.  Because of Perusall being easy to cheat and the quizzes being simple, I feel like we didn't learn anything.  My recommendation is to change the class to a physical book and doing more traditional classroom work. :: Nope. :: No. :: No. :: I do not like the ""step-up"" learning method. I feel more comfortable with traditional styles of teaching, like doing examples and students asking questions. To me step-up education felt a lot like taking an online course. You are basically 100% on your own with the material. The instructor does little to no lecture, you just read the textbook and do assignments. I once asked for assistance or to see an example and I was told that there are examples in the book (no help help or explanation was provided). The student to professor ratio is way off in these courses. I feel as though Wright State will move to more of this style of classroom due to their financial troubles, which is a shame for the students. We are not receiving a quality education for what we are paying by providing us with this. Sure, I am getting an easy passing grade in the class because it has been dumbed down due to the style of teaching, but I am actually learning nothing. Which is kind of scary when you are pumping out graduating classes every year of engineers who have not been taught everything properly. We will not be taking a final exam in this course thankfully because the entire class would fail it, but I would be interested to see just how bad the scores would be if there were a final exam. You could check the effectiveness of step-up education by giving us a final or pop-quiz at the end of the semester."
2222,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Late on grading some stuff, but otherwise good. :: well spoken. :: The instructor was very knowledgable in the two different subjects. He knew how to present the material so that fairly understandable. :: Good Course. :: good. :: Interesting subject and classes. Very effective. :: I had Dr. Srinivasan for my most effective undergraduate course.  In spite of this course schedule conflicting with my job I wanted to take another course with him.  In my experience, he works with average students and challenges great students to learn beyond the base curriculum.  He also assisted me in finding a research project by speaking with his colleagues."
2223,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: All the work was evaluated fair grading scale that was outlined by the instructor. :: Yes of course. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Thus far my course evaluations have been fair, as you would hope.  The syllabus was clear and only the schedule changed to suit a format including materials selection."
2224,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: The class was started on time and he used as much time as he needed to finish the lecture slides for the day. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I never had an issue where Dr. Srinivasan was not prompt.
2225,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Real life examples. :: materials. :: He made sure to answer all questions posed and he gave homework that covered what we had talked about. :: i learned a new software. :: good. theough live examples projects. etc. :: Always available to answer questions. :: He helped me and the University beyond this course when I expressed interest in research.  Dr. S and Dr. Klingbeil are the greatest educational influences I have encountered.  It's not close.  My commendation, from my perspective cannot be overstated as these gentlemen truly propelled my education and love of the University."
2226,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Not much help was given when confused on homework or quizes. Example problems would have helped a lot, especially during the material selection portion of the class. :: good. :: email. :: The instructor made things fairly clear and was clear about what he wanted done for homework. :: Professor explained every topic clearly. :: good. :: Very effective. :: Absolutely effectively.  I did not perceive any gap in communication"
2227,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: good. :: yes. :: They seemed to be a little scattered sometimes and did not always have a flow or specific path they were taking. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes.  In a different course structure from the previous, I was challenged to learn."
2228,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: good. :: yes. :: The instructor was always available during these times. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2229,Raghavan Srinivasan,2017 Spring,ME 4740,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- More in class problems similar to exam questions would have been helpful. :: no. :: The lecture slides sometimes seemed to not have a flowing path. Tests for the failure analysis section also seemed to be extremely specific whereas the lecture slides did not go into that much detail. :: Nothing to comment about professor. :: no. :: No. :: I was so profoundly affected by Dr. Srinivasan's teaching that I sought this course six years after he taught me in a senior elective during my undergraduate program.  His ability to challenge good students to learn beyond the curriculum has forever affected my career (with five years of work experience since my senior coursework)."
2230,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Amer is very effective overall. :: The professor did a great job of explaining the subject. He provided good examples and information in an organized manner. The professor covered a lot of information in an organized fashion. :: Best Professor I have had in my 4 years here at Wright State! Incredible professor and extremely knowledgeable. I've never learned so much in a semester before! Professor Amer is one to keep and I am excited to take classes with him in the future, if he is teaching the nanotechnology class next spring I will for sure take it. :: Amazing. :: effective. :: Presented the material for this course very well. :: GREAT INSTUCTOR. :: taught clearly and very well. :: Hard to understand but not bad. :: Great course. :: Good. :: Taught us how to do the problems by giving examples and explaining where the formulas came from. :: Short, concise, and effective. :: Dr. Amer was very enjoyable and keen.  He constantly asked for questions from the class to ensure that everyone was following and made the lessons palatable and down-to-Earth. :: For the most part I think he was effective. There was a couple of times where I was not sure of things going on but was able to get through it. :: Dr. Amer was very effective in the instruction of Thermodynamics. :: By far one of my favorite professors at wright state. Everything from the beginning was well defined and very clear and he achieved his goal by having me love thermodynamics. This was the class i probably learned the most in and its very useful stuff and would also lighten the mood every once in a while. Explained things well and would always make sure everyone understood before moving on. Would take again in a heartbeat!!!. :: He taught the material very well! But referred to the book a lot to remember the material. :: not effective what so ever. very sloppy handwritting and could never really follow lecture notes. did not learn much from lectures and i attended every class. :: Very effective and knowledgable. :: good. :: Dr. Amer is a very effective instructor. He is passionate about the material, which makes it easy to understand because he knows multiple ways in how to present and solve a problem. He cares about students and making sure that we understand the material we are learning and it applies to real and everyday life and situations. Professor Amer went beyond the basic teaching status to show how important this material is and we as people. :: This instructor did an excellent job of teaching the material and helping the class to understand. :: I learned a lot from him, including things that weren't part of the syllabus. :: Very effective, made the subject very interesting. :: Awesome- I came into the semester dreading this subject the most, but Dr. Amer made the material relatable in a step by step method that I really appreciate. :: Very effective. I always felt like I understood the concepts and could do the problems. :: The teacher teaches the class a bit differently than the other teachers, but taught it very well. He focused a lot of the lecture on the concept of what we were learning, so when an example came the student more easily understood what was going on in the problem, The equations were not super clear for the problem but that was on the student to decide. Overall he taught the course very well. :: Somewhat effective. His class is basically just doing example problems in class. :: Dr. Amer was very effective in his teaching. :: Somewhat Effective. :: Very effective professor. Made me interested in the subject being taught. :: Very effective. :: I respect the professor, his examples are well taught, I learned from him many different things. :: Very effective. :: very effective. i really enjoy his teaching style and he is more than fair. he made the course enjoyable and applied it to life. :: Pretty effective. :: He explained material well with good organization. :: Maher Amer was really effective on the subject thermodynamics. He really made me feel like I wanted to learn more about thermodynamics."
2231,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: The course syllabus was vague, however, the professor was clear about his expectations for the class. He evaluated his students exactly like he described. :: Yes, he is extremely clear when it comes to expectations. There were no surprises whatsoever. Professor Amer was a very fair grader. :: Absolutely. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Good. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes, he is. :: Dr. Amer did grade work based on what was presented in the syllabus. He was straightforward with grading and how grades were given. He was upfront on assignments and how crucial they are to the overall grade. :: Yes, the syllabus was followed accurately and grading was consistent. :: Yes. :: Yes, expectations were clearly laid out. :: yes. :: Yes, he evaluated exactly how he claimed he would. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Kind of. :: Yes, syllabus was fairly bare, but all aspects were followed. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Maher Amer evaluated my work and expectations was all described in the course syllabus."
2232,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Routinely cut class off 20 minutes short to smoke. :: The instructor started class on time each day and utilized time as it was needed. He did not hold students in the classroom for an unnecessary amount of time. :: He started class on time and would explain what would be covered in the lecture, we always covered everything he initially set out to cover. He would end lecture when he finished covering all of the information for that day then would always ask if we had any questions. Quality over quantity. :: Very punctucual. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Good. :: Always started on time and usually used the entire class time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: There was a time or two he would be late by a minute or so but for the most part he started class on time. :: Dr. Amer always started class on time. He would ask ""How is everyone doing?""..at the very second class was to begin.  There were a few times the full class period wasn't used, but the class covered all of the material we were supposed to. Of course, we could have stayed longer if we had any questions about the material we went over. :: Yes, he did. :: no, ended early a lot and ended the whole class over a week early as well. could have had those extra days all as review sessions. :: yes. :: yes. :: Dr. Amer did start class promptly at the time we were suppose to start. Most times he used close to the full class period. Some days, if he finished the material early, we were released early. :: Yes, class always met on time and for the entirety of the scheduled class time. :: We let out early occasionally, but time in class was effectively used. :: Class often began on time, and sometimes let out a little early. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The instructor started the class on time and would use as much time as he needed to get through his desired material, as a result we sometimes got out a little bit early. :: He always started class on time, but he routinely ended class at least 30-45 minutes early. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, at times we ended class early, but it wasn't often. :: Yes. :: YESSS. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Always started on time. :: Yes sometimes ended early, but the material was still taught. :: Maher Amer always started the class on time and sometimes he would let us out early but that help us to understand the current chapters without diving into more material. I feel what Maher Amer did was to not overload us with information."
2233,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He did not, besides calling people out who were distracted during class. :: The instructor encouraged questions and seemed to want to help the students have success in his class. :: He is one of the few professor that applies an real world application to the topic being discussed, this made it easier to understand and remember. I wished more instructors were like professor Amer, he makes learning thermodynamics something to be excited about. :: Made many opportunities to ask questions and answered effectively. :: yes. :: By giving examples of real life uses that this course is applicable to. :: involvement. :: yes, very much so. :: Good. :: yes. :: Genuine interest. :: Dr. Amer often told small stories related to Thermodynamics to make the subject more interesting.  He applied Thermodynamic theories to everyday situations to further solidify the ideas we were learning. :: He would call on students in class to make sure that they were paying attention. He would tell students that they need to get off of their phones because he cared about them and I believe he did. :: Dr. Amer would always ask if we had any questions after EVERY problem that we went through as a class. If you did not understand something, he was happy to help. To further help us understand the topics in Thermodynamics, he would relate the material to real world situations. :: Yes, he did.  I enjoyed how he provided real life examples to the problems we did in class. It made the topics less confusing to learn. :: i guess. :: By being passionate about his subject. :: good. :: Dr. Amer showed an interest in my learning because he made connections to things I already knew about and see in everyday life. He didn't allow the material to be limited just in a classroom with notes and what the textbook says. He made the material easily recognizable and to connect to. :: He answered all the questions we had, and often probed us to ask more, which was good. :: He was very engaging and encouraged questions. :: yes. :: He asked for questions repeatedly to make sure no one was lost in lecture, as well as go over the quiz. :: answered any and all emails back or in person, and answered questions in class. :: He would answer any questions that we had to the best of his ability, for the most part. :: Dr. Amer demonstrated high interest in my learning by providing office hours, as well as keeping everyone engaged in lectures. :: Did not really care. :: Professor showed care with each student whenever they asked him questions and showed interest in the subject. :: Stayed to answer questions after ckass. :: giving us a real examples that we do in our life. :: Wanted us to really put our best effort into the course. :: said he wanted us to love the class by the end of the semester. :: Yes, related real life topics and experiences to the material to better our learning. :: He gave good many examples of problems with visuals. :: Explaining the course and the material in an interesting way to help us understand the material more in depth."
2234,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Well. Expectations were always clear and he did a good job of explaining the material. :: The professor seemed to not like emails. He seemed to discourage ""bothering him"" with questions over email. In class he would talk about sending ""pointless"" emails, which deterred me from trying to communicate with him out of the classroom. He did not seem open to extra communication out of the classroom. :: Very responsive within reason, if you emailed him a question regarding something stated in lecture he wouldn't respond. I know because he would describe his hilarious emails that he got and share them with the class, he always kept the students anonymous though. If you asked a reasonable question he would explain and answer it clearly, and in a timely manner. :: Very Effectively. :: well. :: Very effective. :: great. :: very effectively. :: Good. :: communicated well. :: Very well. :: Very, very well. :: In the classroom I think he communicated well. I never know about outside of class. :: Communication with this instructor is great. He is very helpful inside and outside of the classroom. One-on-one help was fantastic during office hours. :: He DID NOT like to receive emails!! He would call out the students that sent him emails to complain about them.  So, not the best to communicate with!. :: not effective, ignored students emails, when he was emailed and read them he would come to class and point that student out in front of the class and make it clear how stupid their email was and that he should not recieve and emails like that again. :: effectively. :: ten out of ten. :: Dr. Amer always started class with announcements, if there were any that day. He emailed the class as needed if there was something that needed to be clarified or changed. :: I would have liked a little clearer communication about if and when assignments were going on Pilot, but most things went pretty smoothly. :: He was very effective with communication. :: A very good communicator: able to relate complicated topics in easy to understand ways!. :: Fairly effectively. There were times when I was unsure of what was due or if there was a quiz or not, but otherwise he communicated well. :: well. :: He never answered emails and he would call you out in front of the class if you emailed him about any questions. Other than that, he was decent. :: Dr. Amer was very effective with communicating to the class. :: Not very. :: Very effective. no-nonsense teacher who was direct and concise with his lectures. He provided great examples for understanding as well. :: Very effectively. :: very nicee. :: Well. :: very effectively. :: Very well. :: He communicated well. :: He was very effective whether there was any concern or encouragement to the classroom if needed."
2235,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: The course's content was well organized. The instructor followed the chapters in the book and explained information in an organized manner. :: Very much so! :). :: Yes, notes then examples. Great way to structure a class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: of coarse. :: almost always. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the requirements and expectations were clearly listed and taught in a particular order. :: I believe so. It went in an order that we were able to understand and accomplish. He was able to time everything out very well. :: Yes. :: For the most part, yes. :: no. not at all. :: yes. :: well organized. :: Dr. Amer had his pilot organized very simple and easy, which is very nice. Lecture was well organized by doing announcements, notes and problems, and then reiterating what was covered in class and the objectives of the material we just learned. :: The instructors handwriting was a bit hard to read at times, and the instructor spoke a bit quietly, but after some quick adjustments on my part it was not a problem. :: Yes. :: Yes, lectures were very organized. :: nice and straight forward. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Yes, All content was posted outside of class notes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, however notes could have been more organized. :: Yes, the content and lectures was well organized."
2236,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: I never tried to contact the professor through any of these means. However, he was good at keeping the class updated by sending out emails when class was cancelled. However, he was not good at telling the students when homework and quizzes would be uploaded to pilot. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: hell yea. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Amer either answered questions in class or responded to email very quickly. :: If I would have went then I believe he would have been. He really did not like emails though. :: Yes. Dr. Amer responds to as many emails as he possibly can. :: I do not remember him offering, or providing office hours. :: no. :: yes. :: yes. :: Dr. Amer did hold office hours and was responsive to anything online in a timely manner. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was available. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Somewhat. :: Yes, I never contacted him out of class, but he was readily available for any questions I had. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Maher Amer always respond to any email whether it was in email or to address the whole classroom if he thought it was important enough."
2237,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Amer called people out during class in two instances that I noticed he should not have. He stopped during lecture to ask someone if they were registered with ODS. He also called me out for taking a make-up exam in front of the class, knowing that I had undergone a traumatic experience that caused me to need to make it up. He was contacted through Student Support Services. :: The professor did well in instructing the class. However, I hope in the future he is more open to emails and willing to be more open about expectations for exams. In doing so, students would be capable of studying more effectively for the topics on the exams. :: AWESOME!! PROFESSOR AMER IS THE BEST!. :: Amazing professor and I hope to take more courses with him!. :: no. :: Enjoyed being in this class and would take this instructor again. :: HE IS FUNNY AF. :: My only suggestion is to have more quizzes. If a student were to get 2 or 3 of the large point quizzes wrong, it becomes impossible to get the required 60% minimum average for the quiz section. Because most of the 10 quizzes are 5 or 10 points, messing up one 50 point quiz would give you the same score as a student that just chose not to do 5 of the smaller ones. Which does not really seem fair. When each quiz took about equal amounts of time and effort to complete. :: Great professor, very practical. :: I was only disappointed with the class during the Final for two reasons: one, that the formula sheet provided was not very useful, and two that 50/100 points of the exam were in a question that (to my knowledge) was never covered by the homework.   All the questions needed at least one formula that was not on the formula sheet.  Having a formula sheet suggests that students can focus on studying theory, but on the final this was not the case.  I have done very well in this class up to that point.  I feel like my abilities on the final were not properly assessed, and that being able to properly use a given formula is more important than whether or not you bet on memorizing the correct formulas.  I, apparently, did not 'bet' on having formulas like Polytropic Work at the ready for the final. I'm not trying to place the blame on Dr. Amer, nor am I insinuating that he attempted to ""pull a fast one"" on the class.  From a student perspective, however, I felt unprepared for the final for silly reasons instead of lack of study. :: I think he is a little intimidating in class. The way he would answers would come off as mean. It hindered me from asking questions a time or two. He always welcomed questions though. :: Dr. Amer not only instructed me on the material of Thermodynamics, he also showed me that I LOVE the subject. I hope I have the opportunity to take more of his classes in the future. :: I would take another class with him.  But hopefully he will get better on responding to emails, and office hours!. :: bad, boring class, hanging on by a thread. :: no. :: Great instructor. Very fair, would take a class with him again. :: No. :: I love Thermodynamics. :: my favorite instructor in the entire university by far. the only negative thing i would have to say is that when it is test time he says he wants you to study everything for the test but he doesnt put everything on the tests. when the tests only have 3 questions and you really mess one up you get a bad grade. :: Good instructor"
2238,Maher Amer,2017 Spring,ME 7720,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: make this form stop popping up every time i log into pilot. :: Dr.Amer is a very effective instructor, I get a lot of information from his class. :: Very effective in conveying his knowledge. :: He is my perfect professor . He is not only a professor, indeed he is a school that you can learn too many things from his huge experience and knowledge. :: Dr Amer is a very fair and attentive instructor."

He was always very clear in communication both in and out of the classroom. :: Very effectively. Really appreciated the matlab code examples that helped visualize the optimization algorithms. :: Very effectively. :: very effective. :: Professor communicate excellent both in class as well as on emails and during office hours. He was always available to help when student has any problem. :: -Instructor communicated well in class as well as during office hours. :: Very well.  See previous response. :: He was amazing and never hesitated to spend time clearing the doubts even after the official hours. :: Great
2283,Joshua Deaton,2017 Spring,ME 7080,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Extremely well organized lectures and posted notes. Without the notes he posted online, I would fail the class. :: Yes. :: Lectures were very well organized. The course content was ordered very logically. Each topic built on the previous. The supplementary information posted on pilot was very helpful in understanding the course content. :: Yes. :: Yes, they were. :: Yes. :: Yes, course content and lecture was well organized and was in a sequential pattern. :: -Yes the content and lectures were well organized. :: Very well organized.  It was apparent that Professor Deaton had a plan for each lecture because he would politely respond to student questions that the answer would become apparent alter in the lecture. :: Yes. :: Greatly yes"
2284,Joshua Deaton,2017 Spring,ME 7080,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Josh always responded to emails very promptly and was readily available during his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was. :: Yes. :: Yes, instructor was available during office hours and always replied to emails and was always happy to help when student needs help. :: -Yes instructor was available during office hours as well as was responsive on line. :: Yes. :: Yes he was , a good listener. :: Greatly yes"
2285,Joshua Deaton,2017 Spring,ME 7080,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I think the material is very interesting even while difficult. My hindrance in this class is my coding ability. There's no real way to get around that except if more Matlab courses were taught to undergrads; maybe one each year?. :: No. :: Josh does a fantastic job as an instructor. He is very clear in his explanations of complex topics. This has easily been one of my favorite classes that I have taken at WSU. :: He is an excellent instructor. Couldn't ask for more. :: -Overall the teaching was really very good and I learnt many things from this instructor under this subject. :: I would want to take another subject under him. :: No"
2286,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Gobal did well. I believe this was his first class and it seems that he did a good job in covering useful subject matter and making his exams look like what he taught. Some professors do not have this skill.. Kinematics is an interesting subject and he did a good job to keep it that way. :: All the information was there.. IF you could keep up. :: Decent to good effectiveness. Some topics were vague/confusing. :: did not seem too interested in teaching the subject. :: Very clear that he is a new professor. His ability to explain things could use improvement. :: Pretty effective. :: God awful. The worst overall class ive taken at wright state. Professor talked extremely quiet and did not explain material. The final class project was extremely vague and could essentially be boiled down to ""design something"". Asked multiple times about what specifically needed to be in report and still got no real answers and the professor would routinely change what he said the next time i answered. Horrible professor horrible class. i would wish this class on my worst enemies. :: Very effective. :: He just got his PhD, so he was new. Much of the homework was too difficult and I didn't get much out of it. Because I didn't do well on the homework, I still had trouble when it came time for exams. The reviews before the exams were very useful however. :: Too difficult- hard to learn. :: A good instructor. It's my understanding that this is his first semester teaching. I think he did okay for it being his first time. After a few more semesters he'll be very good. :: Dr. Gobal spent a lot of time on graphical methods that are impractical and useless. I understand it was his first time teaching the course, however, he should consider teaching the material that we can actually use. This is especially true considering Kinematics is an elective course. :: The book taught me better than he did, and all he did was read parts of the book aloud. :: Professor was good at explaining the subject but the examples explained in the class weren't sufficient to solve the homework. Questions from the comparatively tough to what we have learned in the class. Need more hard work of students to get average score in the exams. The time provided was not sufficient for solving the type of questions given. :: teaching method is good, proper planning for every classes, make revision of all topic after end of the chapter. finally, he has given his good effort to teach his subject. :: Dr. Gobal is very helpful. His teaching methodology is extremely well organized. He explains every topic followed by an example, which gives proper understanding of that topic. :: Dr. Gobal taught the course very well. He taught all the topics in an effective manner which was very understandable and clarified the doubts raised which made the understanding of the subject even more easier which was very helpful."
2287,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, but exam expectations were not always very clear. :: Not really. Student expectations are greatly over the top. All of the matlab he expected us to be able to do was ridiculous. :: Yes. :: Not really. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes, the expectations listed in the syllabus were well defined. The homework, however, seemed like busy work. We were assigned 4 programming assignments a week over the same material. One should have been sufficient considering the material is the same. :: Not at all. :: When it comes to exam evaluation the instructor reduced marks even for a slightest mistake. :: yes but he would have  done more practice of tough examples to us which he asked in exam. :: Dr. Gobal is consistent in evaluating the work done by students. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor gave a very good course work which covered all the  major parts of the topic  which was descried in the course syllabus which made us gain perfection in all topics throughout the entire course syllabus."
2288,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yeah. :: Yes always. :: Usually used full class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he only released the class early once (~10 min). :: No, he always started early which mean it hard for those of us who had class right before on the other side of campus make it to lecture in 3 minutes to not miss any of the lecture. :: Yes, The instructor was punctual for every class and he also uses full class time effectively with prior planning. :: yes, he did. :: Yes, Dr. Gobal always start class on time and use the full class period. :: Yes, Dr. Gobal took use of full class period and did a very effective use of time and taught all the topics and made us understand those topics and clarified all doubts which were raised."
2289,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He took the time to answer my questions. :: Yes, but I felt like sometimes the topics weren't explained enough in detail. :: Not really. :: Encouraged us to ask questions in class if we were ever confused. :: Nope. :: The instructor was very open to questions. :: He was available after class and office hours and would explain things I did not understand. :: I have had hrad time to understand. :: He made sure to stop so that we could ask questions, and periodically check that we were following along. He also posted lots of helpful material to Pilot. :: Yes, he always asked the class if we had any questions. I think it would have been more useful had he assigned the same project to the entire class so that the grading could be more objective. It seems like the project is more of a grade buffer and not meaningful. :: Not at all. He was impersonal and could care less. :: He always asks students for any doubt clarifications after each topic and he explains it to all the students so that all students with the same doubt can understand. :: he has given us project, which was based on to design a real world problem with improvement on it, so, he has demonstrate interest through it. :: I used to meet Dr. Gobal on regular basis to solve my difficulties. Since then he started taking interest in my learning. :: Dr. Gobal taught the subject in a well manner which made the subject interesting and he taught all the topics well and gave various examples to those topics both in classwork and homework which made us understand the topic even more easily. For further better understanding of the course he gave a project in this course while demonstrating the project it gave even more interest in the course."
2290,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Great, I was most impressed with how quickly he would answer email responses. This is extremely helpful when you can't make it on campus but still, have a question. He was reachable at pretty much all working hours as well as the weekend. :: Sometimes it was a little rough. He'd blaze through a method and I'd be stuck 6 lines back trying to figure out what some operation was, he'd ask ""questions?"" (no responses, everyone still scribbling and staring at the board) ""good."" (moves on). But like I said, once I got my questions formulated he did a great job of making sure I got straightened out. Always verified that my concerns were alleviated. :: He tried hard to ensure that we all understood the topics covered but sometimes his explanations didn't help and created more confusion when asked about it. :: never communicated with him. :: Decently. :: Pretty effective. :: Terribly. :: Very effectively. :: He was available after class and office hours and would explain things I did not understand. :: 80%. :: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say he was about a 5 or 6 in effectiveness of communication of the material. I think it's possible that the course topic on its own is already extremely challenging to convey compared to other subjects like mech design or thermodynamics. If he were teaching it different course it's a possibility that I'd rate him higher. :: Dr. Gobal communicates well in and outside of the classroom. :: The instructor is so friendly and he is always ready to help students in and out of the class. :: he communicated very politely and every time he helped me to solve my problems related subject. :: Dr. Gobal replies to all the queries in and out of class and sometimes he gives suggestions on what should be done. He treats every student equally. :: Dr. Gobal clarified all the doubts in any part of the topic. He gave all the answers were well whenever a doubt was raised even during out of class he used to clarify all those doubts raised in the classwork or homework in his office as well."
2291,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, he had organized notes to follow and would post them online after class. This was extremely useful. :: Yes, I'd say so. The notes were a little incomplete at times, but nothing unmanageable with a bit of bookwork. :: Yes. :: not really. :: The were kind of all over the place and sporadic. :: Yes. :: Not at all. :: The notes and lectures were extremely organized and neat. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes. Although, I'd like it if it was a little more explicit on what chapters of the book we were working out of. :: Yes, he basically followed the book. :: Yes, contents were well organized for a good understanding of the subject. The sequence of lectures follows the previous lecture which helps to familiarize with the new topic.The. :: yeah, it has gone step by step. :: The course content and lectures were very well organized. :: Yes, Dr. Gobal efficiently covered all topics in time. He taught all the topics in a very understandable way. He took maximum use of the class period and organised a well lecture of each and every topic in the course."
2292,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- This was his best attribute in teaching the class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: never attempted. :: Yeah. :: Yes. :: Available? Yes. Helpful? No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor is responsive in all types of needs of students regarding the subject. He also waits after class to clarify students with doubts in that lecture. :: yes, all the time which you have mentioned in questions, he had given me positive  feedback. :: Yes! Dr. Gobal was always available and responsive during and after office hours. :: Yes, Dr. Gobal was frequently available in his office hours and replied to all the mails frequently."
2293,Koorosh Gobal,2017 Spring,ME 4250,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- My only issue is that the homework seemed impossible at times. The homework was HEAVILY Matlab based and many students spent more time trying to learn more advanced Matlab than actually trying to learn the subject. This made it difficult when trying to use homework to prepare for exams. I would expect the homework grades to be relatively low compared to exam grades in this class. :: I enjoyed your class Dr Gobal! Sorry I wasn't a better student! I really do feel like I learned a lot about kinematics, even though I had looks of confusion, worry, and panic on my face most of the time in lecture. :: Good teacher for the most part. I just felt like some topics weren't covered in the best way. He did plenty of examples but cut out some steps that should be known. It's nice to see each step and how he gets the answers instead of the current method. :: does not  write very clear on board. :: Horrible Horrible Horrible. :: This class would have been much easier if the homework was easier and if we had more examples during lecture. Homework would have been better if we had more problems but each problem took less time. :: Yes exam should be take home  The course is too hard. :: I think Dr. Gobal did well considering this was his first time teaching. I hope Wright State decides to keep him around. :: The instructors needs to provide more and complicated examples related to the topics for good understanding. The time should be provided to complete the exam based on the question paper. :: Nope, that,s all for him. :: Dr. Gobal is always ready to help each and every student in class and he is very supportive."
2294,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Camberos is a really nice guy who really knows his stuff. But I think class time was poorly managed. :: Understands the topic to an amazing extent, and is capable of teaching it to the students. However, understanding his teaching style can be difficult if you don't prepare yourself prior to his lectures. :: effective. :: Good. :: See last section."
2295,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, he was even lenient when need be for certain topics that were discussed during the course, depending on how well the students were understanding how to apply what was being taught. :: yes. :: yes. :: See last section."
2296,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, and we were 'requested' to attend an additional class on Friday from 4:40 pm to 6:00 pm and he would routinely cancel the Monday or Wednesday class at his convenience. Basically making the Friday class mandatory if you wanted to learn the material. Overall, I think it was inconsiderate of us. :: No, but working in research, he would find time to make-up the class sections that were not capable of being taught. Usually, carrying classes over to an ""added"" Friday section. :: yes. :: yes. :: If he didn't start early or get a speeding ticket. :: See last section."
2297,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Always asking for class input, making sure we were understanding what was being told to us. :: interesting materials. :: In depth homework. :: See last section."
2298,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very connected to the students, either through emails, in the classroom, or even with texting. :: effective. :: Effective. :: See last section."
2299,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Ehhh, I'd say that they were. Most of the time, he was just going in chronological order on how the topics play into each other. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not really. He would say important information but it wouldn't be in the slides and therefore looking at the slides for reference did not help. :: See last section."
2300,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, very much so. No office hours, but he did answer emails and texts. :: yes. :: See last section."
2301,Jose Camberos,2017 Spring,ME 7340,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Overall Dr. Camberos is highly knowledgeable in the field of CFD. However, I don't think his expectations of Wright State Students are where they should be. This one of our highest level thermal-fluids classes. In the final two weeks, we arrived at the equations of fluid mechanics. By comparison, other universities are there at week 4. Maybe this isn't a problem with Dr. Camberos' teaching style though. The department could easily speed this class up by making the advanced engineering math class a prerequisite. Finite differences and PDEs are covered in great detail the math class. It is a waste of Dr. Comberos's time and ours to cover PDE solutions and simple finite differences. Of course, these techniques applied to the equations of fluid mechanics should be covered in great detail. Aside from making an additional class period, I enjoyed Dr. Camberos' class. But I really think the ME department should consider restructuring the CFD class to be more in line with other universities. :: No. :: no. :: No. :: Recombine the first two homework assignments. This may help to get through all the material. Also give the intro to the project at least a month before it is due, when you only give a week, it is just a huge homework assignment and students cannot budget time to do it well so close to the end of the semester when everything else is occurring, i.e., other class projects, thesis defenses, etc. :: As a precursor to the following statements, I had no CFD knowledge prior to this course.  My fluids knowledge was limited to undergraduate Fluid Mechanics. Several improvements can be made to the structure of this course that would benefit the students.  A signficant amount of time was spent on finite difference theory.  The class spent quite a while on deriving finite differences.  Including how to derive the finite difference equation from a Taylor Series Expansion and how the finite difference can be used to discretize the governing PDEs.  This could be condensed into half-a-class (40 minute) review.  This should be covered in the pre-reqs, and is covered in other classes as well.  I did not have all the pre-reqs for the class, but I have taken EGR-7030 and MTH-6050. â¢	EGR-7030: Covers during the finite difference equations and the use of various numerical methods (i.e. Runge-Kutta). â¢	MTH-6050: Covers the analytical solution of PDEs using Fourier series and introduces solving PDEs numerically using the finite difference methods.  Also teaches the Crank-Nicolson method for Laplace equations. Stability analysis is not covered in these classes, so that should be kept in the class.  This is relatively simple and should be able to be taught in one class period. The more advanced finite difference methods (i.e. DuFort-Frankel, Lax-Friedrich, Lax-Wendroff) should still be covered as they are not covered in the other classes.  However, with the pre-req knowledge students should be able to easily understand how the equation was discretized, how it was modified after discretization (i.e. let u_j = 0.5*[u_j+1 + u_j-1]).  The majority of the time on these equations can spent on showing that the modifications lead to favorable stability characterisitics. All of the above should be able to be accomplished fairly quickly.  The application of these methods should be demonstrated in class. It would be helpful to the class if these methods were coded up by the instructor during class and the class could follow along since we were in a computer lab.  This could be accomplished quickly for a simple 1D example. A much greater amount of time needs to be dedicated to the finite volume methodology.  In the course this semester, finite difference was hammered hard (too hard) and finite volume was very very breifly touched on and then was not covered again until the last two weeks of class when it was time to start working on the project.   Instead, after finite difference is covered (relatively quickly) for 1D problems the finite volume method needs introduced.  The FVM process needs to be described thoroughly and methodically as it is very unlikely the FVM method is covered is any other course (unlike finite difference).  Then, the  equivalent of all the FD schemes needs to be implemented in class.   Granted the FVM wonât be much different from the FDM for 1D problem it is probably the most logical place to introduce it. Extension to 2D problems will be relatively simple for the FDM method, but it should still be covered in a way that students can see how the algorithms are extended in a second direction.  This was they can easily extend the algorithms to a third dimensions on their own if needed in the future.  This is where the most time on the FVM should be spent as it will show the difference between the FDM and FVM method more clearly.  Additionally, it wasnât covered in this class but how to solve a problem on an unstructured grid, using the FVM, should be taught.  As I understand it, this is one of the largest benefits of the FVM method.  Also, sinc e the FVM is the most widely used in practice, it only makes sense this should be covered more thouroughly. Additionally, I think the full Navier-Stokes equations should be introduced in the first week of class.  This isnât unreasonable, as it was done in the first week of Convective Heat and Mass Transfer.  This way students can see the full level of physics that are being modeled.  Then as start learning in 1D, incompressible, inviscid example we can be shown how the NS equations are simplied to reach the governing PDEs for this case.  Then when we move to 2D, then compressible, then viscid we can do the same thing and see what simplifications are made to the NS equations to reach the governing PDEs for that case.  I feel this would help a lot especially when we get to the Euler equations and we start using flux vectors.  This makes it significantly easier to understand what each component of the state vector and the flux vectors means.  With an understanding of that, will come a much better understanding of the Euler equations and solution methods for them. More time should be spent on flux vector splitting.  The different ways in which it can be split, what this means physically and mathematically, when it is and isnât necessary, and how it is implemented in both the FDM (studied first, but quickly) and then the FVM (studied in more detail). The time spent on each portion of the class material didnât seem adequately distributed.  Far too much time was spent on simple to understand concepts which are either partially or totally covered in pre-reqs, and not enough time was spent on actual CFD applications rather than just numerical methods.  If we plotted it with time on the x-axis and material covered on the y-axis, it was almost seem like a linear curve with a very small slope over the first 9 weeks and then the curve suddenly turns exponential and rises very rapidly over the last few weeks.   I feel it should be more of a exponential curve at the beginning quickly covering the simple numerical method type of things (which should be review from pre-reqs) and then when we rich the more advanced material (FVM, Euler equations, etc as decribed above).  The curve should become more linear as we progress more slowly and carefully through the new, more advanced, material we havenât seen in other classes. Once again, I would like to iterate that I had no CFD experience before this class.  Not in any other classes (except undergraduate Fluid Mechanics) and not in research.  I started learning CFD at the beginning of this course.  I did go beyond the course by watching the ME-702 CFD lecture videos from Boston University on YouTube and working through the 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes python modules during the first two and a half weeks of class.  These are linked in the sources at the bottom.  I feel the ME-702 lecture videos should be more of how the class is structured, but still with more emphasis on the FVM, flux-splitting, and the Euler equations than even the ME-702 lectures presents. This is the highest level of CFD that WSU offers. It is a 7000 level class, but I donât feel the content is repesentative of that.  Students who take the 7000 classes are driven, capable, students.  I feel WSU needs to be more confident in their students abilities and teach this CFD course at a level that will bring students to a high enough level that they could enter a career based in CFD and perform adequately, albeit at an entry level at first, without a lot of hand holding for their co-workers. Please note that the above is a criticism on the course content and not on the teaching ability of Dr. Camberos.  However, I do have some suggestions how how he may be able to make some changes to his teaching methods that may allow students to understand the content better.  I, personally, have never met a student who has learned material well simply from the instructor lecturing from powerpoints,  especially for a class like this.  I think if the instructor notes were a little more organized and were written up on the board as students followed along would be effective.  The powerpoints could be used as supplemental material which could be reference for graphs, tables, etc., and studied in detail by students in their own time if they donât have a sufficient understanding of the material from the lecture.  Dr. Camberos relied more on the powerpoints at the beginning of the course, but got much better at writing notes on the board and doing examples toward the end of the course.  Additionally, many of the algorithms are simple enough that they can be coded up together in class.  I think this would be better than providing pre-written code for students to use.  Its very easy to take pre-written code, modify it to make it do something else, without actually understanding how it works.  When I was a senior, for part of my senior design project I wrote a C++ code and GUI that took inputs from the keyboard and trasmitted it wireless to a robot for control.  I knew no C++ at the time and to this day Iâm still amazed how I was able to piece it together and get it working from a variety of StackOverflow questions and code snippets without having a sufficient understanding of what was going on.  So for class, I would have a volunteer come up and run the computer to start implementing the code.  The rest of the class can help out in describing how the algorithm can be implemented and the instructor can assist if he sees the class struggling.  I think this would give the class a better understanding of the implementation of each algorithm.  Also, since this is computational fluid dynamics, computational time is important and should be reduced as much as possible.    Granted this isnât a course teaching how to optimize numerical algorithms or their implementation for speed, but some basic thing should be mentioned.  For example, many of the posted MATLAB examples relied VERY heavily on for loops.  For loops are awfully slow in interpretted languages such as MATLAB and Python and instead vectorized operations should take their place (MATLAB vectors/matrices and Python Numpy).  Granted real CFD takes place in Fortran, C, or C++ for which for loops are still efficient, but as the vast majority of WSU engineering students (unfortunately) do not know these languages, it should at least be mentioned how CFD can be made more efficient in MATLAB (vectorizatoin). Overall, I enjoyed this course. Iâve always been interested in CFD and I greatly enjoyed learning about it.  I just feel like all of us could have learned so much more in the time we had, esepcially with the extra, unscheduled, class on Fridays.  For example, look at the CFD class from Notre Dame (link in sources below).  They are doing Euler Equations by the end of Feburary  (and they started later than us also, Jan. 18th) while we started Jan 9th and we didnât get to the Euler equations until later March / early April. The CFD content at WSU is far behind other universities. With minor tweaks to Dr. Camberosâ teaching methodology and a major restructuring of the course content, I believe WSU can have one of the best CFD courses in the country. One other thing that comes to mind.  Far too much emphasis is put on writing a report for each homework.  I understand the importance of having strong technical writing skills and I have often heard employers are not satisfied with todayâs graduatesâ writing abilities.  However, this is not the place to teach that.  Students are paying for a course on CFD.  All teaching emphasis, and especially all grading should be placed on CFD and how well the student is capable of solving CFD problems accurate.  This isnât the course to grade if a student has proper grammar and writing style, there are WSU courses dedicated solely to that (3000 level technical writing course).  Students would be greatly benefitted by removing the report requirement for each homework and assigning additional CFD problems.  On average, I probably spent 70% of the time writing up the report and only spent 30% of the time actually learning CFD concepts on each homework.   P.S.  Do a â12 Steps to Navier-Stokesâ type of module written in MATLAB (since most WSU engineering students only know MATLAB and not Python) would probably work great as a learning tool for the course.

2302,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Nice guy, goes too fast and jumps ahead too quickly. :: effective, tries to engage class. :: good. :: Pretty effective. :: Good. :: Scott was a very effective and very helpful teacher. He combined real world examples with what we were doing in class to make it relevant. His exams tested your knowledge but were very straightforward. He has very realistic expectations and makes everything very fair. :: Scott Thomas is an encouraging, motivated, and well equipped educator. He gives his students everything they need to do well the class, while also being very patient with students who are struggling with the material. :: Good. :: Very effective and generally excited to teach the course.  Also very helpful and understanding, took his time to make sure each student understood the material before he moved on. :: 9/10. :: Always prepared for the class. Takes time to explain concepts, and sticks to predictable grading and course schedules. :: Dr. Thomas was very enthusiastic and effective in his manner of instruction, assignment of useful homework, and occasional anecdotes on the application of specific MATLAB functionality to future engineering course. :: Scott was an excellent professor.  He laid out his expectations very clearly and followed through on these expectations.  Lecture style was set up nicely. :: He covered every topic he needed to, but was sometimes hard to follow. His teaching method is not for everyone. Sometimes he would explain how to do a problem without saying why the steps were taken. He was also very enthusiastic about the subject and teaching, which was nice, but it sometimes felt like it hindered his teaching ability. :: Best. :: Great teacher but expects students to know some knowledge from classes they might not have taken. :: He was incredibly effective at teaching the material that was covered during the course, and was able to address every concern I had with the class and the material I was learning. :: Very good. :: Very good for teaching and. :: The effectiveness was up to par with my expectations. :: Amazing professor, some how maintains the same energy and enthusiasm from the first day of class until the last. Makes what would be an otherwise boring programming class into a real world problem solving extravaganza. :: very good"
2303,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: little partial credit given. :: yes very very well. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Absolutely. We followed the syllabus more than any other class I have taken. :: Yes, he was very fair and upfront about what was expected of us during the semester and held us to that standard. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas was very clear and consistent in his evaluation and would remind the class prior to every exam and during transitions between subjects. :: Yes. :: He did not deviate from the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was right on. :: Yes. :: Yes they did. :: The all knowing-all powerful-all seeing syllabus has never been wrong. :: yes"
2304,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas was always on time and almost always used the whole period. If he did not use the whole period he would pull additional problems from past exams to provide more work to fill the time, which was very helpful, and provided clear outcomes for each class for when they're work was complete, allowing those who worked more quickly to leave when complete. :: Yes. :: Yes, class always started and ended on time. :: Yes. :: He started class routinely on time, and used the full class period. :: Started class on time every day and used the full time most days. Sometimes we were able to get out early if we finished a problem correctly and early. :: Absolutely. :: Yes they did. :: Every day, every time, on the dot. :: yes"
2305,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: engaging examples, traveled around room to help students. :: not really any. :: He made you feel like you were worth his time to teach or help you with homework or in class material. :: Lots of real life examples. :: Scott was always available for questions and willing to help in anyway he can. He would answer questions during class, via email, or during his office hours. He also provided lots and lots of examples and additional information you could refer to outside of class to make sure you understand what was needed. :: He encouraged questions and regularly checked on our class work to offer assistance. :: Learned everyone's names, educated us on learning opportunities, showed enthusiasm for what we were doing in class, and personally checked to make sure everyone was learning alright. :: He was the most enthusiastic professor I have ever had.  Very fun to be around. :: Yes. Provided examples and real life applications. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas would engage directly with students while they were working in-class problems and would show how what we were learning could be applied to our future coursework in other classes. :: Scott learned my name and answered my questions well, both in and out of the classroom. :: He was very enthusiastic about wanting everyone to know what he was talking about. :: Was helpful to all students and cared for their grades. :: He demonstrated an interest in our learning by providing examples from other courses that he teaches and using those examples to help the students understand the material. He also showed great enthusiasm for the material that we were learning. :: He made points about what we needed to know well and from the way he talks about what he does, you can tell he cares. :: We do the practice for every classes. :: Yes they did. :: He makes himself a living breathing diagram on whatever the topic is. I don't think there is another professor who invest more energy than this man into teaching. Love the guy. :: very good"
2306,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: well. :: okay. :: Very effectively. :: Great in. But nearly absent out of class. :: Very effectively. He responded to an emails quickly and answered questions in class. :: He was very clear and was always willing elaborate if a students was struggling. :: Very Well. :: Very effectively. :: 9/10. :: Very effectively. :: Dr. Thomas is a competent lecturer and provided ample assistance in the form of past exams and worked solutions to problems on the course website, which I appreciated and used frequently. :: Very effectively.  You were able to ask questions over email (this was encouraged) and the response time was always less than a day. :: Emailing him was never a chore; he was clear and helpful. During class he taught very fast and was hard to follow at times. :: Yes. :: He was available to contact for a long-range of times during the whole week. :: Very well in the classroom, didn't do much talking out of the classroom though. :: Very well in and out of the classroom. :: He is very punctual, when he says he will be done grading by a certain time he means it. In class he tries his best to reach to every single student no matter how big the conference room is. :: very good"
2307,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes very. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes we followed what was in the syllabus and he had very organized notes which took the entire class period without going over. :: Yes, very much so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The course was very well organized and progressed logically, and might be the only course I've ever taken that both used the entire textbook and required the textbook for achievement of best learning outcomes. :: Yes. :: Everything followed the syllabus and was very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Each day was right from the syllabus and he knew exactly what needed to be explained more from the notes given. :: Yes. :: Yes it was well organized. :: again.. THE ALL KNOWING-ALL POWERFUL-ALL SEEING syllabus has not failed us. (In the syllabus is a detailed schedule of all the lectures per date and when homework for said chapter will be due and he has followed it to the core). :: yes"
2308,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I would assume so. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was reasonably available and responsive to my needs. :: I did not try to meet him during office hours, so I do not know. :: Yes. :: Yes they were. :: Always available and if not he clearly states it for us and lets us know. :: yes"
2309,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He has a stupid and unnecessary policy on 'no late work'. He does not accept late work under any circumstances.  On one occasion, my partners laptop crashed 30 min before class started. His screen was frozen on the ""submit homework page"" on pilot. His homework was visibly completed, he just couldn't turn it it. He showed this screen to the professor 15 min before class started and asked if he could help get help turning it in from either the proff, or a TA. The Professor and his TA were sitting back and relaxing, already set up for class. They looked at his screen and told him 'too bad'. I had a very similar situation later on in the year. His reasoning for not accepting late work is because he ""doesn't want too"" and was ""walked over by students once, wont do it again"".  I am paying thousands of dollars to go to WS, I should not be prevented from turning in work simply because a professor doesn't want to hit accept on pilot. Or, He should at least make acceptations for people who are unable to turn it in because of reasons outside of their control. :: Pretty good teacher for a difficult class. :: Overall good teacher, although some of the in class material was sometimes vague. :: no. :: Scott Thomas is an excellent instructor and I would highly recommend him. :: Posted old exams and thats all you need to do well in the course. :: Sometimes, homework and exams didn't always correlate.  One always felt harder than another.  Overall, I would recommend this course to other students. :: No. :: Great instructor that loves his job!. :: He is not flexible for greading the exam  and no extra cridt give the student if no miss classses and homework. :: None at this moment. :: Best professor I've had a Wright State. Any class that can be taken with him, I recommend to everyone that they should do so. :: he is very good"
2310,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective and motivational in class, wants you to succeed. :: great. :: Scott is as good as they come at Wright State, and quite frankly made my experience in Senior Design an amazing one. He cares so much about your success and isn't afraid to give you much needed criticism at points. I had him as well for my technical elective advisor and he took the time out of his day to come out on base to the AFRL where I worked to show how much he cares about the success of his students. :: Scott was great this semester. The way that he had both Capstone I and II set up was designed for the teams to be able to succeed, in my opinion. Nice guy with a great sense of humor. :: Very effective. I enjoyed the more personalized meeting periods throughout the semester. Some assignments could have had more structure: as in a rubric our guidelines. :: Very good professor that is actually engaged in each teams project. He shows curiosity into each teams project and methods and has a genuine interest in the outcome of each individual in the course and even post graduation. Not many professors are like Thomas and i wish more were. He demands a lot from his students, but is reasonable with evaluations and gives valuable advice. :: Amazing! no one has ever run this better. All other ways of running this class should be banned. he kept us on task allowed for the time needed to actually complete a task and select our work environment. contrary to the misconceptions of the mechanical department in the real world you do have influence in your work environment if your truly do not like your coworkers supervisors or the project you can always change jobs. It is insulting and absolutely abysmal that the department assigned teams and projects. The individual responsible for that idea has demonstrated a complete disregard for students and a view that is out of touch at best. mandatory activity's playing with marshmallows and going over ethics we have a thousand times is another point that is absurd I can not count the number of times I have gone over the Pinto Challenger and it goes on and on the ethical blunders covered in my intro class. The fact the one of the only 4?.. Professors in the engineering department with true concern for his students is worried he will be in trouble for running the class an actual beneficial way is just absurd and a testament to why our college should be under scrutiny. :: Good. :: good. :: Very effictive and is beyond all reproach. :: Helped us always in class and out if class. :: Great teacher. He pushes the students very hard to do their best."
2311,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes and stuck to it very well. :: Yes he did. I received a zero on an assignment and i totally deserved it. And he graded fair and to his expectations. Always stayed on line with his syllabus too. :: Yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was pretty clearly outlined and followed it rather well. :: Yes!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Sometimes he was not very specific about what he wanted for an assignment, so it was hard to get a good grade without knowing what needed to be included in the assignment. This often meant redoing small portions and not getting a bad grade."
2312,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did, and took time to make sure to talk to every team and genuinely care about their projects. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2313,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Yes. :: kept us involved. :: Absolutely, made me realize I made the right choice to study mechanical engineering. :: He allowed us to work on our project more than use class time to just ""talk"" about it. This ultimately was the driving force behind my team (and many others) completing their senior design projects and learning at the same time. Always had a valuable opinion too. :: Yes, very much so. :: See first question. :: Scott is one of a few teachers I felt has actually been interested in my education every time I have had him that includes the one class I had to repeat. in this case he provided a plan that allowed us to actually complete our goals. :: Good. :: .. :: By asking insightful question based on our project. :: Speaks with us on our project always. :: Pushing us to the maximum of our potential."
2314,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effective, quick email response. :: great. :: Very well for both. :: Communicated great in the classroom, and replied to emails when it was necessary. :: Very well. :: Very well. Emailed entire class if there was pertinent information and cleared anything up quickly if any individual or team had any questions about anything. :: Extremely Well!. :: Good. :: well. :: Very well. :: Very good. :: Good with emails."
2315,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Very well organized, considering this was his first time running a senior design class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2316,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Always!. :: Never had to meet with him in his office hours, but he was available to reply to emails when needed. :: Yes. :: yes absolutely. :: He responded fast at any point we tried to get ahold of him. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Very much so. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2317,Scott Thomas,2018 Fall,ME 4920,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- One of the best professors at Wright State. :: no. :: Scott is hands down the best instructor for Capstone Design and should really continue to keep doing it. :: Thank you Dr. Thomas for all that you did for me and my teammates this semester. You did a fantastic job for this senior design class and i can only hope the university allows you to continue to run the senior design groups. You joke about ""i hope i wasnt awful"" and trust me, you were far from it.  Taylor McDowell. :: -. :: Any and all future professors should look to Scott Thomas as an example for how Senior Capstone should be taught. He was reasonable on his demands and made class scheduling friendly for every team. He provided everyone with the information necessary to be successful and gave every team the maximum amount of time in and out of class to complete projects. The administration should ask Scott Thomas how to run the final course for seniors so that every graduating senior from here on out can be given the best opportunity for success not only on the final project, but for their careers after graduation. Scott is awesome and provides awesome advice. :: Dr. Thomas is one of the best professors the university has at no point do you fell like a disposable number, nor does he have no interest in the teaching aspect of the job the way so many others do. :: Nope. :: no. :: No"

2326,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,201880,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Bridget did a good job. :: Learned more from my TA than the actual professor. She would try to walk students through homework examples and clear up any confusion. :: Helpful. :: The instructor was very effective in creating a lecture that also included group and table activities. :: Bridget did well.

2334,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,201880,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The TA was amazing. :: kghf. :: effective. :: Vamsi Krishna Vempati was very helpful in recitation when he could be. The only problem we had was recitation was often held after the homework was due and therefore Vamsi did not have a lot of opportunity to help.  He did answer any questions that were asked in class and went through several examples of questions until everyone understood. :: great TA. :: None.

2350,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not good, Consistantly felt like I was being talked down to, practically read from slides. :: This class is super hard. Too much work and his quizzes are impossible. :: He was quite ineffective, all learning was put onto you, homework and quizzes covered topics that weren't discussed. :: I did not learn very much in this classroom structure. :: Pretty rough. Talked about many things that he doesnât put into homework. Barely covers anything on homework. Not his fault that the subject is boring, but can not engage students nonetheless. :: I think I learned a lot about the structures and properties of materials but I'm not sure the rest of the class did.  I think it is hard to motivate the mechanical engineers to pay attention in class because all they need to continue in their majors is a C in the class. They also view it as an unnecessary gateway course. :: somewhat effective. :: He lectured often and occasionally ran in class exercises. The lectures were not as helpful as the could have been. :: Very Boring. :: This instructor was very effective in involving a lecture along with team and table activities. :: Worst I've ever experienced. :: Ineffective, was bad at keeping the classes attention. :: yes. :: he relied on using online materials and not lecture to learn. :: Dr. Srinivasan was not a very effective teacher. The way the class was structured we were expected to read the book and memorize every small detail mentioned in it. The lectures would go over some concepts covered in the book, but his quiz questions were rarely on these topics. The quizzes were often on several hundred pages and he would ask very specific questions over tiny details instead of testing our knowledge on the broad topics. Many questions were over things we never talked about in class. You only get about 30 seconds to a minute to answer the questions and then you do the same quiz as a group with being allowed to look up notes, but again the questions were so strange and the time constraint so small that you really did not have time to look them up. Also on the group quizzes, you only turn in one quiz which is disappointing because if you do not agree with the rest of the group, you can get a problem wrong because the ""majority"" outvoted you on the correct answer. There were a few quizzes that my group score was lower than my individual score. The ONLY good thing was that these quizzes weren't too large of a percentage of the overall score. They did, however, make the lectures seem pointless. He would cover somewhat interesting information but because he talked so fast you couldn't take notes even if you wanted to, not that notes would even help you on the quizzes.  The homework was also incredibly frustrating because they were scored on WileyPlus where sometimes the answer would be .01 off and you would still get the answer wrong. The worst part of the class, however, was the annotations. These were on Perusall and were a good idea in theory but were terribly executed. The problem is that Perusall has some very strange idea of what makes a ""good annotation."" We were required to make 5 annotations on the reading whether that be adding a comment, asking a question, or responding to a question. The people who did not spend any time reading and just simply googled a word and then copied and pasted if the definition directly from the website often got full credit for their annotations while people who actually tried to put intelligent questions or comments often found that they did not receive full credit. Dr. Srinivasan did not seem to review the annotations in any way to confirm what is a good or bad annotation and instead relied entirely on Perusall's evaluation. :: Does a good job at explaining things in class. :: Not very effective. Everything I learned was after or before lecture from reading the book. :: This instructor was very effective. :: Lectures were boring and not engaging. The structure of the class involves reading the book, doing homework over equations and then being quizzed on concepts. Emphasis was placed on involving students, but ultimately turned into a standard lecture. :: Dr.  Srinivasan was a good instructor who knew his material well.  The class could have been more effective in a non scale-up classroom type setting. :: class doesn't feel very effective. :: Good with structuring the lectures and relating the information.  It is hard to relate that much information with all the math intertwined and still keep lectures informative. :: Not very effective. :: Not the best. :: Not at all effective. :: Seemed very knowledgeable but the class was not structured very well. :: Nope. :: pretty good. :: Instructor tries and cares, but the class is disorganized and it is hard to follow key points. :: The instructor was effective in teaching his material. He is knowledgeable about the material and can answer almost any question thrown at him. :: 7-10. :: Somewhat strange in the methods during class. Not the usual and ideal structure that I am used to. :: I was often unable to follow the lectures because I would struggle to hear the professor speaking in class. It was hard to focus on the lecture when he would pause randomly while speaking. I feel that the use of teaching assistants is not being well utilized in the class. Our TA very seldomly interacted with us and was often unable to answer questions we asked. :: Raghu was a terrible professor. The only content I learned from this class was what I read in the book. His lectures were boring and is very hard to hear. The structure of this class sucks. Not everyone learns from forcing us into groups and taking class time to do examples that no one knows how to do because we were never taught how to do them. This class is an absolute joke and not worth forcing all students to take. You can learn all you need to learn from this class by shortly covering it in the Mechanics of Materials class. :: Dr S is very knowledgeable on this subject. :: Dr. Srinivasan was a very effective speaker with well prepared lectures. He had lots of practical examples. He was also prompt to start class and lectured for full periods and answered all questions with good explanations. I will highly recommend him to anyone. :: Somewhat effective. Lots of questions during the lecture because he wants the class to be interactive and I completely get that but some of it can be a little bit too dry and people lose interest."
2351,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Nah, quizzes were nothing like what the lectures entailed. :: No. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yeah, I thought the class was supposed to be run differently based on syllabus, but grading was fine. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Read people's comments in order to repsond to popular questions. :: no. he didn't evaluate anything, he used the online sites to grade for him. :: As mentioned the quizzes did not really cover what we did in class and honestly I felt the teacher did very little actually evaluation of our work. The annotations and homework were automatically scored by the program and the quizzes were done using TurningPoint clicker system which again automatically graded the quizzes. The only thing Dr. Srinivasan claimed to do was review the quiz questions to see if there were any that needed thrown out based on the responses. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He definitely evaluated my work based on the expectations in the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: not really. :: yes. :: pretty good. :: The class is well planned, but due to numerous issues with the programs used for work and grading, i believe the effort and work completed in the class is not fairly evaluated. :: The syllabus was often changed so many times that I failed to keep up with it. :: computer graded. :: Yes they did. :: I guess so, I did feel as if I questioned grading due to the fact that almost all student work is electronically evaluated. The online homework would often mark answers wrong for being slightly off and the problems would fail to display the figures required to answer the questions. I doubt the accuracy of the clickers being used for the quizzes and attendance. :: I guess so. Raghu did not grade anything. Everything is graded by a computer or by a TA. He did not evaluate my work. A computer algorithm did. :: yes. :: Yes, everything was clearly outlined. :: The syllabus and schedule changed a bit during the semester. I am not a find of Persuall which is the majority of the grade as the grading system of Persuall is not very clear and it can cost you a lot of points."
2352,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, too much so, doccing points for those who left early for completely valid reasons and grading attendance. :: No. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes and typically. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always used the entire class time. :: yes. :: class always started late so people could get fully logged in for the turning point software that was never used during lecture as with other courses requiring. it was only used for attendance and bi-weekly quizzes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he all of the time. :: Yes. :: Yes, attendance was taken frequently. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: pretty good. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes they did. :: Yes class would start in a timely manner and would run the whole time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did perfect all semester. :: Yes, very punctual professor"
2353,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- by forcing us to work in groups to waive that responsibility from himself. :: He didnât. :: I saw no interest directly from him only from the TA's. :: He kind of did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Not sure, but its hard to demonstrate interest in the learning of 100 different people. :: He didnt. :: Instructor wanted students interaction in lecture not just during the group activities but also when asking students questions during the lecture. :: he did not. :: Seemed like he was interested but was overall ineffective. :: yes. :: he never answered questions fully or taught us how to do the homework. we would respond online to the book reading which he didn't even assess, he let the software assess it. :: I am not sure. :: He would look at the comments we made and questions we had online and style part of his lecture around answering those questions about the material. :: No interest most of the time. On topics he was interested in he would. :: He was interested in my learning very well. :: He made use of pilot and technology frequently.  Communication was great. :: yes. :: Always quick to respond to questions and concerns. :: He didnt. :: Lecturing. :: yes, although what we were learning wasn't relevant to the homework at all, and led us unprepared for quizzes. :: Somewhat. :: pretty good. :: Plentiful examples and many real world applications to show the usefulness of the class material. :: He did not - I felt the structure of the class was very odd and there was a separation between lecture/quizzes/homework/recitation. It did not feel like an entire class, it felt more like two separate classes rather than a lecture and recitation combo. :: didnt. :: Yes they did. :: He seemed to be interested in our learning. :: He didn't. He paused for 10 minutes at a time waiting for someone to answer a question and instead of accepting that no one knew the answers he wasted time with his nonsense expectations. :: yes. :: He had create ways of teaching and holding class attention. :: He is very in your face which can be intimidating at first but he is wanting for the students to show as much interest as he does."
2354,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Nothing of note here. :: He never did. The TAâs did. :: His comunication could have been better. :: He communicated well. :: Very effective. Sent out plenty of emails and notified us anytime our schedule of work would change. :: communicated well. :: Lots of schedule updates/ changes along the way, most things were hashed out through class emails effectively. :: Good. :: Very effectively would respond within a day of messaging. :: He was terrible, he never responded to a single email. :: Was very effective at communication outside of the class. :: In large classrooms, this is kind of tough, but the communication was just there. :: He was open out of class but i only had dealings with the software as he wasn't the one grading my work. :: Occasionally Dr. Srinivasan would respond to emails, but most of the time your questions go unanswered and unresolved. :: Well. :: Never responds to emails. Extremely common problem for all of my classmates. :: Very well because he sent out emails regularly and let us know in lecture what was coming up. :: Well. :: Well. :: okay. :: Good always sent emails and had updates in class. :: Well. :: Good. :: good. :: He did a good job. :: pretty good. :: Email updates, but mostly to correct errors or issues with grading programs. :: He responded to emails within a day. :: responded to mail in a timely manner. :: Somewhat effectively. :: He would communicate via email frequently, but I feel like sometimes was unclear about grade corrections. He would state that we would get points back due to grading errors, but I do not feel like we have received those points back. :: He was not very responsive. He answered our Indian group member within an hour. However when I, a white student, emailed him, I waited for 4 days with no response and had to forward my email to him again to finally get a response. My other white group member sent him an email and waited for 2 weeks without response. He emailed him every day to ensure it did not get lost in the massive amount of emails that get sent in and he ended up waiting over 2 weeks to get a response. :: does not respond to individual emails. :: He was fast with responses, and always alerted students ahead of time. :: He is on your email as if it was text messages. You cannot NOT hear of him. He will also respond reasonably fast"
2355,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- He had to revise his syllabus six times through the course of the semester. :: No. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: ""Yes. :: somewhat. :: I suppose. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: yes. :: no. the lecture was about items we did homework on for class, and we had to read the material the week before. so during lecture i would either work on the homework for the next day that was next day's lecture or i would annotate the online reading which was for next week's lecture. :: No. Lecture notes were often posted on moments before lectures and we covered things so quickly it was impossible to take notes. If you didn't have to try and know every tiny detail in the chapter for the quizzes, the lectures would have been a lot more enjoyable and helpful. Dr. Srinivasan knows a lot of information and being able to just listen to him and absorb what he was saying. :: Yes. :: Organized like the book did. :: This course was very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: well organized but poorly executed. :: yes. :: Not at all. We had homework due before he lectured on it. He changed the schedule 5 different times but left all the schedules on pilot so you didnt really know what was due when. :: Yes. :: nope. :: meh. :: pretty good. :: Planned well, poorly executed. Even the TA's could not answer questions or provide information most of the semester. :: Somewhat - several changes were made throughout the course. :: yes. :: Yes they were. :: It was often hard to know what in class exercises we were doing in lecture. :: No. The only organized part of this class was the fact that he has used the same powerpoints for forever and then never updated them. The due dates constantly changed. Quiz dates were changed multiple times. The entirety of this class was waiting for him to choose a due date and stick to it. :: yes. :: They were completely organized and the class was well planned. :: Every lecture powerpoint will be uploaded to Pilot. You will not miss anything."
2356,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Not the most responsive to emails from what I've heard. :: He didnât have office hours and will never respond to emails. :: Not really. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Not sure. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: Was very efficient at responding in a timely manner. :: yes. :: He wasn't involved in the grading process so i didn't feel the need to approach it. :: Sometimes he responded in a reasonable amount of time, sometimes you did not get any response at all. :: Yes. :: Never responded to emails. :: I have no clue because I never needed to contact him outside of lecture. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always quick to email with responses and would email whole class on most issues he felt others would have the same problem with. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: pretty good. :: Yes. :: Unsure - did not require office hour meetings. :: yes. :: Not applicable. :: I have sent an email inquiry about an error in my attendance grade; I attended every class, but have a 92/100 for my attendance. I have yet to receive a reply, but will be quite annoyed if it is not resolved as this error due to the clickers could effect my grade in the course quite significantly. :: No. I addressed this above. :: I personally never used any of these, but other students said he was very accessible. :: Always, responds to emails reasonably fast"
2357,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I percieved him as very narcissitic in his teaching, Once he even mocked the class when 80% got a quiz question wrong. I've heard he is a very good teacher for other classes, but he doesn't need to be teaching this one with his unproductive ""interactive learning environment"". :: No. :: I did not like how this class was structured, he barely covered what was in the reading, quizzes and homework was based purely on the reading not what was covered in class. :: None. :: I would cut the lecture or the Perusall out of the course. I understand that both are there for multiple reasons but the reading is causing most of the students to not pay attention in class. Instead I would suggest that the group exercises would be more of the class period for a small amount of class or extra credit graded with the clickers. :: Not the best class I've taken, I think that the class could be made more engaging or helpful to students. The current methods used are not the best, but I don't really know how to make those better so.. :: no. :: Very fun, interesting, and interactive class. :: He graded incorrectly all the time, never responded to emails, never taught anything with the intent for us to learn, and he tested us on material that was barely or never taught. :: The class itself is set up terrible and needs to be reconstructed. The class itself seems to have interesting material but it gets lost with the work load behind the class. The homework seems to have no relevance to what is tested over. Annotations where a terrible idea, most of the learning is done n your own, which begs the question why do i need the professor if i am doing the learning by myself reading the textbook. :: no. :: quiz problems could be asked during lecture so as to get an idea of the quiz or our understanding, as well as organizing the homework to be after the lecture and the reading the day before or something. :: This class could greatly benefit from some restructuring. I was very excited about this course because this is my area of interest but this was by far my least favorite class. I would have rather had this class online than to waste time in lectures since I felt like I was expected to learn everything in the book on my own anyways. If I didn't have to go to lectures, I would have more time to learn what is in the book. :: He was extremely disinterested in teaching and it showed to the point where it was hard to learn the material. Class consisted of him reading off a power point slide and going through it so fast you could not process all the information in time and had to teach yourself out side of class. :: The online programs were not very good. Wiley plus was hard to use and get correct answers.  The annotations seemed a bit excessive and how they were graded made no sense.  Would grade making sure the annotations were spaced out enough and the fact they grade the content is weird.  Annotations should be diffent for every person and shoould be there to help them understand not universal and should be graded on them.  Seemed excessive to have to pay for the onlinle book, perusall for the annotations, WIley plus or homework and the clicker. :: This class is not set up well but hes an okay professor. :: perusall/annotations were useless, make online to stop wasting everyone's time. :: He never introduced himself to us. Had no idea how to say his name. :: pretty good. :: Please find better programs for grading. The online book is awful to deal with and makes studying nearly impossible. :: None. :: None now. :: I wanted to enjoy this class, but it really just felt like I wan jumping through hoops to ensure I got a good grade. I struggled to find a connection between the lecture and the homework and I often felt that the quizzes had trick questions that would be hard to answer unless you memorized the textbook. :: This was the worst class I have ever taken. Raghu is the worst professor I have ever had. He cannot teach and does not care about the students. He is only here to do research and should not be a professor. The only good thing about this class is that it is a GPA cushion for the classes that actually matter. The entire class should be restructured with a different professor. I learned nothing other than how not to teach a class should I ever choose to do so. Raghu does not grade anything for this class. He relies on computer programs to do his job. The annotations were the absolute worst thing to do. Not everyone learns from that and you should not be able to grade a student's personal thoughts and notes on how ""relevant"" they are compared to key words run through by an algorithm. This class was ridiculous. :: Thank you Dr. Srinivasan for a great class. :: Maybe take a look at Persuall. It might not be the best grading system for the students, and the clickers, although convenient, fail to work too often and we end up using pen and paper even thought the students had to pay for this services at the beginning of the year."
2358,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- bad. :: Recitation TA literally did not know the material. When asked questions she didn't understand and just copied off a paper onto the board. :: There is a lot to be learned in the class, but due to the disorganization, it is hard to keep up with it all. :: Taught by a teaching assistant, this recitation is pointless. The recitation instructor goes over examples with limited dialogue on their context to the class. Were were told attendance was required, but instructor never took attendance. She did not seem that well prepared and often was unable to provide detailed explanations to questions. :: My TA was Kimia. She was not a very good TA. She was not very effective when teaching us how to do homework questions. Usually she taught incorrect methods. She was never sure of herself, she was very timid and not great at teaching in general."
2359,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- no. :: Syllabus explained a process, but due to numerous issues with the programs involved, I believe evaluations were not accurate to the actual work and effort put forth. :: Yes, I guess. :: There was no evaluation."
2360,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- no. :: showed up little late to every recitation. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: Yes
2361,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- she didnt. :: No interest at all. Showed up copied paper onto board. :: Provided many real world examples and applications of the material. :: No, did not have an interest in helping our success in the course. Would only show calculation examples with no explanation as to where data came from. :: She didn't"
2362,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- bad. :: Emails were sent many times with updates or issues with the class. :: what communication?. :: She was not effective at anything.
2363,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- no. :: Nope. The programs used for work had numerous issues and caused many delays in the schedule. Keeping up with multiple schedules being  changed multiple times made it difficult to keep track of which work to complete at what times. :: No. Nothing was organized about this class.
2364,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- no. :: Yes. :: Sure"
2365,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- She had no clue what was going on. :: The class is very disorganized. Even the T.A.'s were lost and unable to answer questions about what is going on or which assignments needed completing. :: The recitation for this class is ridiculous. I have other professors that don't require you go to recitation because NOT EVERYONE LEARNS THAT WAY. Taking attendance and making it 5% of your grade is absolutely ridiculous."
2366,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- did his job. :: The recitation for this class was not needed and is the stupidest class I have ever had to take. We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: Mohammad was generally effective in ensuring that problems were solved quickly and accurately. He was very quiet at times, however, and often hard to understand because he was very broad with his explanations. :: Dr. S is very knowledgeable about this topic. :: Dr. Srinivasan is a great instructor. I enjoyed his class, and learned a lot. I would definitely recommend him for future students. :: Knows what heâs talking about. Doesnât know how to teach. He doesnât connect to the students at all and doesnât ever give clear answers. Also is impossible to email."

We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: Mohammad often left after everyone else had left, and often came in a few minutes late. :: yes. :: Every class period for the full time. :: Yes, but doesnât take attendance efficiently. He uses the clickers to do attendance yet Iâve never missed a class and he didnât give me full credit for my attendance. Thereâs no way of proving it either because the TAâs donât take the time to do attendance themselves of their small groups they over look."
2369,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he tried. :: The recitation for this class was not needed and is the stupidest class I have ever had to take. We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: He did not generate nor demonstrate any interest from me. :: yes. :: He showed real world examples. :: He didnât
2370,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- yes. :: The recitation for this class was not needed and is the stupidest class I have ever had to take. We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: We were not able to reach Mohammad outside for the classroom, but this was because the professor was responsible for answering our questions. :: I emailed Dr S a couple of times and got no response either time. I understand the class size is large but trying to sent out generic emails to everyone instead of responding to personal emails is not very helpful. :: He had very fast responses to my questions. :: HA! He sent mass class emails and thatâs about it. He doesnât respond to you AT ALL. Better of waiting the extra time and HAVING to ask him in class."
2371,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 2700R,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- As far as i know. :: The recitation for this class was not needed and is the stupidest class I have ever had to take. We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: No, the course content and lectures were not well organized. Often, we would learn material in recitation much that we already had been quizzed over in the lecture. :: yes. :: Everything was perfect. :: No. Look at the individual class average of each quiz. Thereâs not one thatâs above a D. He gives us nothing to study, doesnât give us a clue of whatâs on the exams, and expects us to do this math homework online that he never fully explains."

We didn't do anything in here. The TA was not very responsive. I dont even know his name. :: Thanks, Mohammad, and have a great break. :: This class need restructured from the base up. Very poor organization. Little no help for quizzes. Even failing all the quizzes I have a shot at gettting an A, tell me how that makes sense? I hate to say it but the class is honestly a joke."
2374,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Extremely ineffective. Teaches nothing relevant. Merely reads things off the screen. He adds zero value to the course. :: Good teaching. Good student professor Interaction
2375,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Not at all. The objectives in the syllabus are not at all what he tests on. The tests are math tests even though it is a materials course. He tests nothing that has to do with understanding of materials concepts, his tests are purely math concepts. He teaches materials concepts but then tests purely on math. :: Yeah"
2376,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, he typically starts (and sometimes arrives) 5-10 minutes late. :: Yeah"
2377,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By giving a midterm and a final?. :: By not just teaching from the books but also linking them with various concepts, discussions research papers"
2378,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Not, most all of his instructions were extremely vague, his lab assignments were extremely poorly/ambiguously written, full of typos. You always have to guess or ask multiple times to find out when assignments would be due. :: Professor was always there to help and gets the doubts clarified"
2379,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Reasonably so. :: Yeah
2380,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He generally responded, but often times the response was unclear and unhelpful. :: Yeah"
2381,Raghavan Srinivasan,2018 Fall,ME 7760,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Absolutely terrible. This is supposed to be a materials course, and the tests are purely designed to test math. At most 20% of the tests were actually on understanding of materials properties, the rest were on integration, etc. Not only that, but after explicitly telling us that the midterm wouldn't have derivations on it, more than half of the midterm was derivations. Lectures had no added value by him, I could've just read the notes and gotten the same thing since that's all he did. :: No"
2382,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- very engaging and thorough with lectures and examples. :: not well. :: He was okay. :: Effective. :: Excellent first year instructor! I enjoyed this course as the semester went on. Very good in explaining the content to students. :: Very effective, taught very well, spoke loudly, overall great job. :: awesome. :: A lot of tutorials but not many professional instruction. :: Very effective.  Went through the material a little fast, especially during the first few weeks. :: He will explain to us again and help us if we need him to. :: Very Effective. :: Overall Adam did a good job at teaching SolidWorks he knew how to use the program and if he was not sure of how to do it he would make sure he found out and would come back to answer the question. :: I loved this professor. He was super optimistic about his teaching. I also learned a ton. :: Fairly effective at teaching and communicating. :: very effective. :: Good. :: I'll just preface this by saying I only went to a handful of classes throughout the semester. That being said, the ones I did go to were not helpful at all. The first day of class he told us that he wasn't going to take attendance and that SolidWorks was something you learned by messing around with, so, to me, it seemed like he was saying don't bother coming to class. Initially, that's just what I did, because for the first few weeks he would be on top of Pilot and uploading notes and pertinent information. As the semester dragged on, however, he stopped uploading anything at all, other than homework assignments. He made no notice of the second midterm (which he himself said was too hard afterwards, but I digress). Overall, I don't entirely blame him for teaching the class poorly, as this was his first or second semester teaching, but still, I paid for this and I'm leaving with not much to show. :: Very ineffective.  He is really smart, but does not know how to teach the material at all and doesn't have realistic expectations for his students.  He goes through ""lectures"" so quick and it is very hard to follow.  He expects you to keep up but it is nearly impossible.  YE. :: 2/10. :: Lectures too quickly to understand what's going on, but very available to help supplement understanding."
2383,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes, tries to help students, wants students to succeed. :: yes. :: Exams were a little bit than what we were taught in class, and had to extend class to finish an exam. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Very good instructor. :: yes. :: 100%. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I guess? I never really questioned his grading scheme. :: yes. :: Yes. :: No, the grading and assignments do not reflect the syllabus very well, but are rather made to fit."
2384,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes, he normally let us leave an hour in. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. The class time was used very effectively. :: yes. :: Yes!. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He normally started class on time; however, he only ever used about half of the allotted time (so about an hour). He used the second half of class as more of a study hall of sorts, in that we could work on things, but it didn't really work that way, as most people just left after he was done for the day. :: He started on time but class never actually went up until 6.  He would do one example, very fast, and then let class out. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2385,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- lots of examples and class time to seek out his help and explanations. :: none. :: Very helpful on 1 on 1, but I didn't really learn much through lectures. :: Showing cool, complex design examples. :: He would go out of his way to help students individually if they were struggling with an assignment. Also, if a student had a question during a lecture, he would make sure it made sense to the student. :: helped a lot on homework. :: Answered every question. :: He will help us with anything. :: He stayed after class and made sure people understood what they were doing. Completed multiple examples and explained different ways to go about tasks. :: offered extra time in class to answer questions and office hours immediately after class which was convenient. :: Definitely made a boring software seem cool. :: This kind of class is very hard to engage someones interest in if they don't already like the programming, but with what was given, the instructor did a very decent job. :: allowed us to ask questions about obscure ideas and get help with homework. :: Gave opportunities for everyone to ask a lot of questions. :: I don't think he really did, but I also am not too sure what's being asked. :: He didn't."
2386,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- emails and office hours. :: not well. :: In class 1 on 1 he communicated very well. :: Very effectively. :: Fairly effective. Just have to check pilot and you were fine. :: emails. :: very effectively. :: Effectively. :: Very effectively. :: Highly Effective. :: Often posted on pilot about homework and several other due dates or important info. :: Very responsive to emails. I had a death in the family, and he responded quickly and with lots of patience. :: Good communication in class. Moderate communication outside of class. :: great. :: Well. :: In the classroom, he was fairly good, yet he constantly had to speak over my fellow students, and he never really seemed to try to quiet the crowd. I never tried to communicate with him outside of the classroom. :: Outside the classroom there was no communication.  He never responded to my email's or questions. :: 5/10. :: Well."

Online content was garbage. Hard to learn anything outside of the class since nothing was provided online after week 3 was over. Pretty much learned everything from outside sources to do the assignments/HW. Useless class. :: Yes
2388,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- always in class after for office hours, and would stay late to help if needed. :: no. :: Responded to emails timely. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. He gave us time to work on the assignments and answered any and all questions during this time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He and his TA's seemed to have an abundant amount of office hours so yes; however, I never utilized them. :: no. :: 7/10. :: Yes"
2389,Adam Donovan,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Not a great, not a great professor. Make use of pilot and textbook please. Some people do not understand Solidworks as well as you. :: Lectures need to be slowed down and need more TAs to teach 1 on 1. :: Highly recommend to possibly teach other courses at Wright State. He can relate to students and is a very knowledgeable instructor. :: Very helpful. I appreciate you taking time out of your day to help us. means a lot, thanks. :: There was not enough time given for the exams.  During one exam, he made it that took over the allowed time for the test without giving anyone a notice before hand.  At the last 10 minutes of the class period, while we were working on the exam, he said he would give us an additional 30 minutes.  He makes his exams take longer than they should.  I think he forgets we are new the program and are using new skills we learned either that week or a week before.  I think he forgets we don't use this program everyday for a living.  That is my only complaint. :: Very good job. :: Pretty good class overall. :: none. :: This class would have been better, for me, if the classes were interesting enough to necessitate attendance, or if all the information I needed was posted to Pilot. :: Smart guy, should not be teaching anyone."
2390,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Relatively effective. :: Very knowledgeable of subject, but I did not like teaching style. Not a word said by anyone else the entire lecture and copying notes the entire time. :: Fairly good. :: talked down to students. basically told us that no amount of studying will help us on exams. very condescending and did not encourage questions.  When asked a question, would make the student feel stupid by telling student ""this is easy. it is this way because that is the way it is"" but not explain the answer in any detail whatsoever. and would talk over the student to tell them he is right and the student needs to go back to notes and figure it out himself. :: He is a great professor and very knowledgable. :: Good instructor, but his teaching style does not match with the homework/exam problems. The lectures consist of theory and proofs but homework is computational. :: He covered all topics well, however more examples would be ideal. Not enough in-class examples. :: poor. :: Very effective teaching very difficult material. :: the instructor was effective at relaying information and teaching material. :: Gives organized handout. :: The instructor was very effective in his teaching style. He knew the material and demonstrated it with a great deal of knowledge. It was explained in a way in which we should and were expected to understand. :: I really liked his style of teaching, he had instructions to follow which made everything easy to understand. I felt like exams were fair, the part that I hated was there was only two problem in the exam which makes it really hard to get an A. :: he does a great job at explaining examples. very rarely, almost zero, were there times where he made mistakes even in his work which, allowed clear and concise reception of information. :: I had heard other students talking of bad experiences with thermodynamics classes, but this semester I had a positive experience. Dr. Sucosky did a great job at clearly teaching the course material. I enjoyed the use of handouts for applied examples as they limited excessive note taking and provided clear processes and figures. :: Dr. Sucosky is a very bright professor with a lot of good teaching skills. He has really pushed me to the point of complete understanding. There are no surprises, but his exams do require comprehension. He teaches methods, and how systems work, which will be very effective in real world applications. He is very effective. :: Perfect. :: simplifies the material and problems."
2391,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I felt like the instructor evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: yes. :: I thought the assignments were fairly evaluated. My only complaint is that initially, the expectations for work shown and derivations required on assessments were not clearly stated, but that was resolved later in the semester. :: All work was evaluated exactly as specified int he syllabus. :: yes. :: yes"
2392,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Every class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, always. :: Always. :: Yes, he was very punctual. :: yes. :: Like clockwork. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The class always started at the same time, he was perfect on letting his out perfectly on time as well. Thermodynamics is a really hard class, I had to study hard for it, but it paid out at the end. :: yes. :: Yes we started on time and used time effectively. :: Dr. Sucosky was always early for class and stayed late to answer any questions. He always taught the full time allotted for lecture. :: yes. :: yes"
2393,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He had multiple office hours today. :: Not really that much. :: very little interest in our learning.  He was condescending. Students were afraid to ask questions because he was so rude when presented with a question.  would make the student feel stupid for having a question and would talk over the student telling them this is ""easy material"" until they just stopped trying to ask their question.  Did not care if we understood the materials.  Only cared about covering as much material as possible with no interest in his students and their understanding of the materials. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was available when you needed him. :: no. :: Created several handouts for each chapter to show examples with pictures. :: All chapters were related to the final practical chapters. :: Learning first and second low of dinamics. :: He demonstrated true-to-life examples in which this material would be used. :: He had notes and problems for us to do during class time. The only thing that I didn't like out the class is the fact that his hand writing was not good. I had a hard time reading his hand writing. Other than that, I really like his style of teaching. :: modeled problems as real life examples. :: Yes, he was committed to our understanding of the material and was open to listening to student feedback after our class scores on an exam were lower than had been expected. :: Dr. Sucosky chose examples that were interesting and insightful. I came to him in office hours and he had genuine concern for my learning. :: yes"
2394,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effective communicator. It would be nice if the grades were posted online rather than just distributed for email. :: Very well. :: Well. :: very poorly.  After grading a tough exam, told students we have no hope of passing the final but did not give us any guidance on how to approach studying and preparing for the final  if we want to pass. :: He was very communicative about homework, exams and reviews. :: Yes. :: Extremely well. :: well. :: Very effectively. :: the instructor was effective at communication in and out of class. :: sent me back an email when I asked what's going to be covered on exam II. :: He often sent out emails to update the class on changes to the course schedule. :: I felt like the instructor communicate very well both in and out of the classroom. :: he responded quickly to any of my requests. :: He communicated effectively, and while not using pilot, the grade reports were very nice way of communicating grades. :: His communication was direct and was the fastest I have ever had from any professor. I definitely complement him on his response time. :: Perfectly"
2395,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes, but a little too organized. There was little room for people to apply their knowledge of the material. :: Perfectly organized. :: Yes. :: yes but very rushed. :: Yes, very organized. :: Yes. The lectures were too organized in the sense that it felt very forced and not interactive. :: Yes. :: well. :: Extremely. :: yes, the most organized I have ever seen. :: yes. :: Yes. :: the course content and lectures well very organized. :: yes very punctual. :: Yes exceptionally well organized. I appreciated that we followed a clear outline. I also appreciated that the course handouts were always posted well enough in advance of the lecture to allow for printing before class. :: Everything was organized perfect. Everything was very well laid out and easy to find. :: Yes. :: yes"
2396,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no.  I emailed him about midway through the semester, and STILL have yet to hear from him.  I ended up going to Scott Thomas for help.  He was more than happy to go over the materials with me during his office hours and review his old thermo exams and help me understand the materials for sucosky's class.  Scott Thomas helped me save my grade. sucosky could not be bothered. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Never had to contact him. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The professor was always there during his office hours. This helped me to ask questions incase if I didn't understand something during the lecture. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I came to him several times during office hours and he helped me a great deal. He cares for all of his students and encouraged all of us to attend office hours if needed. He was willing to set aside whatever time it took for any of his students. Dr. Sucosky was an outstanding professor in an after class. :: Yes"
2397,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He could work on providing more in class application of the material with the assistance of a TA to help answer student questions due to class size. :: Great professor. However, teaches only to one learning style. :: very condescending man. Huge lack of care for his students and blatant disrespect towards anyone who had questions and asked for him to re-explain something. :: No. :: no thank you. :: Great professor. :: good professor. :: None. :: I really loved his style of teaching, The exams were fair. You just needed to study and understand what was going on during class time. :: no. :: Dr. Sucosky is a great teacher, he pushes hard, but the learning and rewards are great. I will definitely take more of his classes in the future if offered. :: No. :: -"
2398,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Prof. Sucosky knows the material very well. His communication and clarity were beyond doubt. He has a good knowledge of what he's saying and where he's headed. :: Great instructor. :: Extremely effective. :: Very effective instructor. Love the organization of his lectures and the layout of the class. :: Best teacher hands down. :: Professor was very effective in his teaching. Was always emailing students how they were doing and would let students know how much he appreciated them when they improved and was always ready to answer questions and was always well prepared for all material for every class. :: Highly effective. :: Dr. Sucosky is very effective.
2399,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, he did. :: Yes. :: Yes, to the T. :: Graded exactly as described in the syllabus. :: yes defiantly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2400,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- He uses the class time efficiently. :: Yes. :: Yes. Without failure. :: Always started on time and used the entire class period. :: on the dot. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes
2401,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He's open minded, but he expects you to already know somethings and not forget about topics discussed in previous classes . :: Requested feedback from students about first exam. Asked if there were any questions at the end of each topic. :: By teaching us thoroughly  and giving us plenty of opportunities to do well on the exams. :: Was not thrilled with the first exam scores and pleaded with us to understand why we did so poorly. :: yes. :: By working through the notes in real time with students and explaining each point again after writing them down and providing handouts with example problems of what would be on exams and tables with all useful data. :: Well formed class and when an exam went poorly for most students took the time to ask students what was wrong and clearly explain the questions on the exam. :: The instructor answered questions when they were asked in class and showed true disappointment when the class did not do as well on a test as we should have."
2402,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He's easy to access with questions and tries his best to explains those questions. :: Very well. I really appreciate the emailed grade reports. :: Very effectively. :: Always responded to emails and questions in class. :: above and beyond. :: Very effectively. :: Very well. :: Very effectively. The semi-weekly grade reports were very helpful.
2403,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, very organised. :: Extremely well organized and well paced. :: Very organized. :: Very well organized. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Most organized out of all instructors I have taken. :: Yes!"
2404,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. Responded in a timely manner to emailed questions. :: Never had a need to go to office hours, but he responded to emails quickly. :: Always responds to emails in a timely manner and told us to come to office hours more often. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
2405,Philippe Sucosky,2018 Fall,ME 3360,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great class and instructor, extremely well organized, easy to learn with lecture set up, handouts, useful homework assignments and helpful exam reviews. Would appreciate other professors using this set up and/or if Dr. Sucosky taught more classes, especially required classes. :: Philippe is a phenomenal professor. I typically haven't enjoyed going to class (who would?) or studying outside of class, but he made me actually want to go to class and study outside of class. I greatly enjoyed taking him for a class and would do it again in the future. :: Dr. Sucosky is one of my favorite professors. I had him for fluids and I love the structure of his classes. :: No. :: Best prof. at Wright State. Deserves a raise. Either that or another school will come along and take away this high quality instructor."
2406,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- pretty good. :: I believe professor Wolff is very passionate about getting his students to the finish line the right way and exposing his students to real world circumstance in the controlled setting of the classroom.  I think overall he was effective as the capstone instructor. :: Not effective. :: This class isn't really a course work type of class, so it was good as far as this ""management"" goes. :: Dr. Wolff is very effective in teaching this class . He tells lots of stories about being a young engineer and provides lots of insight to what our careers will look like once we leave school. :: uses class time wisely, he's a legend. :: He seems to do okay as far as teaching the course the way it was designed. He does not like teaching the class, per him saying exactly that. :: effective. :: OK. :: Not bad. :: Not effective. Rambles on the entire class period about topics that most likely won't prepare us for the future. Instead we could have worked on our projects. He did bring in a few speakers from industry which were very beneficial. :: He brought in multiple outside personnel to show us aspects of what engineering will be like, and some effects that it can have on life. This was beneficial to students not knowing what to expect after college. He was unclear on some parts of the class though. Some assignments should have had more details provided, but this does help provide an example of hour the working world can be. :: Good. :: Demonstrated care for all the students, and gives all information he can possibly give to us for us to be successful out in the real world. :: Effective but abrasive. :: above average for Wright state. :: Mostly effective. :: the professor truly worried about the students work. :: a. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Wolff does a nice job conveying engineering practices and procedures to the class.  He uses guest speakers to allow the subject of engineering to be better understood to the students. :: The professor could improve on his overall effectiveness as a professor. To start off, the instructor needs to be more clear on what he wants for projects. He needs to work on his clarity of wording emails and what he says in class. For example, with emailing that there is a 10 minute presentation with 3 minutes of questions, he should explicitly say that the 3 minutes of questions are after the 10 minutes and not included in them. For presentations, he needs to state his guidelines. By only stating he wants an update or a proposal does not give the class guidelines of what he is looking for in a presentation. This also involves him actually saying what he expects in the presentations. He will critique one group for material in the presentation and then make no comment on the next group that did the same layout with their material. It seems that his grading is very based on his bias towards the class or almost the project of the team itself. The professor did provide good learning experiences but the class comes off as more of a networking class at times rather than focusing on how a team can improve with itself or how to work through the projects."
2407,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: all expectations were clearly defined and graded fairly according to those expectations. :: Yes and No, he evaluates us on our respective projects very scornfully, while we receive very little positive or helpful feedback if any. :: I would have liked to have seen grades throughout the semester, the only grade we got was for one lab book check and the rest was just good job. :: Yes. :: yes, always follows the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Hard to tell for this class. :: No. He gave us unclear instructions then became angry when our work wasn't exactly what he wanted. He gave us instructions for our lab notebooks, which were followed to the T. Then when they were graded, they were graded different from his instruction. We called him out on this, acknowledged he was wrong, and still wouldn't correct our grades. This review comes from a 4.0 GPA student. :: Our work was evaluated mostly off the syllabus. Some stuff was changed because of timing. The main change was less notebook checks, but this didn't cause a problem. :: yes. :: Yes. He evaluated it to a T. :: Usually. The first notebook check was a shitshow. Other instructions were often unclear. For example, with one set of presentations, the given guidelines were ""10 minutes with 3 minutes for questions"", but every group in the class was confused about whether this meant 10 minutes total (7 minutes presenting plus 3 minutes Q&A) or 10 minutes presenting and the Q&A time in addition to that. :: I still have no idea how capstone is being graded, or if it even is being graded. :: Roughly, the syllabus was pretty open ended and not true to any of the due dates listed. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Wolff gave many resources for the course and clearly discussed his expectations. :: No. The professor provided no grading guidelines in the syllabus, so students have no idea what grade they are to receive within the class. The students don't know what material they were graded in, what goes into the grade or even what part of the course plays the largest part into their grade. At the end of the semester, students are basically getting a grade that they have no idea what it will be. The only grades that the students received back were the lab book checks. The syllabus only included a timeline of the semester, which wasn't completely followed either. The professor needs to work on stating the requirements of his course and also clarifying the expectations that he has. :: yes"
2408,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Annoyingly soo.  Professor Wolff always started class on time and made sure he filled up the entire 3 hrs with content. :: Yes he did even though he did nothing but waste everyones time talking about stuff we have been taught for 3 years in college. He does have classes that are beneficial, but do not require the full 3.5 hour time period. And these classes that are useful come at a dime a dozen. :: Yes he used the entire class. :: Yes. :: always. :: Yes. :: yes, definitely. :: To a fault. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Class was always started on time and used the full period. :: yes. :: Yes. Wanted to use the full time for us to get the most benefit of the class. :: Yes. Always on time, always used the full period. :: Wolff is always on time, which I appreciate. He also uses the entire class period. :: Yes, to the point of stupidity. Not letting class end early ever, even when he would have to ramble for 20 minutes on something just to use all of the time. for crying out loud, we paid to be there, we should get to choose when we leave if you are wasting our time just talking for the heck of it. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he certainly did. :: The professor started class on time and was adamant on using the whole class period. I believe that is great to use the class time when it is needed, but spending 20 minutes just talking about a topic to fill the rest of the time I do not find beneficial. :: Yes,"
2409,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- definately. :: he was available for questions and went out of his way to bring in speakers to talk to us about the real world of engineering  so we are better prepared for when we graduate. :: He seems to care but not enough to go out of his way to help. :: He brought outside engineers in to do demonstrations and talk about life after school. :: Dr. Wolff brought it multiple people outside of the university to talk to us about their careers and experiences. He is also available outside of class if we had any questions. :: yes, cares about our futures. :: He had an individual meeting with each of us. He also focused heavily on presentations. :: answering questions, bring in guest speaker to teach about their experiences. :: I'm not sure he had an interest in me learning. :: Brought people in to talk. :: He evidently did not. :: He brought in outside personnel to help show ideas of engineering that he was not an expert in. :: yes. :: He brought in guest speakers to give us knowledge. :: Bringing in outside speakers of engineers that have been in different fields and taken various career paths was extremely interesting and informative. :: By providing useful and insightful criticism during presentations. :: Yes, but seemed unable to communicate things properly, and persisted with the course material that repeated things from years of school ago. :: he expected that show in class all the improvements i have done. :: Held outside meetings with everyone one on one. Asked for feedback during said meetings. :: He conducted individual meetings with each student to discuss the progress of our teams and to determine if there were any issues with any area of the team. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in our learning by providing speakers that we could ask questions to. He would also ask if anyone had questions and would answer them. He also did individual meetings to see how the groups are progessing and how well everyone was working together. He was also available during office hours for questions. :: Yes"
2410,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- 5/5. :: There wasn't much communication outside of the classroom for me personally but he was very punctual when addressing the class. :: Not well at all. I recall emailing him multiple times about questions I had and then after I would email him, he would email the class answering the question I had asked. Very unorganized. :: He was good about emailing us what we needed. :: Great. Always answers emails and is always in his office during office hours. :: very effective. :: Very well, sent out a lot of emails for clarification. :: effectively. :: Good. :: Pretty well. :: Not effectively as mentioned above. :: Communication was good. He would email us any changes, and he would tell us what was going on during weeks that changed. :: good. :: Very well. :: Relatively effectively. The syllabus schedule was not followed very closely so it was sometimes difficult to know if something like a notebook check would be taking place, unless it was mentioned in class. Email reminders are extremely helpful and I would encourage their continued use. :: The emails for the project proposal presentation was a little confusing and frustrating, the pilot page for this class has also been less than helpful. :: Moderately. Often would go two days without responding to emails, hard to get ahold of other than in class one day a week. :: always communicating what is going on in the next class. :: Very effectively. :: Very well both in class and thru email and the pilot system. :: The professor was available during office hours when I would go there. The professor improved towards the end of semester on sending updates of the class out over email. As long as he keeps up with sending emails to clarify the class and his expectations, his communication is sufficient for the class. :: Tried to keep in communication with the class and would answer emails in a timely manner."
2411,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Wolff seemed to be organized and well spoken however at the end of the class if we covered everything he would ramble to fill the entire time. :: Nope. :: Good enough for what this class is. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he set up several presentations from outside people which were really interesting. :: yes. :: Yes, up until the last 20 minutes of class. :: Yes. :: No, did not follow syllabus or his word. :: They were mostly well organized. There were some changes in the syllabus, but it didn't cause any issues. :: yes. :: Yes very. :: Yes. :: Yes, but they were dry and felt like a formality. :: Kind of, but they were pointless so it doesn't matter. :: yes. :: They were okay. :: yes. :: The courses were prepared for the fact that they would be carried out as he would state beforehand. They were prepared priorly and organized, in my opinion. :: Sometimes it seemed that he ran out of material or was drawing out material to fill time."
2412,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: always available if needed. :: Was the instructor available? Yes. Would it benefit anyone to go seek his guidance? No. :: We met once and he was helpful. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was very responsive. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I didn't personally contact him outside of class. :: yes. :: Yes. Even met with us personally. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Somewhat. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor was available during office hours and he would also respond to emails. He was responsive to questions that were asked through email or in office hours. :: Yes"
2413,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,201880,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: My only comment is that I think he loses the attention of the students having the class time so long at night. :: I believe the way this course used to be set up was perfect the way it was. However, I do understand the need to make it more like industry where you do not get to pick what project or group you are in to help prepare students for the workforce. I have a few complaints with how this class is now set up: In industry, you are on a team of professional, certified, or degreed engineers, not students trying to get their degrees. I understand that I, myself, do not have a degree either, however, I am a top tier student in WSUs engineering department with a 3.95 GPA going into my final semester and was paired, in turn, with students scraping by with their classes who are not motivated to get the job done. Compare this to the group I would've chosen to be in amongst other students with great GPAs that plan on going to graduate school and you can see my frustrations. Meanwhile in other groups, there were some that got to pick their own group AND their own projects. No announcement was made of the change until the fall and by that point, with the amount of groups and projects already chosen, this new process should not have been enacted into the capstone design curriculum until the following year or semester. My other complaint is about the projects that were assigned. Many groups were assigned or chose projects that are full of information and can easily impress outside companies. My group's project is not one of these projects. The project my group and I were assigned could be completed by a single engineer and there are two groups working on this exact project. Resume-wise, a project like the SAE Aerodesign looks far better than a simplistic project that I was given no choice but to take. Overall, I do not enjoy this class whatsoever. The instructor preaches about positive feedback, but cannot take his own advice and even had the audacity to tell one group, ""Don't waste my time"" when there are groups that do not have nearly as much information to present about as compared to other groups. Furthermore, the instructor and my current advisor have given my group new design specifications almost weekly, so we have to completely rework our design week to week due to our instructor wanting to make our project more difficult. This has made my group fall farther behind than any of the other groups in the class. It would've been much more beneficial for these specifications to be brought to our attention at the beginning of the semester so that way we could have more time to plan, but we were assigned new specifications 3 days before our proposal presentation. I really hope my complaints are thoroughly considered and evaluated. Thank you for your time. :: Not picking projects really sucks. :: Dr. Wolff is up front and honest. He cares about helping everyone in the class get ready for the senior design expo. I am grateful for everything he has done to help us this semester. :: always a good professor to have, I always learn a lot from him. :: He is doing this class as it is needed. however, he pretty clearly does not want to teach this course. :: no. :: Good Job. :: Needs work. :: no. :: Great Job! Keep it up!. :: Make sure that expectations for presentations are clear, either via email, pilot outline, or emphasized in class. This occurred multiple times, both with the ""10 minute with Q&A"" presentations AND with the end-of-semester presentations. I do not recall any discussion in class, document on Pilot, or email specifying that the presentation was supposed to be a proposal-- this was only made clear AFTER the first several groups had presented. :: Pay attention to the above, do not waste my time again. I paid a lot to be there and to get my degree finished, don't waste my time like this again. If its trivial nonsense and repeated information, you should allow people who are already competent to leave or work on their projects. :: no. :: I would prefer a greater focus on the actual project itself and less on general engineering.  Some of the topics such as the six sigma lecture or the talk with the library staff about research would have been better to talk about when I was maybe a sophomore. :: I would have liked to submit another peer review before the end of the semester.  During the second half of the semester some of my group members continued to not participate and I would have liked the opportunity to submit this to the instructor.  I would have liked clearer instructions on what was expected to go in the proposal.  I feel that we never received any sort of instructions or rubric on what was expected to go in the proposal or how we would be graded. The guest speaker that did the paper airplane activity was my favorite. :: no. :: Overall, I believe that this professor needs to work on clarifying his expectations for the class as a whole. He needs to make students aware of the grading structure, give laid out expectations for projects and papers and follow those established guidelines. This will help eliminate bias and also give students goals for what they need to succeed in. I also believe that it would be beneficial if he would have lectures where the students just came and worked on their individual projects. During the semesters, students are researching and will always have something that they will need to work on with their group. I honestly think that having at least a few classes where the students had go to the classroom and work on their projects would be way more beneficial than just filling the classes with so many speakers. Because in the end, the class is about the completion of that project, right? Classes of just working would be highly beneficial considering how busy senior year is for students. My main concern is the clarity of this professor. Here at the end of the semester I have no idea what grade I will receive and what it is based off of. :: It is not okay to chastise a student in front of the class! I donât care that the demonstration he decided to do wasnât the most professional or well thought-out. All you had to do was tell him his demonstration did not achieve what he wanted it to and didnât fit well with the presentation or tell him that you wanted to talk to him after class. To tell him to do nothing and shut up IS NOT PROFESSIONAL! Fine, you think he isnât taking this class or this presentation seriously. Then talk to him after class about it. You donât know what circumstances he might be in that led to this situation. You need to re-evaluate what you are doing here. Respect is a two way street and this shows a lack of it."

He would explain things in detail, and if we did not understand what was going on, he would try to help. :: Asking questions and answering any we may have had. :: . :: He asks lots of questions and makes us work through the problem with him. :: Wants us to succeed. :: Relating it to future classes (Propulsions). :: Yes. :: Dr. Wolff brought up interesting applications of the topics being covered and provided examples that were challenging but interesting. :: Dr. Wolff takes interest in your learning, he want you to succeed, but at the same time you have to earn every grade. He challenges you to make you learn. :: By giving students time to ask him about the HW. He also got the class involved in lectures so it was not just him talking to a bunch of statues. :: It is very clear that the Dr. Wolff enjoys teaching. :: Mitch Wolff is incredible, give him more classes to teach. :: he answered any questions and would challenge students in class with different questions and scenarios. :: Dr. Wolff learned the names of several classmates and had a very interactive lecture style which demonstrated interest in learning. :: Effort and enthusiasm were put into the lectures.  Prof spent time talking with students after class when needed.  Cared about students and helps them succeed outside of class via graduate research or other avenues."
2418,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,ME 4330,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very, especially via email. :: He was helpful in class and would respond to emails in a timely manner. :: very effectively. :: . :: great communication. :: Very well. :: Well. :: Very Well. :: Dr. Wolff communicated very well in the classroom. He explained topics very well. He was also very helpful in office hours. :: Very well. If you had questions he was happy to answer them. :: Dr. Wolff communicated very well in and outside the classroom. :: very effective. :: Mitch Wolff is incredible, give him more classes to teach. :: He communicated well both in class and outside of class. :: Dr. Wolff communicated well. The reminders with exam information were helpful to remember the classroom and materials allowed. :: Very well."

Very thorough. :: . :: yes. :: Always, one of the most organized profs I've ever had. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: They were. I had no problem in keeping up with the material. :: Yes. :: Dr. Wolff proceeded through the coursework in an logical manner. :: yes, his lectures followed the text which provided continuity between the in class and independent study. :: Mitch Wolff is incredible, give him more classes to teach. :: yes, he is very organized and his notes were well written. it was an easier class to take notes for. :: For the most part, course content was very well organized. Some things/chapters were scratched out of the syllabus and class often ended in the middle of an example problem, but the next class meeting would then start with a review of the start of the problem so that was helpful. :: Yes, All info was provided and topics were covered prior to homework being assigned."
2420,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,ME 4330,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Office hours and appointments, I would not know.

However, I would recommend to other students. :: No. :: . :: Dr. Wolff is great. His class is stragihtforward and there are no curveballs. He gives examples and fair homework. He cares about his students and wants to help. :: Great prof. Keep him around. :: Good Job. :: Wolff is an amazing professor!. :: I would like to thank Dr. Wolff for a great semester. :: Dr. Wolff is a very good instructor.  Dr. Wolff can kinda come off at first as kind of a ""stick in the mud,"" but once you get to know him and spend some time in class you realize he is very genuine, and trying to use to time wisely so you as a student can learn effectively.  I wish I could have either Dr. Wolff, Dr. Succosky, or Dr. Gockel for every course. :: Thank you Dr. Wolff for putting in effort into making this a class that is not a waste of the student's time. You also made the class something that even students that have other responsibilities to people and organizations not drop everything and devote 100% of their time to your class. I am sad that you can't make this a pass/fail course though. In short, If you teach every course like compressible flow; I will take it even if I had to pay double. Keep up the good work and have a great break. :: Dr. Wolff was the best instructor that I had this semester and I plan to take more of his classes. :: Mitch Wolff is incredible, give him more classes to teach. :: great professor, I am taking him for a third time next semester!. :: Dr. Wolff is a brilliant guy! I feel lucky to be learning from him. :: Great professor overall.  Exams were long but fair. Due to longevity, sometimes students who even know the material can struggle due to time constraints."
2422,J. Wolff,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good. Met regularly with me. :: Overall very effective. Regular meetings show that he's interested in the project and wants to make sure it's successful for all parties involved.

2430,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- okay. :: very good 1 on 1, sometimes a little unorganized in lecture. :: good. :: Somewhat ineffective. Very complex problems led to some very confusing examples. Shorter problems would have been very useful. :: I do not think this instructor was very effective. His lectures often left me with a lot of questions that he could not answer and did not help my learning. Reading straight from the book would have given me a better learning experience. The example problems were done incorrectly more often than not and important topics were described as ""assume this"" or ""assume that"". :: Dr. Mian did alright. I did feel class was confusing at times. :: Mian was not effective. It felt like he didn't prepare well for the class. He would come with examples full of issues or have to take breaks to go look through his example to figure out how to do it, even though he had his notes. Because he was going so slow, we got even more behind than we should have been. We missed one class, but were at least 2 behind so he just read off some papers with the answer from the book. Also, equations sometimes weren't given and variables weren't explained, so he was hard to follow. :: Middling-to-good. :: Dr. Mian, does a good job of listening and being available for question during his office hours. He does fair job of grading exams and understanding his students.  He does however, struggle with explaining course content during his lectures. I felt like sometimes he does not take time to prepare for his lectures so half the time equations and problems were wrong on the white board.  I struggle to follow him during class lectures, and felt like I would be better off to skip class and invested my time in reading and teaching myself.  I didn't however and I attended every class and did my best to follow his notes.  I would suggest he prepare his lectures a little better and stop writing notes so small on white board. :: He was not very effective. The homeworks were extremely long, and they were not helpful when preparing for the class. The exams were also extremely long and most of them we could not finish. :: Effectiveness could have been better. Lectures lacked structure, and as it got towards the end of the semester, any structure that was there was gone. A lot of the concepts that we went over were rushed through which made it extremely difficult to understand the material. :: Not really all that effective honestly. Hes a good guy and tries his best to portray information to his students. He loves what he does and is genuinely interested in what hes teaching, it seems. However, he is not all that organized and can get off track and go off on tangents frequently. While solving problems (often times in this class very very lengthy and demanding) he can skip steps and/or forget where he was and it makes learning how to solve problems difficult and confusing. The book does a great job at explaining how to solve problems but sometimes he either doesn't follow it or is unclear where he derived or got an equation or method from. :: Relatively effective.  I find example problems worked out on the board to be most helpful to my understanding. Just showing a slide with a problem already worked out is difficult to follow and is not helpful. I also prefer going through and deriving the relevant equations, instead of (again) being shown a slide with the equations needed and then moving on to the next slide BEFORE there has been enough time to copy down the equations. I gave up on trying to copy down notes of the slides posted because we would move through them so quickly. :: as effective as  parachute with  hole in it. :: Very effective. :: Good. :: Somewhat effective, but was unclear at times."
2431,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: yes stuck to the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: I guess. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he does good job in following the course syllabus. :: He seemed to grade it according to the rubric. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. It is a lot more helpful to me if you circle the area in the problem where I made a mistake, rather than just putting ""-6"" at the top of the page or putting a slash in a general area. This goes for exams and homework. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2432,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: always used full period. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. He often went over time, which really didn't make me happy. By over time I mean like 10 minutes past class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he always started on time.  However we were behind schedule for the class and he was trying to organized a class lecture outside the normal lecture hours. :: He started on time and always ran until the end of class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time, but routinely went up to 5 minutes over. This is a problem because I had another class that started 10 minutes after this class was supposed to end. Routinely he would say ""okay, two minutes left"" or something along those lines, and then continue talking for another 5-6 minutes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2433,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- asked us to come to his office for any questions. :: asked questions. :: I really don't like this question. Showed up, started on time, answered questions. :: Not entirely. :: He asked questions. :: He would talk about some of his projects and show a great deal of interest in them, but he didn't have enough interest to prepare for classes. :: quizzes and classroom discussion. :: He always listen to his students and tried to engaged with his students. :: He posted the notes online, which was helpful. The problem was many of these notes lacked certain formulas or concepts which made his quizzes challenging. :: -. :: yes he did. he always seemed interested in the students learning because he is genuinely interested in the material himself. :: Real-world examples were applied and examined for each chapter. :: by asking ""is it clear?"" after every 4th or 5th line of notes. :: Asked for feedback. Held review sessions outside of class time. :: Good. :: He made sure everybody understood everything by routinely asking us if we had any questions."
2434,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- kinda. :: always communicated well. :: good. :: Pretty effectively. :: Not very effective. :: He was available for office hours and by email. :: Communication was good. :: middling-. :: His best trait his keeping his office door always open for his students. :: He communicated canceled classes and some of the concepts clearly. :: Well. :: fairly well. Emailed when he posted stuff on pilot, or when things were due, although very brief with not much detail. :: Effectively. I found the ""Homework X posted"" emails to be extremely helpful. :: he efficiently communicated with 5-6 word emails about when homework was posted. :: Very effectively. :: Good. :: Pretty effectively. He is the only professor I have ever had who emails us to tell us when he posts new homework assignments, exam grades, etc."
2435,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- average. :: normally pretty organized although had some problems every once in a while. :: ok. :: Yes. :: No. :: I felt lectures were disorganized and confusing. :: No, we were suppose to get a project on the 11/4, and we didn't receive it for around 2 more weeks. :: meh. :: My biggest compliant his not being organized during class lectures, felt like class lecture was waste of time. Some class lectures were better than others. :: Not really. He constantly swaps between doing an example, showing a slide, and looking at the book. It leaves the audience confused because you are trying to take notes and have 3 different thought tracks clashing on the same page. :: No, there seemed to be no organization during lectures. Everything was rushed through, students weren't able to grasp concepts because we didn't do many in class examples at the end of the semester. He showed us solutions and posted them to pilot, but the group solving as a form of learning and note taking was not there. :: the course as a whole, yes we followed the book and each chapter section by section. Each individual lecture, no it was kind of unorganized and confusing at times. :: Relatively well. Some days it seemed like we jumped around a lot, or like there was not a plan for the day. He frequently had to look a student's notes in order to find out where we had left off the previous day. :: it would be charitable to call the lectures organized at all. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but looking back at his syllabus, it looks as if we ended up being about 4-5 weeks behind by the end of the semester."
2436,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: was always there for office hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, when I talked to him outside of class, he was extremely helpful. :: yes. :: Yes, during office hours he is able to explain things a lot clearer than class lecture. :: He seemed to answer emails fairly quickly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2437,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4150,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: altogether enjoyed the class and the professor. :: no. :: Good examples, but the problems were to long to demonstrate the concepts. Instead, I felt drowned by the unending deluge of steps to this twenty step problem. Yes the homeworks are that way, but to teach concepts it makes for a very confusing session. :: No. :: Dr. Mian is very bright in his field, but he has a hard time transferring this knowledge to students. He needs to work on how to present this knowledge. He seems to forget sometimes that students don't know the material. So he explains it quickly, and doesn't explain the equation or variables well sometimes. :: It is a lot of material to cover over design elements that don't necessarily relate to each other.  Easy to get confused. :: Homeworks were way too long. Most of them took upwards of 6 hours if you attempted to do them all. Most of these homeworks were long because of a problem requiring multiple iterations of page long processes. :: Don't give an exam that only 2 people in the entire class can finish in the allotted time. It is ridiculous to grade based upon the fact that the problems given require more than the class duration. :: difficult class, demanding material, confusing and unorganized its hard to learn skills necessary to completely and quickly solve problems with his kind of teaching. He is a generous grader and test giver with the exception of the bomb he threw on us for midterm 2 this semester. Great guy, just wish i learned more under his teaching. :: Write out relevant equations on the board! Work through examples on the board! Going over things like this on a projector is not helpful to me, and I can't think of any other student I've talked to that prefers projectors over whiteboards. :: The time it takes for exams, quizzes and home works to be graded and returned is measured in weeks instead of days. Equations written on the board are frequently wrong and posted problem solutions are typically unreliable. Attendance has been taken twice as of writing this survey. :: No. :: No. :: Thanks Professor"
2438,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good professor sometimes a little unorganized. :: He would do much better with more examples, I know the lab is supposed to take care of the examples but there is a definite disconnect between the two. He focuses too much on the derivation which isn't bad but, I treated it as math practice but I really struggled with trying to physically justify what he was trying to prove. Use more practical examples, its easy to use a super basic spring, damper, and mass configuration but I want be able to use this in the real world. :: Somewhat ineffective. The examples were laden with errors, making them difficult to follow. When the examples were done with minimal mistakes, the problems and concepts made sense. Otherwise, they were difficult to follow. :: He was not a very effective instructor. He often confused the whole class and himself at the same time. Assumptions were made in the examples but they were never explained. Then we were expected to replicate this using our own assumptions that we did not know how or why to make. :: I felt that lecture was at times confusing and disorganized. :: Dr. Mian was effective at teaching. He explained the topics well and provided the derivations for equations which I found was helpful. :: The instructor was not effective in teaching the subject. He did not explain what certain equation were used for. He would spend the whole class trying to solve different iterations of one equation that wasn't important to the class. He would also get equations incorrectly frequently. Many students started to ignore the notes, because the equations were wrong. One was even wrong in an exam that caused issues for students when taking it. He frequently paused to figure out problems or notes. He felt extremely unprepared for many classes. His notes were wrong frequently. :: Dr. Mian, does a good job of listening and being available for question during his office hours. He does fair job of grading exams and understanding his students.  He does however, struggle with explaining course content during his lectures.

2439,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- stuck with the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Sure. :: Yes. :: The expectations were laid out in the syllabus and followed exactly. :: Yes. :: Yes, he dose a good job in following the course syllabus. :: His partial credit seemed to be inconsistent. It depended on his interpretation of your work. :: Yes. Circling the incorrect area of a problem is much more helpful than writing ""-6"" on the top of a page or marking a slash through some general area.

We would end up having to wait 10 minutes again in the next class because he would write down the same constants a second time. :: This class almost always ran several minutes long. It's an 80 minute class that goes after 9pm, dude. You've been given enough time and you know we all want to get out of there. At least try to end on time. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2441,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- always invited us to office hours if we had questions. :: Asked for questions. :: Asked for questions and made documents at the request of the students. One of the best aspects of the course. :: I really don't know if he did. :: He answered questions. :: Dr. Mian did interest my learning. The topics were interesting and Dr. Mian was very knowledgeable. :: He showed some great knowledge in areas, but no effort in teaching it. Many parts of equations were incorrect. This lead to multiple important equations being represented incorrectly. :: He does care about his students and puts effort into talking to his students during office hours. :: He hosted a tutoring session before finals. :: Real-world applications were given for most chapters. :: by asking ""is it clear?"" regularly and sympathetically laughing when students emphatically say no. :: .. :: always kept on asking questions to see if we were learning. :: Asked frequently for feedback and questions. :: He made sure to explain everything as best as he could, and if anyone was confused, he would be sure to help them out. :: Always asking if there are any questions"
2442,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- communicated well. :: Good. :: The communication was fine. :: It wasn't very effective. :: He was available in office hours and by email. :: I did not communicate with Dr. Mian outside of class. In the classroom, the topics were explained well. When doing examples and derivations on the board, there were many mistakes in coping equations which caused much confusions on what was done or where it came from. Indicating a final step was a good idea. :: Communication was good. :: He was always available during office hours and always keeps his door open for students. :: He seemed to respond to emails fairly quickly. :: Very effectively. No confusion on when things were assigned or due. :: He was certainly efficient with his online communication, Homework for this class and Mech design 2 was frequently announced with identical emails sent hours to minutes apart from each other with a copy/pasted body along the lines of ""homework 2 posted"". :: good. :: always sending emails to update the class on future work. :: Very effectively. :: Very effectively. I liked how he emailed us whenever a new homework assignment or exam grade was posted. :: Ok, some initial confusion occationally but would always clarify"
2443,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- normally organised, but sometimes there were prolems. :: Good. :: Yes and no. The content overall was, but the lectures felt like they didn't relate to each other. When they did, the lectures were often so heavily theory focused that it became hard to follow. :: No. :: No, they felt scattered, and the examples were sometimes done incorrectly. :: The content and lectures were well organized and I had no problem in keeping up with the topics. :: No. Some lectures seemed to have pauses because he didn't have his notes organized. :: Organization of class lectures is my biggest complaint. The lectures were to disorganized and was always hard to follow him to take notes. :: In the beginning they were, but as the semester went on the lecture and the class became more and more disorganized. :: Yes, well organized. :: improvised might be a better word than organized. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but we ended up behind schedule. From the syllabus, we were supposed to start chapter 5 in Week 12, but we never got to it. He just briefly gave us an overview of that chapter on the last day of class. :: Yes"

2445,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- interesting class. :: The rotational imbalance section seems too vague, there are so many things that rotate I would have liked to have spent more time with this. :: My biggest complaint is the example problems. They tended to be very long, intensive problems with no actual quantities. While being raw variables isn't inherently a problem, the length of the examples exacerbated the issues. Because of this length, I often felt lost and forgot what was even being solved for. Add to this the number of errors made during the solving process, and the result is overall confusion. Simpler initial problems that don't take one hour to solve would be helpful. :: No. :: I would like to thank Dr. Mian for a great semester. :: He needs to learn how to be organized and prepared for classes. He knows the subject, but doesn't have any organization to his teaching to show that. Also, he needs notes to follow with equations shown correctly on them. Students shouldn't be expected to come to a class and be told incorrect formulas almost every day. :: The lab course was very disorganized, and it pertained very little to what we had learned in class. Also the professor didn't know anything about the scheduling or timing of the labs. :: Thank you!. :: I would rather have taken this class as an independent study. Reading the book an hour and a half two days a week and doing randomly selected book problems would have been a much better, easier, and more efficient way to learn the material. :: no. :: no. :: No. :: Nope"
2446,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not very. I never felt like what I learned in lecture helped in lab. The two felt completely disjointed until after the lab was turned in. :: The Lab Assistant that taught the class did well, but the material was very confusing since the material covered in the lab had very little to do with the lectures. :: The lab TA helped with any questions we had and tried to explain the reasoning behind the labs. :: Dr. Mian didn't go over any of the lab content. :: Very effective"
2447,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Yes
2448,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Class started on time and ended when the lab was completed. :: Yes. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Yes
2449,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Doesn't seem like an applicable question. :: He helped explain issues we had and other important parts of the lab. It helped show his interest in the lab. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Asked for questions. Would follow up on labs.
2450,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Pretty effectively. :: The Lab Assistant helped me to try and understand what was occurring in the lab. :: Communication was mostly good. We found out later that certain sections were sent emails with information about the lab, while others weren't even though it was general information about the lab. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Very effective"
2451,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. The whole course was very poorly organized, with due dates often feeling misleading. Having the lab split in two groups led to a lot of confusion for seemingly no reason. If this type of decision is made, it should be more clearly explained at the start of the semester. :: The Labs did not correspond with lecture. The equipment for the lab also rarely worked. :: It was well organized. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Yes"
2452,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes, the Lab Assistant was helpful and readily responded to emails. :: Yes, the TA was always open for questions over email. :: Nothing to do with the lab. :: Yes"
2453,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Connecting lab and lecture is a frequent problem for every lab I've taken, but this is probably the most extreme case of the two being disjointed. I often felt like I had no idea what was happening during the labs, let alone within the lab report. Especially since the lab directions were so small and not helpful. :: The lab required us to know material not discussed in lecture and use programming that had not been taught. The equipment in the lab also seldom worked. :: The labs were not well explained on the sheet and the website. The TA did all he could to explain it, but when going past that, it was poorly explained. This provided not understanding of the importance of the lab."
2454,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was not very effective at all in this lab. Easily the worst lab I have ever had in my life. :: It would be unfair to judge Dr. Mian for the Vibration Lab, as we never went over the lab in the Vibration class, though it would have been very helpful. The teaching assistant, Mackenzie, was effective at teaching this lab. She was thorough on explaining what to do. :: Overall effective, but confusing. The lab handouts were usually very unclear about what was being tested, the proper test procedure, what data needed to be gathered, and especially what needed to be analyzed in the report. Regarding the last point, a list of questions for the lab would be very helpful, instead of the current practice of having to pick questions out of a dense paragraph. :: awesome"
2455,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I'm not sure because I don't even know what the expectations were. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes
2456,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The TA always started on time and used the full amount. :: The lab was always started on time but rarely used the entire period. Most lab problems did not need the full time; however, the TA was available during the entire time. :: Yes. :: yes"
2457,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- None. There was no interest what so ever in this regard. :: The TA answered any questions I had and explained what would happen if the procedure was done differently. :: Before leaving the lab, the TA would ask several questions to confirm our understanding of the experiment that had just taken place. :: .."
2458,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication was lack luster. The schedule made no sense and was changed so many times. Communication outside of the class room was almost non existant. :: The TA explained answers to all my questions thoroughly. I did not ask out of classroom. :: Well. Quick to respond via email. However, TA could be difficult to hear in the lab. Speak up!. :: good"
2459,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. There was no origination for this lab at all. :: The order of the labs were well organized but the lab questions were not.  Most of the questions seemed incomplete or not understandable. I did not know what was being asked. The labs also required topics that were not covered in the Vibrations class at that time. I feel it would be better if the labs were discussed in the classroom. :: Moderately well. The lab handouts were usually very unclear about what was being tested, the proper test procedure, what data needed to be gathered, and especially what needed to be analyzed in the report. Regarding the last point, a list of questions for the lab would be very helpful, instead of the current practice of having to pick questions out of a dense paragraph. :: no"
2460,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The TA was available for office hours. :: I did not ask for office hours or appointments. :: Yes. :: yes"
2461,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- This lab. Oh man, this lab. Where do I even start with what is wrong with this lab. Let's start with the lab itself. When you get a lab manual that is half of one side of a piece of paper, and you are expected to write around a 10 or more page report AND a code that uses the data, you can't expect a whole lot of good things. But they did. I was never sure what I was doing or why in the lab. I'm not even sure if this lab was related to the class because of the disconnect in the material. I also had almost no idea what to do with the data after the lab was over. Thank god for the MATLAB codes that we had to find ourselves on Dr. Slaters website. If it wasn't for other students telling me this was available, I never would have found it and I would not have known how to write the code for the report. The TA I had was not the best at explaining what was expected out of the lab either, but the other TA was praised for this. Now let's talk about the structure of the class. Why on Earth would the labs be split in two groups for the same section and then spread throughout the semester? Couple this with the fact that the schedule was changed at least 4 times and you are left with a ton of confused students. When I tell other people about this lab, they laugh because they think I am joking. It is incredible that I pay money to go to this absolute shitshow of a lab. I recommend that you fix literally everything with this lab. :: I would like to thank the TA Mackenzie for a great semester. :: Please change the lab handout format to make exactly clear what is expected in the lab! The TA explained everything well, but after the lab you have to remember everything that was said, instead of referencing the handout. Also this posed problems because the TA was occasionally hard to hear. :: no"
2462,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- effective enough to run a lab well. :: teaching assistant was the instructor. :: a. :: N/A taught my TA
2463,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: the teaching assistant evaluated all the work as we were expected to do. :: Yes
2464,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: N/A taugh by TA
2465,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- the TA, did all the things good TA's do during labs. He provided a nice overview at the beginning, answered questions clearly and quickly, and he answered emails in a timely manner. :: he was helpful. :: N/A taugh by TA"
2466,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very effectively. :: always available. :: N/A taugh by TA
2467,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- the content wasn't organized, but I don't think that was the TA's fault and he definitely made the best of a bad situation. :: yes. :: N/A taugh by TA"
2468,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: very responsive. :: N/A taugh by TA"
2469,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- 10/10. :: no. :: Nope"
2470,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good lab. :: The TA was nice, very soft spoken. :: The TA for this lab was helpful, but I still feel like I didn't get a very good grasp of any of the material."
2471,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- followed syllabus. :: Yes the grading was clear. :: Yes
2472,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- the ta was late on occasion. :: He was late a few times, but other than that good. :: Yes"
2473,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- ta helped with lab and questions on the lab. :: The TA provided demos for the labs. :: The TA helped us throughout the lab and made sure we were getting good data.
2474,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- ta communicated well. :: He emailed us when needed. :: Pretty effectively
2475,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- it was organized well. :: Yes. :: It was kind of confusing because the lab dealt with chapters that were way ahead of the lecture. For example, some of the labs used chapter 7, and in class we only made it to chapter 4. This made it confusing because I had to teach myself the material without having the proper background knowledge."
2476,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- ta was normally only there for the beginning of the office hours. :: Yes I asked him a question once and he got right back to me. :: Yes"
2477,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 4210L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Good job. :: I think it would be best to explain the labs a little better. Overall, this lab was very confusing and time-consuming, and I felt like I learned next to nothing from this lab. The grader was very generous in his grading, however, which somewhat makes up for this."
2478,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- awesome. :: He is very smart Professor and I learned from him a lot of knowledge. :: He shows deep care and concern for his students.
2479,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Good. :: Yes. :: Has positive expectations for student success.
2480,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Good. :: Yes. :: Yes, He starts class on time and use the full class period."
2481,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- very precise. :: Actually, he has used different techniques to teaching us. :: He know what their students need to learn and spend much effort to make students understand."
2482,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good. :: Fantastic. :: He usually communicate effectively in and out of the classroom.
2483,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Very good. :: yes every thing was organized.
2484,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- very good. :: Yes he very helpful and on time. :: the instructor was reasonably available and responsive to my needs during office hours and on line."
2485,Akm Mian,2018 Fall,ME 8950,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I strongly support Professor like Mian. :: No"
2486,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Overall good instructor. :: Effective. :: Dr. Slater is a very smart guy and knows his stuff, but expects us to understand concepts faster than we can. I know other students feel the same way as I do when it comes to his classes. We went far too fast in lecture and were expected to be experts after class and reading the book. In class we would hardly touch the surface of a chapter and be expected to understand and complete very complicated homework. he was always available for help, but many of us have four to five other classes at the same time and work to worry about and don't have time to go see him every week outside of class which is needed to do well. :: good. :: Slater was very effective as the instructor of this class. :: Dr. Slater was extremely effective at teaching the material covered in the book. He took the info from the book and made it understandable and applied it to real world examples each class. :: Good"
2487,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Mostly. Syllabus needs updated to current class format. :: Yes. :: Went exactly by the syllabus, but we didn't receive a majority of our grades until around thanksgiving. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus guide for evaluation of work to a tee. :: Yes, grading expectations were very clear and more than fair. :: Yes"
2488,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, however, class often ran over. :: Yes. Sometimes tried to go over. :: Always started on time and always used a full class period, but would often get side tracked on random things that weren't needed. :: Yes. :: Yes and we often ran over due to the length of the material. :: Yes"
2489,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Making sure class understands content by asking questions during lecture. :: Continually saying that people who go to his office hours are doing better. :: Always wanted us to understand fully what he was saying and always made time outside of class for questions. :: Slater demonstrated a great interest in the students learning. On numerous occasions he emphasized the importance to him that we are learning and understanding so that we can apply these concepts in our future occupations. :: Always was available for extra appointments and answered any questions students had during the lecture. :: Always encouraged meeting outside of class for extra explanations.
2490,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Mostly good. Helpful to have good availability outside of class, but office hours seemed more like an expectation than just additional help if necessary. :: Very effectively. :: Very well, but not always on topic. I went to meet with him several times for help and spent most of the time he had available talking about random things. :: Very effectively, given his busy schedule. :: Very prompt on emails, all responses within 24 hours. Very clear during instruction. :: Well"
2491,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Some lectures were dragged out--such as the two individual free body diagram problems that took a whole class each. The class's lack of understanding should have been determined much sooner to further review while we were still on the topic. Probably should have followed notes or some kind of guidelines to keep each class on track, instead of rushing content at end of semester. It would be nice to cover a variety or more challenging examples in class. :: For the most part. :: Dr. Slater would have his notes with him, but almost never use them and would be all over the place. :: Yes. :: All content was updated frequently and the lectures were straight forward. :: He loosely follows notes and semi-freestyles his classes (please dont actually freestyle, because he probably would), but it works out well and overall the class is good."
2492,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. Provided more office hours than most professors and a useful tool to schedule meeting times outside of office hours. :: Available on line, but not so well in making appointments. :: Always made time for students. :: Yes. :: Had minimal office hours but made up for availability with appointments and very responsive through online communication. :: Yes"
2493,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Quizzes and homework were not returned in a timely manner. Homework over a topic was not returned before a quiz over same topic was given--seems like a double penalty if you think you understand the content, but don't. :: Great job teaching the class. I enjoyed the humor you used to make the class enjoyable. :: I have nothing against Dr. Slater other than the expected level of understanding. I hope to receive a B in the course, but am afraid of what the final will hold. I do understand most of the topics we cover, but I struggle with the level of difficulty of problems and have had to do a lot of self learning from the book that I don't have time for and gave up a lot of sleep for this course this semester. :: Dr. Slater was one of the better professors when helping students understand how things work instead of just throwing material at us to absorb. Related all concepts to real world applications that often he himself has worked on. :: He became a father figure to me over the semester. Now I just do not want to disappoint my new adopted dad. I hope his real kids do not get jealous of his students."
2494,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- -. :: Utterly disinterested in the running of this class or in performing his job, not that anyone at this ""school"" would care"
2495,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- -. :: Work was graded, though I doubt he did any of it"
2496,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- -
2497,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- No. :: Not at all
2498,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Not responsive. :: Ineffective, stupid idea to make the head of a department who doesn't care about the students he's in charge of to be the instructor for a distance class that shouldn't even be graded like this."
2499,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- -. :: Somewhat
2500,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- No."
2501,Joseph Slater,2018 Fall,ME 4940,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Reply to emails. :: If you are going to waste someones time with an exit interview that involves you trying to tell me how much you know about manufacturing and your life experiences as opposed to actually listening to what I had to say about my co-op, its better if you just don't even interview someone at all. Let someone else who might actually respect someone enough to listen to what they have to say give the interview, don't waste my time having to speak with your arrogance when you didn't want to write anything I said down until i ""got interesting to you"""
2502,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very well. :: Mr. Lawless was a very good lab instructor.  I think he could do a little bit better if he went over the basic math calculations for each step of the machining process either on the board or with handouts to explain step by step what we needed to do.
2503,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Not graded on any lab material. :: Yes, but the lab was not graded."
2504,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes
2505,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Taught us real world applications. :: He always demonstrated each step of the machining process so that we could see how each step was done.
2506,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. Sent emails and could be reached in a timely fashion. :: Very well within the classroom.  He also contacted us with email.
2507,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes
2508,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes"
2509,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I might have been easier if there was a lab packet explaining each step of our project and showing the simple math calculations."
2510,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: He is someone from industry who knows what he is doing. He does well of explaining things in a relevant simple way. :: Very effective. :: Excellent
2511,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- YEs. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Always

2513,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He helped walk us through each part we had to make. :: He was very eager to help when we expressed confusion. :: through demonstration, and answering questions. :: Helped out in and out of the class room"
2514,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Very well. :: effectively. :: Very well

2516,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: He took time out of his day after class to help with my senior design project."
2517,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Mr. Lawless is the type of person I love meeting in industry. He is so excited to share his experience with younger people and we are much better for it. :: no. :: Have this teacher teach the machining class. Dr. Lieh is not a good teacher."
2518,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good instructor. Clear lessons and helpful in lab. :: Knows his stuff and very good at what he does. :: Good. :: I don't think I could have had a better experience in a machining lab. Well done.

2521,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Provided practical information and helped individual students with differences there might be in each student's hammer. :: Always answered questions and was interested in our final products. :: Explained how to do every machining operation well and was always available for questions. :: Gave us the information that we needed and let us ask any questions that we may have while giving us the opportunity to experiment and learn from each step of the process. This is something I don't get to see very often. well done
2522,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Well. :: Likes to answer questions. :: Good. :: Gave us enough information to work with on a regular basis with enough time that if we had questions that we could still ask them.
2523,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes

2539,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes
2540,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes"
2541,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Good. :: not at this time"
2542,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. Quite helpful. :: The instructor did a good job of showing how to operate each machine. He gave a good baseline, but at the same time he could spend more time explaining the project. It would be beneficial if he would stay out in the lab as the first few students do their pieces because once that he would explain the lab for the day, a student that had prior experience would tend to have to help walk other students through the lab. He gave good baselines for learning the machines but he could definitely be more present for the students that have no prior experience with machining."
2543,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, the instructor told the lab the expectations he had from the very beginning and stood by these throughout the entire semester."
2544,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes, the instructor started class on time and would take the time that was needed to explain labs. He did not waste the students' time and used class period as needed."
2545,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He would answer any questions that you brought to him.

He would listen to questions and was willing to help if any problems came up."
2546,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor responded well to emails and communicated well in class too. He gave prior awareness of cancellations and reminders about labs as needed.
2547,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Very well organized!. :: Yes, each lab he was prepared to explain what was to be done in the lab that day. He provided good examples but could definitely take more time in explanation of certain parts of the lab."
2548,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The instructor was responsive through emails and was available outside of class time. I never tried to meet with him for office hours. He was very easy to set up meetings out of class and was understanding if you struggled to finish a piece for the overall lab."
2549,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Really appreciated being left to complete our own work after being shown what to do while still having him at our disposal. :: The instructor should try to go into more detail about explaining parts of the lab: how to actually read a micrometers, how to perform the measurements for the plate cutting with the mill, how to center the cutting tool on the lathe, programming the CNC Mill to cut out engravings. Especially for the measurements and engraving steps, he should consider having a procedure printed out to guide the students through the lab portions. These were the two main labs that a student had to walk almost every other student in the lab through how to do the calculations or programming. Updated blueprints of the parts would be beneficial too."
2550,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Great lab instructor. :: Very effective
2551,John Lawless,2018 Fall,ME 4870L,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes

Her goal seemed to be to have us understand as much as possible and she was willing to help students in any way that she could. :: Very much. :: yes very willing to talk through during class
2562,Hong Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4570,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- 9/10. :: Very. :: The professor did a great job of communicating in and out of the classroom besides posting homework on Pilot the days she said she would. She gave good guidelines over email and was available during office hours. For the homework, she would state she would post the homework and then would wait two days before actually doing so. This could cause students to have to rush to complete the assignments and not have the ability to submit the homework with the capability of asking questions beforehand. This is the main communication struggle that existed. :: Pretty effective. :: very well"
2563,Hong Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4570,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Extremely. :: The instructor had powerpoints prepared for every lecture. Her contents of were well organized and she knew the material that she was talking about each day. :: Yes. :: yes

Otherwise, I think that the instructor does a great job of teaching and knows her material very well. I would recommend her classes to other students due to her being an organized and knowledgeable professor. She challenged my knowledge and helped me learn some complex concepts. :: Great class. Amazing professor. Would highly recommend anybody to take it if they eye towards learning the material aspects of energy. :: I really liked the content of the class and the flow I wish I had a book to refer back to though."
2566,Hong Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4820,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective, taught the course incredibly well. :: Very effective. The examples and concepts were very well communicated and explained. :: Dr. Huang is an effective teacher, but she is very very very fast.  You cannot stop writing for a minute during each lecture or you will fall behind. There is a lot of information to deliver so I understand why she goes so fast, but it can be overwhelming. :: She was incredible effective. :: Great professor who had a very neat and clean teaching format. Showed definitions, concept, and plenty of examples. :: 8/10 with conveying the material to our brains. :: Dr. Huang helped me to understand and enjoy learning about Corrosion. :: I thought the overall effectiveness was great the class well well laid out and what was asked of us for the class was clear and easy to understand. :: Dr, Huang is an effective teacher and very knowledgeable about the material she taught. :: Very effective"

Dr. Huang is a great instructor. :: She asked us questions and adapted her teaching style to our progress in the class. :: Yes very much so. :: Encouraged us to research material of interest by facilitating presentations. :: She often asked if there were any questions, and took time to explain anything there was confusion on. :: We were given a series of presentations over various topics that we got to chose. During these presentations she was very interactive and made learning new topics more interesting than just listening to a lecture. :: There wasn't demonstrating of our learning. She had a plethora of examples and ensured that everyone contributed to the best of their ability."
2570,Hong Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4820,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Available through email and in her office. :: yes. :: Well. :: Very effective. :: Very well. :: 9/10. :: Dr. Huang communicated effectively in class and sent emails to give the class information. :: She communicated very well and was able to let us know in advance if there was a change in the schedule or an important note to be added to something. :: Dr. Huang communicated very effectively. :: very well.

Sometimes there is not enough time to write down notes before they are erased. :: I thoroughly enjoyed this class. :: She is an amazing professor and one of the best I've ever had. The only down side of her teaching is she is extremely fast. Sometimes people find it difficult to follow due to the racing pace. However if you don't leave her class learning a year's worth of material, you failed to pay attention."

2582,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 3350,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Zifeng is great. He has pretty clear notes and is a great lecturer. I do wish his class was a bit more challenging, though. :: Very fast paced, but needs to be for the amount of content we were getting through. :: good. :: Dr. Yang was an effective instructor, knows the material well. :: Effective. Knows what he's talking about and presents class material in a relatively reasonable format. Sometimes Dr. Yang skips over small details important to the topics at hand; I also feel like homework didn't always line up with the in-class examples, especially toward the end of the semester, and I was left guessing what approach to use and what equations to choose. Hard class for us, but it also looks like a hard class to teach. :: Great instructor. :: Fairly effective. :: Hard to understand what he was saying sometimes. not enough examples for such a tough class. :: Very intelligent and can explain things in a way that makes it very easy to understand. :: Dr. Yang was a great professor.  I liked his way of teaching but he sometimes skipped over the small details.  These details may not have seemed important to him but they are crucial for an undergraduate student who is learning the topic for the first time. :: Dr. Zifeng was an excellent instructor. He is one of my favorites at the university. :: effecetive. :: Zifeng's handwriting is very small. It is difficult to see from the front middle rows. He didn't give enough time to how the equations are used. He took a little too much time on the theory. When it came to the homework, I struggled because I didn't know how to use the equations. :: Good. :: OK. :: He did a great job explaining the derivations, but lacked in amount of examples that involved actual values. He did a lot of purely symbolic examples although. :: Some issues with the difficult material, but effective in general. :: Not very Effective, learned more from the book. Made a difficult subject worst."
2583,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 3350,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, Sometimes I even felt like I was given more credit than I deserved in the partial credit. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. The exam was much harder than that expected of the in class work and homework. I don't think we were prepared enough for that level of difficulty. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes they did. :: YES. :: yes. :: yes"

2585,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 3350,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Always answering questions and giving us bonus quizzes to make sure we're grasping the material throughout the semester. :: I went up and asked him questions and he always answered with a useful answer. :: There was no demonstration of interest in my learning. :: Bonus quizzes help a lot. They give me a sense that I know what I'm doing - and if they don't, I know specifically what I need to work on. :: Available to answer questions. :: Hand written notes instead of slides. :: Explained any confusing topics. Set up a recitation after most of the class did very poorly on the midterm. :: Dr. yang answered most questions asked in class.  Dr. Yang did show some frustration when answering certain questions though. :: Dr. Zifeng was willing and available to answer any questions during and outside of class. He created a recitation after students in the class requested it. :: Many great examples. :: Answered all questions. :: There wasn't really much interest in my learning. He came in and made sure to cover all the material he needed to, but there wasn't any checking on how well we grasped the material. :: Yes they did. :: -"
2586,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 3350,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Fine. :: He was very responsive when I needed him to be. :: His communication was well both in and out of the classroom. :: Very well. :: Fairly effectively. :: Good. :: good. :: communication was perfect. :: Well. :: Effective, answered questions and emailed. :: he made sure we always had enough time to do the homework. :: Somewhat effectively. :: Wasn't good at breaking down concepts of fluid dynamics. Did example problems but didn't do a good job at explaining steps. :: Good"
2587,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 3350,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes, we made it through all of the content just like the syllabus planned. :: Yes, the class went in order of the textbook. :: Mostly. They felt scattered and like they left out some explanations or other details, but they usually made sense after reading and looking the notes after lecture. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. The course was very easy to follow and the material flowed from one thing to another very easily. I like that he has his own set of notes and doesn't explain word for word from the textbook. :: Yes.  Dr. yang used notes which were also posted online. :: The lectures were extremely well organized and Dr. Zifeng knew the material extremely well. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes it was. :: YES. :: No. :: yes"

It was a bit easy for a traditional fluid mechanics class. :: Great professor, good class, useful subject. :: Dr. Yang kept the material well organized, however, he seemed frustrated when students were still confused on some topics and Dr. Yang wanted to move on. :: Final being worth 50% seems a bit much, especially since the last 1-2 chapters are the most difficult. Would appreciate a second midterm exam partway through the semester. Overall, great instructor, and good job teaching some difficult material. :: No. :: reviews were not helpful. needed more examples to learn from for such a tough class. :: Great professor. Wish I had more like him. :: Dr. yang is great but the grading for the class is a little wonky.   Fluids is a tough subject so to put so much weight on the final sucks.  I would have liked to see more points go to quizzes or make another midterm.  He also needs to learn to write bigger on the board. :: I feel I have learned a lot from this class and the material was presented in a way that made me interested. :: could use more review. :: Nice easy quizzes for bonus points. :: Overall he was a good professor, id give him a 6.5 out of 10. Just make sure to check on student comprehension. :: None at this moment. :: Class average on first exam was 55% which is ridiculous and there was no curve. :: No. :: -"

2593,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 7300,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Tailored the course content to his own research experience so that he could give his special topics lectures a lot of real-world context and complexity. Spent time going over many concepts just to make sure we had a broad understanding of higher-level fluid dynamics phenomena that are not always covered. :: he demonstration help us improve our interest to learn new things
2594,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 7300,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: was so helpful both in and out the classroom. :: He explains very clearly both in and out.

2597,Zifeng Yang,2018 Fall,ME 7300,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I would strongly suggest a different book be used in the future - every reputable fluid dynamics course uses the Frank White book for a reason. The book chosen (by Graebel) is full of errors (which Dr. Yang must continuously correct) and, in my opinion, is unclear. I do not know why or how this book got chosen, but it has been an issue every semester it has been used and should be changed. Why are we (the students) being asked to spend time and money trying to understand a book that is full of errors?. :: the best professor whom I took classes under. :: He assumed everyone was on the thesis track, and taught accordingly."
2598,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Professor Bae was very effective despite the slight language barrier. :: Pretty effective in his teaching--very clear and concise. :: He was a great teacher. He used many examples and gave good feedback in class. :: Dr. Bae was very effective at teaching the subject of FEA. The in class examples were very helpful in the completion of the homework and the exams. The way he explains the examples is also very helpful, as most of the time he goes through in a step-by-step process. :: I learned a lot from Bae's teaching even though I work in the FEA world everyday.  Good and effective professor.  Only downfall is the accent.  Cannot tell the difference in pi and phi when he says them, this can be confusing during lectures. :: Good. :: Dr. Bae was a great instructor! I thoroughly enjoyed his class due to his great teaching. I learned the most in FEA than I did in the combination of all my classes this semester. :: Dr. Bae did a fairly good job of teaching the material. His lectures were presented well and he did lots of examples. The only problem I had was that many of his examples were only partly done by hand. The latter portions of problems were done using matlab making it hard to follow how to perform them on exams (where matlab couldn't be used). :: Dr. Bae is effective in passing the information across to his students. :: Good. :: Very effective and knowledgeable. :: Very effective, though the grading seemed fairly harsh. :: Dr. Bae is a very effective instructor and may be my favorite instructor I have had. He is very effective in what he teaches and he makes sure he conveys the subject in a way that can be easily understood. :: Dr. Bae is an effective instructor. He knows his subject really well and does a good job at making it understanding despite that FEA is a very hard subject. :: Dr. Bae did well teaching this class, I enjoyed and understood the material. :: Dr. Bae is very effective. He uses practical examples and the course progression is logical. :: Dr. Bae was a very effective teacher. He tried to cover all the details and explain every part so that students could understand the material. He also provided files online that he used in class. :: very good-. :: He is very professional. :: Harok Bae does a good job during his lectures. He does a good job in explaining tough concepts.  I do believe students would understand certain concepts better if he would use example problems that did not depend on matlab so much since you cannot use matlab on the exam.  I also think if he  would provide exam review before each exam and provide questions in the same format as his exam. He did talked about topics that would be on each exam but its helpful to provide an old exam or do a walk through on certain problems.  Overall, I really enjoyed Dr. Bae and would recommend him as a professor. :: Dr. Harok Bae is my second favorite professor. I've failed Finite Element Analysis before, but I was only able to continue my engineering career because of how understanding Dr. Bae is towards students with disabilities. Dr. Bae posts excellent notes online and the book provided does an ok job of explaining steps in a different way  During Class Dr. Bae is more than willing to answer questions from students. Dr. Bae is a great professor. :: Very effective aa highly dynamic, and motivated individual, with no observable shortcomings in the classroom.   In class examples were extremely useful, ended up being a life saver in terms of preparing for tests, . Concepts were presented in such a way anyone can understand, even if you are having difficulty following lecture, his notes are set up so that on your own time, you can go through an example problem step by step at your own pace.  Dr. Bae was extremely accommodating,  for one exam he even personally worked with ODS to secure a test proctor so that my accommodations through ODS could be met.  Overall a very good professor, I found it inspiring to have the opportunity to study under such a high caliber instructor, and wish that I could have had Dr. Bae as the instructor for some of my previous classes. :: He was very effective and taught the information well. :: Good instructor. Taught well. One of the best Instructors I've had. I thought the language barrier would an issue, but it was not. :: Very effective, lecture method was extremely easy to follow and expectations for the exams were very clear. :: Fairly good instructor. Sometimes goes on unnecessary tangents. :: Taught it in a way that was generally understandable. :: He is a wonderful standard professor, I'm not big on learning in lectures. I study best when trying to teach myself the subject. I would say that the book could be better. :: Very effective. Confusing at first but the topic is a tough one to grasp initially. He outlined steps to problems very clearly, however his thick accent sometimes made it difficult to understand some things. After a few weeks, it was not an issue and he did a very good job at teaching this difficult course. :: He was a very effective professor. There were a few times when he taught from pre-written notes that had been scanned in and shown on the projector. These notes were sometimes cluttered and messy. This made the notes hard to follow on a few occasions. Other than that one fact, I learned a lot from this professor. There were times when his homework was not due for a couple weeks after it was assigned. This philosophy of late due dates led to us not being able to have a homework assignment over the last set of lessons. However, he did give us a list of questions to work on for the last set of lessons which was great. :: Overall effective. :: Dr. Bae was very effective. He communicated the material well with notes and examples. :: Dr. Bae went over the material at a fair pace and was very willing to go the extra mile and help students understand the topics covered in class by thoroughly answering any questions. :: very effective. :: Ineffective.  he resorts to solving problems with MATLAB Mathematica and other such programs rarely if ever solving one fully by hand to spite the fact we are expected to. He also requires an outdated text that has no solutions. in other words we must teach ourselves with resources not provided by the university to spite the absurd amount we paid for the class. :: Good. :: good. :: Very high. :: Dr. Bae was very effective.  He presented the concepts clearly and logically. :: Good teacher, tries to engage with students. :: Dr. Bae is a pretty good professor overall. He is definitely a good guy; he always attempts to answer students' questions thoroughly, and is responsive to the class. The material was conveyed clearly for the most part. Sometimes I felt confusion jumping back and forth between the online notes and the written examples. Other than that, no major complaints. :: Good. :: He was much more effective at teaching the first two sections of the course than the last one. The last one did not seem like it was as interesting to him, so he blew right through it. We spent the first two exams on about 6 chapters, and then went through another 5 or 6 chapters in just a few weeks. It was very difficult to keep up with what was going on. Dr. Bae explained this material as if we already knew everything. He would ask us questions as if the answers were obvious, and didn't seem to mind if we did not understand or know the answer."
2599,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- all expectations were clearly defined and followed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, the work was evaluated based upon the expectations of the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes he stuck to the syllabus. :: Yes. He was very straight forward with his expectations at the beginning of the semester. He followed the syllabus throughout the system, remaining on time. He also stuck to his class rules. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He was very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Overall, i felt like he did grade fairly. Exam 1, labs, and homework i felt were graded fairly. I did feel like the grading on exam 2 was much tougher despite that i felt like i did very well on it. I had most of the process correct on some of the problems but inputted wrong values and received no points for it, despite showing some understanding. Other than that, he evaluated well. :: Yes. :: Yes, the grades were fair and followed the syllabus. :: Yes, we were evaluated off of the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes, he did. :: Yes, he followed the course syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, his exams were very clear about where each point value came from. The questions were straight forward and if points were taken off it was very clear where and why. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yep. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, sometimes he graded a bit harshly, but at least he was fair in grading the same way for everyone in the class if they made the same mistake. :: He did evaluate us on the expectations described in the syllabus. However, I felt like the exams were far too easy for the class seeing as the class is a 4000-Level course. The exams should have been either longer or harder to match the difficulty of the course level. :: Yes. To the letter. I did not have confusion with any evaluation remarks. :: Yes all assignments and grades were given per the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: what expectation? he provides nor examples no such rubric. there is absolutely no standard at which to determine what all we needed to do to satisfy him. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I am not sure. :: He followed the syllabus well enough, no complaints there. :: yes. :: Yes."
2600,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- he always used the entire time period and even ran over to make sure students understood the material. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class time was always used effectively. Class always started on time and the full period was used. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was always on time and finished class either on time or a couple minutes over when something was extremely important. :: Yes. :: He uses his class time perfectly. :: yes. :: Always used the full amount of time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae was to close to being on time to class all the time, and always used the full class period unless he felt like it wasnt necessary. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was always prepared to start immediately when class began and he always ran right to the last minute. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, He was always started class on time and available after class for question. :: Yes. :: Dr, Bae is a very punctual instructor, and actually usually showed up to class a few minutes early, to allow time to answer students questions before lecture began, and never failed to utilize the full duration of lecture. :: Yes, he started class on time every day and he utilized it fully each day. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yep. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He started on time everyday and used all of the class time everyday. :: Yes. Always started right on time and used the full period. :: Yes, class always started on time and if we finished early he allowed time for questions, more examples, or worked ahead to the next section. :: Yes, class time was used very well. :: yes. :: Yes. This I can say positively about him. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class time was used completely. :: yes. :: Yes."
2601,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he would always ask the students if they understood and took extra time to explain when necesary. :: He made sure that everyone understood the material, and he answered any questions to the best of his ability. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was very helpful if you asked questions and he was helpful in his office hours as well. He made sure that you understood the material being discussed. :: Always tried to make sure that everyone followed what he was doing before moving on. :: He posted the examples done in class that day. :: He continued to ask questions through out class making sure every one was following and understanding the material. He was extremely helpful when answering questions in class and through email. :: Dr. Bae was in his office every time I went to ask questions and was always willing to help. :: He's willing to help to student succeed. :: yes. :: He always asked the class to make sure the class knew what was going on during the lecture. :: Posted files to pilot, in depth examples, etc. :: He showed genuine interest in our learning and was able to adapt a problem to answer any questions we had. :: Dr. Bae did a good job at walking through practice problems and his notes in a speed that helped the understanding of FEA to his students despite his subject being hard. Him walking through problems and showing all steps multiple times helped my learning. :: He would make sure the class understood concepts that were being struggled with. :: Dr. Bae answered all of my questions to the best of his ability and tried to ensure that I understood each concept. :: He always sounded enthusiastic about the subject and finished the year going over some stuff that we didn't learn that future classes teach. This was mainly for the software involved in FEA. :: yes. :: Dr. Bae  made class room interesting and always engaged with his students. :: Dr. Bae provided well structured notes online to help with understanding of material, which is one resource I used daily. :: During the lab section, he taught us how to use every feature of ANSYS software, and allowed us to use ANSYS to perform an analysis of our choice, of a model or system of our choice.  Dr. Bae also routinely used class time to demonstrate using finite element analysis methods in software such as matlab to solve real world problems that we may encounter in industry.  Dr. Bae went beyond simply covering the basics outlined in the syllabus, he went out of his way to prepare us for graduate school, the workforce, and beyond. :: He was always willing to answer questions and was always willing to post the notes and matlab files for us to use. :: He wanted to make sure we utilized all of the lecture time provided and routinely involved us with MATLAB coding. :: Answered questions when asked. :: Would consistently ask if he was going too fast and would look at our reactions when covering topics to see if we were understanding or just confused. :: He didn't, I often felt confused during lecture and kept to the text on my own, and that seemed to be easier. :: He did his best to try and answer any questions students had throughout class and in office hours. :: He showed interest by giving multiple examples of how to use the topic we were talking about. :: Most students in the class, including me, find example problems to be the most helpful. Many examples were worked through for each chapter that was lectured on. :: He held consistent office hours, stayed after class to answer questions, and routinely asked if everyone was understanding during class. :: Dr. Bae made it very clear that he was willing to meet with students at any time to help with any questions or concerns that they may have had. :: by regularly engaging with the classroom during lectures to ensure students stayed engaged through what was often very dry material. :: He did not. Following a spiel about how he is not available for help do not walk into his office even if he is there he reinforced the overall tone he demonstrated of having no concern for the students. :: Good. :: .. :: By creating exams that tested our understandijg of the material and not just tests for the sake of testing us. :: He presented many examples about how the concepts he was teaching about were applicable in industry and technical work. :: He appeared very enthusiastic about the topics. :: Dr. Bae was always good about showing examples in multiple forms. For example, he did beam and thermal problems, by hand, by Matlab, and by Mathematica. He provided these codes for our use as well, which was very helpful. :: yes. :: See answer to the first question. I felt he was more interested for the material from the first two exams than the material after exam 2."
2602,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very prompt. :: Pretty effectively. He kept us up to date on the assignments, and he graded tests fairly quickly. :: He did a great job. :: Dr. Bae was very helpful if you asked questions and he was helpful in his office hours as well. :: effective. :: Good, he would email us if needed. :: He communicated perfectly. :: Fairly well. I would say 7/10. :: His communication outside class is good.. :: good. :: Responsive to email, and available after class. :: Very effectively. :: He was a very effective communicator. :: Dr. Bae communicated well in class, and answered questions to the best of his abilities when asked. I didnt contact him outside the classroom this semester, but i know from a friend that he will meet with you if you have to. :: He communicated very well in class, making sure the class understood the material. :: Dr. Bae was extremely quick to reply and went above-and-beyond when it came to giving homework recommendations when I hit a road block. :: Communication was strong. Always told us everything we needed to know. :: good. :: Dr. Bae, did excellent job in listening to his students and didn't make students uncomfortable in asking questions. :: Dr. Bae was eager to draw questions from students and makes sure that students are paying attention and learning. :: His communications are always punctual, straight forward, easy to understand, and highly efficient. :: He answers emails very quickly and was always willing to answer any questions you may have. :: Well. :: Very well. :: Rarely through email. Mostly communicated via pilot. When done that way, things easily can get lost. Would rather he used email. :: Very well!. :: Told you want was needed in a timely manner. :: pretty well. :: He was communicating well in class. Out of the classroom he was a little ineffective in communication because the homework was posted in a Pilot news message instead of as a content entry like other professors, so there was a chance we could have accidentally deleted the homework assignments. :: Very effectively. :: Dr. Bae provided great notes and posted assignments and all class announcements on the online portal, Pilot. :: Dr. Bae was taught the material to the best of his ability and would often send out notices regarding homework or class in e-mails. :: very effectively. :: Mediocre at best. He conveys a portion of a problem well then resorts to code most of us can not follow along with on the fly so he looses all of us. I have spoken to many classmates all I have are annoyed by the MATLAB solutions. :: Good. :: well. :: Very well. :: He communicated effectively and was very prompt on Pilot posts. :: Very. :: Concepts were conveyed pretty well. :: very. :: Dr. Bae is difficult to understand at times. He also has very bad handwriting, and writes extremely small on top of that. The material on the board is not able to be read if you are sitting past the 2nd row. In the future, I would not recommend drawing on the whiteboard on top of the projected notes. That just becomes extremely difficult to understand and is not easy for students to make notes on top of the class notes."
2603,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- he always had a clear linear thought process and progression through the material. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes the course was organized very well, with a gradual increase in the difficulty of the material. :: yes.  Actually finished the material for the course unlike a lot of other instructors. :: Very good, chapter by chapter. :: Yes, the content seemed to flow together nicely. This is extremely helpful considering the material kept building up on itself. :: Yes. :: Yes, he organized the course content very well. :: yes. :: Was very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Bae's lectures and notes mostly to always tied to one another. He didnt jump topics that had no relation. The stuff we learned at the end of the semester have similar properties to the stuff learned at the beginning, proving that he was well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes, the lecture is organized in a way that creates a strong foundation for the subsequent content. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: The course content and lectures was organized for the most part.  It was sometimes hard to read the white board when he was using it for notes.  I felt most confused when using Matlab for example problems at first and its hard to take information from the matlab code and reorganized it into a format to use for studying for exams. :: yes. :: yes, each class period had a definitive purpose, built off the material of the previous lecture, and laid the foundation for understand material to be covered in the next lecture. :: Yes, it followed his notes very closely and he posted them ahead of time, which was very helpful with following along with this difficult content. :: Yes, very. :: Extremely. :: Mostly. :: Yes. :: Yes, given the book. :: yes, just kind of confusing content sometimes. He posted alot on Pilot as supplemental material to help ease confusion. :: There were moments in the class where the notes were a little disorganized like explained above but there were other moments where the class was pretty organized. Near the end of the semester we had a few classes where we flew through like Four Chapters in three classes. These would have been a little better to have had a few more examples like all of the other chapters where we had many examples even after the class had understanding. :: Yes. The syllabus was followed exactly. :: Yes, you could tell he had well prepared lesson plans for each lecture that kept us on schedule and on task. :: Yes, however bouncing back and forth between the notes on the whiteboard and the written notes on the projector was a little confusing at times. :: yes. :: Well. enough. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes very much so. :: Yes. :: Lecture notes could be more organized. :: I found the PDF online notes to be somewhat confusing. I believe that most of this came from the fact that we would visit these notes for a couple minutes at a time, leave to do example problems, and then just jump right back in. I feel I may have benefited more from a straight theory section at the beginning, followed by examples worked straight through. :: yes. :: His notes are hand-written and very hard to read. A print out would be very helpful."
2604,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- when needed he was available. :: yes. :: I never needed to make an appointment outside of his allotted office hour, but he was available if you needed him. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I never tried to contact him outside of class but in class he always seemed readily available to talk or answer any questions his students had. :: Yes. Always. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Was available through email. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never had to use the office hours, but I had a friend that needed and appointment and he met with him fairly quickly. Sent emails and notifications when needed. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bae was always available. :: Yes, I emailed him out of class and got an answer back quickly. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he always responded very quickly to emails. :: Yes. :: Yep. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I never went to office hours or asked for assistance on line. :: Yes. :: Yes, I visited his office hours once and he was available. I missed one lecture due to illness and he worked with me to get me caught up. :: Yes. :: yes. :: If we made appointments well in advance. I don't Honestly know he told us we had to make appointments well in advance if we could not make office hours honestly the indifference almost hostile feeling I sensed from him made me unwilling to even try to make an appointment. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He responded well to emails."
2605,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- bae was great. :: Keep up the good work!. :: The labs for FEA need to be improved. The ANSYS software is several generations behind. :: N/a. :: Good Professor.  Wish there were more like him in the engineering department. :: Thank you for the good semester. :: Dr. Bae was the best professor I had this past semester. I truly feel like I learned a lot within his class. I hope I am able to take one of his classes again!. :: No.  I enjoyed the class more than I thought I would. :: no. :: Very good course. I enjoyed it a lot. :: No. :: Thank you Dr. Bae!. :: My only issue with the class is MATLAB. When we started doing problems that were so complicated that we had to use MATLAB, I started to fall behind because I didn't have nice notes to follow on the homework. Additionally, Dr. Bae goes a little too quickly when using MATLAB, so following on my laptop is very challenging. I also have no clue how to use Mathematica so those lectures were wasted on me. :: Overall, everything was great about the class. The only recommendation that I have is with using MATLAB. I feel like if Dr. Bae used the section ability to run certain sections of his code instead of copying and pasting it into the command window quickly, it would be easier to follow. This would help students understand what he is putting in the code, and what sections he is running. :: no. :: no. :: Grading of certain homework's for matlab. I thought some of the grading for the homework was little unfair with asking for matlab code.  I had points taking off on problems when using matlab code, because I answers the questions from the book, but he was looking for additional answers.  If he chances to problem or asking for additional information he needs to state that information on pilot.  I also think communication between the professor and the TA might of been the issue.  Like I said before Dr. Bae is good professor and the course content isn't that easy. :: nope. Other than that I plan on acing the final. Finite Element Analysis is the only thing I study right now. And I've been improving my study habits. :: Dr. Harok Bae is a living breathing example of what every other professor within the department should aspire to, and fully exemplifies all the properties of an exceptional educator. :: I would recommend him as a professor. He taught a difficult class with very intensive content, but I found it was one of my most enjoyable classes because the homeworks were reasonable, the lecture was easy to follow, and his tests were similar to what we had done in the class. :: -. :: I want my extra credit. :: I found it extremely helpful to walk through an ENTIRE problem with the professor writing out each step and performing each calculation by hand. Sometimes if steps were skipped or he started to use the online notes to get his point across, it would confuse me and made it a bit harder to grasp the concept. :: Good professor. :: hard class, tough but fair grader. Did a reasonably good job at teaching a difficult subject and making it as easy to understand as he could. :: He was a relatively good professor with a few fixable problems. :: Thank you for your efforts this semester! I feel like I actually learned a lot. :: Dr. Bae was a great professor. He seemed very knowledgeable about FEA and other topics. I liked that he try to be funny from time to time and that helped keep everyone's attention. I would recommend taking classes with Dr. Bae. :: My singular complaint is that Professor Bae's handwriting was often too small to read from even the second row of seats, subscripts were often difficult to read. :: He is respectful when you talk to him. But he is extremely poor at teaching as he does not provide enough material nor complete solutions to properly prepare you to complete the tasks needed to pass. Nor does he seem enthusiastic about teaching but does obviously know and have a passion for FEA. :: No. :: no. :: No. :: No. :: Dr. Harok Bae cares about his subject, and he cares about his students. There may be some minor flaws in his teaching methods, but these facts help make the class much more enjoyable than others. :: no"
2606,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good. :: He wasn't in charge of the lab but the lab TA was really effective. :: He was a very effective instructor. :: Dr. Bae is an effective instructor. He knows his subject very well and does a nice job to make it possible for us to understand. Very nice guy too, and always seem to find a way to make us laugh. :: somewhat effective. :: He is very professional. :: The labs were a little ineffective due to us not actually learning how to use the software. We just followed along with the lab instructions without really learning how to use the software. Also, some of the concepts in the lab we hadn't learned about yet in the class, so we were slightly confused about the concepts. :: Lab TA's effectiveness was poor. Very difficult to hear and understand. Questions were not answered in any meaningful way. I sort of learned ANSYS but my understanding of FEA was not expanded in a significant way. :: Dr. Harok Bae was very effective in teaching FEA because of all of the examples and expanding on the theory of the material. :: very. :: Ineffective he rarely if ever solves an example to completion in class resorting to MATLAB or Mathematica to solve it which in no way helps us get to the point of hand solving on his tests that do not allow the use of such modern developments but rely on processes by hand no longer used.   In no way is he useful as an instructor. :: Good. :: ok. :: I think there should have been more context behind the labs to provide a deeper understanding of what we were doing. It felt like we were just following a procedure and printing results."
2607,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes he kept to the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did for the most part. I thought he graded the first exam very fairly, but the second exam was graded much tougher (or i felt). Other than that, i felt that the homework and labs were graded well. :: yes. :: The requirements for the Lab Reports were inconsistent from what the syllabus described. The syllabus described nothing about he format for the question section, so most students thought the answers were supposed to just be written like a report in a paragraph but points were taken off for not writing the answers in a list. :: Yes, but the template that we were to follow for lab reports was not clear. We did not find out until the third week of lab that you must have a separate title page (which was not specified in the template, AND the template did not have a separate title page). The same goes for a diagram of the problem in the problem description. This was not specified in the syllabus until the third week of lab. :: Yes, all work / grades were given per the syllabus. :: yes. :: what example? he never set a clear guide line as what to expect or how he wanted us to do it nor prior tests no prior homework. In fact study material appropriate for the test is non existent he insists on a book decades old that had to have been ineffective when it was made it does not provide step by step solved examples or processes just overall governing equations not applied. :: Yes. :: maybe. :: Yes."
2608,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes he did. :: Yes. He managed the class time wisely. :: Yes. :: Yes, he always to class very close to on time and always used the whole period. :: yes. :: yes. :: The lab section could be started whenever we were there because the lab instructions were already on Pilot. The Lab TA had information written on the whiteboard that wasn't necessarily needed for the lab so we didn't really even need to go to the lab section except to pickup our lab reports from the previous week. The labs also did not take the entire lab time to complete. I usually finished within 30-45 minutes into the lab section. :: Yes. :: Yes, class always began on time and if we finished early Dr. Bae would allow time for questions, explain further, do another example problem, or work ahead on the next section of material. :: yes. :: yes. this is probably the only thing I can say positive about the instructor. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
2609,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Gave us that lab. :: Perfect. :: He had interest. :: Dr. Bae did a good job at doing examples and going over them very slowly so that his students understood the content. This was great since you dont want to just talk about topic A and and move onto topic B without everyone having some sort of understanding of topic A. :: yes. :: We were allowed to complete a project about any topic we wanted. The lab helped my learning a little, however the labs were just confusing because we hadn't learned some of the material yet. :: Honestly, the Lab TA did not demonstrate much interest in our learning outside of showing up on time and giving a vague description of what was already laid out in the lab handout. :: Dr. Bae would always ask if everyone understood what he was explaining. He held established office hours and would stay after class to answer any questions. :: by quickly and kindly answering questions about the lab. :: No. he never made me feel as though my learning was important to him, just that if I had trouble I needed to figure it out or fail. to be honest preventing cheating is obviously far more important to him than educating. lecturing about ids at tests making us say our name on a video recording (he learned no ones name, or at least never called any of us by their names in class). he never offered to prep for tests never offered old exams nothing indicated an interest in teaching us from my point of view. :: Good. :: .. :: The lab TA was very helpful when we had questions about the lab."
2610,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good he posted the examples he did in class that day. :: He's effective with in class communication, but less effective with outside. I emailed him regarding few things and he only emailed me back once. :: Very effective. :: He gave us the option to email him and from there he would schedule appointment to meet with him. I had a friend do this and he met with him over his issue, so I would say that he was effective in caring about students needs. :: middleing. :: It was a little on and off. :: Lab TA's communication was poor. Difficult to hear and understand in the classroom. Emails were very sparse. :: Dr. Bae provided great notes and explanations of the material. He would regularly post notes, assignments, lab material, and announcements on the online platform, Pilot. :: very. :: Not well. He made it clear that his time is far more valuable than ours and that we needed to set appointments with him well in advance. adding to the exact contrary of my Mech 2 teacher if I am in my office and it is not hours do not enter are expect me to talk to you. :: Good. :: ok. :: Sometimes it is hard to understand what he is saying- it would be helpful if he could talk a little slower and write neater."
2611,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, until the end it was very rushed. :: I will give him a 100% on this. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was organized and didnt have his topics all jumbled together. They all kind of ""fed"" into one another, or they flowed well. :: no. :: yes. :: The content was well organized but should have started later in the semester and ended at the end of the semester to correspond more with our learning. :: Yes. The labs were fine, the TA did not seem at all organized though. :: Yes, you could tell that Dr. Bae had prepared lesson plans with notes and knew exactly what he wanted to cover each class meeting. :: yes. :: Well enough. :: Yes. :: yes. :: For the most part- printed notes would be helpful."
2612,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I never had to contact him outside of class, but i know he was available when he was needed. Big believer in office hour meetings. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never checked. :: I did not use any of these. :: I only had to attend office hours once, but he was there an available. I missed class once due to an illness and he worked with me to help me get caught up. :: yes. :: To be honest after his lecture about how important his time was on day one that made me feel like I did not matter I never bothered with appointments. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
2613,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Thank you for the good semester. :: No. :: Thank you Dr. Bae!. :: If the lab is going to be all ANSYS, I think that is the program you should use to illustrate teachable topics in class, instead of MatLab or Mathematica.  Or, if you are going to use Matlab in class, that should be the basis of the lab.  Tying the in-class use of a program to teaching points would be more effective than struggling to learn a new program without a clear idea as to how it relates to the material. :: In the first lab, Castigliano's Theorem was asked for. This concept was taught in Mechanical Design I. However, that class is not actually required to take Finite Element Analysis, so either Castigliano's Theorem should have been discussed in the lab or not have been asked about. :: It would be helpful if the lab lined up with what was being lectured on. There was a large gap and it was hard to make connections. I understand that this is a problem with all labs, though. :: I felt that Dr. Harok Bae was a great professor. He seemed to put a lot of time and effort into instructing the FEA course. He even made jokes from time to time trying to get a few laughs and that helped keep everyone's attention. I would recommend taking courses with Dr. Bae. :: lab 2 was particularly long and frustrating, I would have appreciated a warning ahead of time so I could show up early and finish the lab in one go instead of having to come back another day to finish the lab. :: To be honest he is ineffective and provides an atmosphere of not wanting to teach. :: No. :: no. :: No."
2614,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The TA was pretty knowledgeable and seemed to be able to help out when it was needed. :: Fairly effective. :: The Lab Assistant for this lab did fine. He did not let the class know what was specifically required for the reports and thus the class grade was lower than the others. :: Dr. Bae was not very involved in the lab and the TA was alright. He didn't really seem to know the software well, but he tried. :: The lab TA was very helpful. He could fix any issues I came across. He also explained all the parts of the lab well. :: Dr. Bae, Didn't have any effected on the Lab.  Meghal Patel was the TA for the lab and he did good job of explaining the lab content.  The lab tutorials for the most part was very well organized and probably is my favorite lab I have had at Wright State. I really enjoyed learning ANSYS and looked forward in learning more."
2615,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: The lab assistant graded the labs on material that was not specified in the Syllabus (Having pictures in specific sections, making the analysis greater than half a page), this was confusing to figure out what went wrong on the first lab. :: The initial grading criteria is not accurate and we didn't learn until the second lab what was actually expected by us, which lead to a poor grade on the first report and nearly 100% on the subsequent reports. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2616,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- This was a lab, so it didn't always take up the whole period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The TA was always on time and in the lab for the duration. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2617,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The TA walked around the room and made sure to help anybody that needed it. He was also very responsive to emails. :: This doesn't seem like an applicable question. :: The LA answered my questions. :: He explained all of the details for the lab thoroughly and made it so all the students could understand. :: Was always available to answers questions about the lab.
2618,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Fairly effectively. :: The lab had little to due with lecture since the class used MATLAB and lab used ANSYS. Going back and forth between programs was confusing, especially since the class had no experience of ANSYS prior to this. :: The TA tried his best, but there was a language barrier. :: Communication was good. :: Good"
2619,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The labs were alright. No where near as put-together as the lecture. :: The labs were extremely well organized. :: Yes, the lab tutorials help teach course content."

2621,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Overall this was a nice addition to the FEA course. In the future though, I think the project should be adjusted because after the course, many students still do not know how to use ANSYS completely by themselves. :: The outdated ANSYS version used in this lab is clunky and in dire need of replacement. I'd recommend WSU update the software such that the material learned in lab is more applicable to the workplace. :: The labs were great. I felt like I gained a basic understanding of the lab, enough for me to do general modeling in ANSYS. Also, the labs were explained very well and had an easy to follow structure that explained why you did every step."
2622,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: Lab overall understanding was lacking. The program used is out of date and ineffective. I learned more in a week doing the final project than what the labs taught. :: Good. :: I extremely disliked the TA for this lab. Bae has nothing to do with this course. The TA was rude, unapproachable, and inconsistent in grading policies. :: TA was Kind of hard to understand but was somewhat helpful at certain times. :: Good. :: He was not our lab TA and did not really have anything to do with the lab. :: The Lab TA was very helpful. :: Fine. :: The material was fully represented"

2625,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: -. :: Nope. The TA didn't care whether we learned ANSYS or not. :: Yes. :: it was a fun lab. :: The Lab TA always went over the full lab before the class started and was willing to help out with any issues during the lab. :: pertinent examples
2626,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: yes. :: The TA rarely used email, and when he would reply he would say things like ""ask your friends for assistance"". He did not want to do his job. :: He did an ok job. :: very effectively. :: Very effectively. :: very effective"
2627,Harok Bae,2018 Fall,ME 4120L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: yes. :: The labs were detailed in pretyped booklets. The TA decided halfway through the labs that he would no longer provide our lab manuals and did not feel like notifying the students. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the lab instructions were mostly easy to follow. :: yes"

2630,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Somewhat effective. :: overall ok class. :: This Instructor is in no way effective.  The class is miserably unorganized with no excuse for the class is not new.  We had maybe 5 lectures during the semester when things were ""taught"" that were all general knowledge. :: Good professor. :: This was the most disorganized class ever. As a ""team leader"" he should have known when due dates were and what needed to be done prior to them. Especially for teaching the class for several years . :: Sort of effective. :: . :: Was a good professor. :: Dr. Roberts does excellent job in teaching this course. He also listens to students during project evaluation and is helpful in trying to help students with projects. :: He was effective at conveying his information. He was slightly disorganized, but he communicated effectively. His presentations were long and had very little in the means of interesting graphics. It was mainly just text. :: Very Effective. :: Rory is great. Kind professor and has good information to share. Rambles sometimes but always has good information to share. Alan Jackson is kind, but he is no longer able to teach because he can't walk through a coherent thought without a random tangent."
2631,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: stuck with syllabus. :: No.  When assignments were graded, WHICH NEVER HAPPENED ON TIME, things were commented on that were never asked for within the rubrics.  When rubrics were given, they did not agree with the provided templates for that same given assignment. :: Yes. :: No, the rubrics were not concise with each other. The examples would show one thing and a template would be different. :: Yes. :: Not really large portion of the grade is based off of an advisor that has no real knowledge about how the project is progressing. :: . :: From what was graded yes but the grades took a while to get in and even still have not been entered from the beginning of the semester. :: Yes. :: I believe so, the problem was the rubric or guidelines were unclear. :: Yes. :: Yeah they covered it all"
2632,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: normally used the time he had. :: Class regularly started anywhere between 3-5 minutes late.  Generally the class was released early as well. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Typically. :: . :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he started on time and used the entire class period. :: yes. :: Yes
2633,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He held regularly scheduled team meetings so he could stay updated on our design project. :: brought in guest speakers. :: Provided useful information. :: The class was a waste of time and money. I knew all this stuff back from technical communications so I don't know why we had to go over it again. I rather worked on the project then attended the class. :: No. :: Meetings with him to update. :: . :: yes he seemed interested in out learning and our project topics. :: Yes, He was always available to answers questions or help guide students in the right directions with their projects. :: He had personal meeting with each group. :: The bi-weekly meetings showed that he was interested in each teams project. :: We had biweekly meetings because he was interested in making sure our groups were progressing."
2634,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Not extremely well. He rarely answered any emails, and it took him almost the whole semester to grade some of our assignments. So, we never knew how we were actually doing in the class until right at the end. :: communicated well in class, never got an email back from him. :: INSTRUCTOR WAS NOT EFFECTIVE WHAT-SO-EVER.  He never mentioned when assignments were due in class or over email.  Students regularly had to refer to the class schedule which was changed multiple times throughout the semester.  Students were in a state of constant confusion.  Roberts pretty much had to be asked to grade anything.  We just did final presentations and we still have not received a grade for our initial presentations. :: In the classroom and in meetings, he communicated well to students. :: He responded to emails very well but assignments took forever to be graded. :: Very unorganized class. :: Communicated fine. :: . :: Communicated well on changes to the syllabus. :: He did good job in communicate through emails and during class lecture. :: He communicated well with the class, but his rubrics and expectations were not clear. :: Slow about responding to emails outside of class. :: Email and his voice."
2635,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: they were organized. :: NO. NO. and NO. :: Yes. :: No, they were not. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The slides contained very few pictures and graphics, which made the information and lecture hard to pay attention to. :: Yes. :: Rory was organized and coherent."

I would say he is not good at responding to emails. :: Yes, he was responsive. :: No, grades took forever to get back. :: Sometimes. :: . :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Rory did a great job as the professor."
2637,Rory Roberts,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: This class was very disorganized, especially when you take into consideration that it has been taught many, many times before. Also, in the coming years, please allow students to choose their teams/projects again. It makes absolutely no sense to randomly assign these projects; I know I for one am stuck with a project that I have absolutely no interest in, and my groupmates refuse to contribute to the project. When the project is randomly assigned, you're not going to see students working on something that they're passionate about with a thriving team; you're just going to get a crappy senior design project that the students threw together because they had to. :: This class needs WORK. Like wow.  Not a good example of the Department of Engineering.  This class had no organization or structure. :: Responding to emails would help. Also, I think the presentation and proposal should be worth more towards our grade. I think having our advisor control 50% of our grade is unnecessary considering our advisor wasn't that much of help. :: . :: Not at this time. :: The class is a hodgepodge of random information being thrown at seniors to help prepare them for a real job, but it is somewhat ridiculous how things are so incoherent at times. Some groups have design projects that they themselves organized. Some groups have research projects that have nothing to do with design whatsoever. And everyone is graded the same based off of there ability to accomplish menial tasks for the sake of the class rather than actually accomplishing a useful project. I don't think I will walk away learning how to accomplish a two semester long goal after this, I will walk away having learned how to do what I need to do on a project to get the grade Wright State decides to give me based off of attendance, journal entries, and cookie cutter project presentations.  Try to make this class into something that students can take pride in, maybe starting it off a couple semesters prior by telling students to start finding teams and meeting with different faculty to discuss potential project ideas. And grade the class based off of there advisor/client satisfaction, like they would be in the real world on an engineering project. Make this a class everyone is looking forward to taking because it can be a chance to use everything they have learned, not just a project that has to be completed for a diploma."

Describes concepts well, answers questions, and engages the class in example problems. :: Dr.  Li was a great lecturer and was available during office hours.  He also answered emails. :: Dr. Li's lectures were informative but the teaching style was not engaging. He basically wrote directly from the textbook. :: good instructor. :: A very effective teacher, gave students practice problems that allowed students to practice for each exam. :: Great. :: Great at going over examples and explaining concepts, would skip over a few ""easy"" parts that I got hung up on but was open to questions always. :: Fantastic teacher and cares about student's learning. :: He did a very nice job!. :: He was an effective instructor in the way that he had a well laid out plan, he is a very rubric oriented professor who is great at staying inside his plan for each lecture. He writes his notes from very neatly pre-written notes ahead of time and goes over a few examples out of the notes he wrote that he deems adequate for each topic. :: Very good professor. :: Li was effective in his teaching style. Everything was clear and concise and we knew what was expected of us. :: Sheng Li is a great professor.

While short at times, he really knows his subject matter and teaches it well. :: Very effective. :: great. :: a. :: The professor gave good background to each lab and then allowed individuals to perform the lab when they desired too.

However, I would note that some of the instructions for the actual performance of the labs given by the TAs differed from the lab instructions. In future, it would be helpful if the TAs completely know how to set up each lab and answer questions clearly."

Improvement of guidance from the TAs could help. It seemed at some points they were unsure on how to run the labs. Once that they can completely answer students' questions thoroughly, I think the lab will have a good set up. I also would prefer if there was a peer review for the group members at the end of the term though. Some members would procrastinate to the last day and would put in minimal effort for parts of the papers. I think this would be beneficial for fairness of the work that each student puts into the each lab."

2677,Maher Amer,2018 Fall,ME 4170,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Very informative class, one of my favorites in my time as a college student. :: It would be a shame to remove this class if there are any plans to. It was a great learning experience and was by far my favorite class this semester. Dr. Amer is a great professor and I enjoyed learning from him a lot. :: Favorite class I took this semester. Also one of my favorite professors. :: I, hope they can joint a lab with this class to develop the student skills"
2678,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was very flexible, and knowledgeable. I feel as if I leaned a large amount of knowledge from him. :: I assume this is for both the prof and the LA. They were both good from what I could tell. I do not have any lab experience other than this and so therefore I cannot tell how effective their instruction was, but I felt like I learned a lot. :: Worked well. Without TA dunno how class would have went. :: Prof. Young is effective in that he teaches real-world applications of the subject matter."
2679,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yup. :: yes. :: Yes
2680,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Not always on time, it was negligible, however. The class time was always available, but not used for teaching all of time. This is as I fell it should be though being 1 credit hr and all. :: independent lab, so instructor was not needed for the full time. :: Yes"
2681,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He was willing to help/ show you a process repeatedly so you could do the process correctly. :: Asked where we were in the labs and made sure we were able to get what we were attempting figured out. :: yes. :: You can tell he enjoys answering questions and enjoys problem solving--as any engineer/scientist would.
2682,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: Decently effectively. :: well. :: Very well
2683,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- pretty well. :: Not well organized, but that didn't really effect their usefulness to my knowledge. :: no real lectures. :: Yes"
2684,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes, helpful by email. :: yes, or the TA was. :: Yes"
2685,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 2600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Nope. I think it was a good class. Interesting. Helpful prof/LA. :: I like this Professor, he is one of my more liked professors in material science."
2686,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Great! Always engaging and relaxed. Enjoyed going to his lectures. :: The instructor was effective at teaching the course content. :: Good professor, he aims more for an understanding of the subject rather than a wide range of knowledge. :: I enjoyed this class. I wouldn't recommend changing anything. :: Dr. Young was an effective teacher who taught from the book and was insightful on information or clarification of material. :: very effective.  made sure students understood materials before moving on in class.  Even set aside a couple class periods as review for relevant info from a previous class that was needed in order to understand the next topics. :: Very effective. Explained concepts using in-depth derivations and applied real-world concepts to the math. :: I struggled following most of the time during class and feel like a lot of it was just scattered information. What I did understand he did effectively explain but most I just didn't understand. I do like how he made homework worth a lot which made students want to do it and not just skip it because it wasn't worth it. :: Very effective. :: One of my favorite instructors I have had at Wright State. Always on time. :: Not the worst professor, just needs to spend more time looking over the material before class. Always seemed very unprepared and unable to answer difficult questions from students. Spent too much time deriving equations, examples would have kept more people interested and aware of what is going on. :: Dan was a great professor.  He knows his stuff. :: Great professor. :: Dr. Young knows his material. It often seemed like he was a little disorganized at times. He often would change a mistake halfway through the problem and leave us hanging as to how to fix it in our personal notes. He was very approachable, and I enjoyed the interactions I had with him after and during class. :: Got the job done. :: very effective, great professor. :: Effective. :: He was a pretty good professor, some of his notes were a little disorganized, but he made sure we knew the material, and he would often pause and do more examples if we didn't completely understand a certain topic. :: Very Effective. :: I enjoyed the lectures and feel as if they taught the material very well. I feel as if they were lacking in organization or structure a bit. I do feel as the lectures could get a bit repetitive/drawn out at times. :: Very good professor, very knowledgeable. A bit too much time proving methods, which is okay, but that extra time proving a method could be spent doing one or two more example exercises. Trust me when I say I believe the method to be true and don't need it to be proven time and time again. :: He is very unorganized in lecture. He talks himself in circles and tells a lot of information that is not needed to understand and leaves us more confused because there was to much excess information that did not pertain to the problem"
2687,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Absolutely. He modified his syllabus a little bit (we didn't have any quizzes) to add a course project. Grading was fair and in line with the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, there were a few times where I missed points on a homework assignment without being sure why, but overall He graded fairly. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes.  I wish he posted homework grades on pilot though. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, it would have been nice to have received the homework sooner and/or had homework grades displayed on pilot. :: Yes, very fair grader as well. :: Yes"
2688,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: He showed up late a few times, but never more than a couple minutes. :: Yes, he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, sometimes went over the class time. :: Yes. :: Class usually got out 5 minutes early because we could not finish problem in time. :: Yes, like clockwork. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, we started on time and used time effectively. :: Always on time. :: Yes"
2689,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Always answered questions even if they're some stupid ones being asked repeatedly by certain students in the class. :: The instructor demonstrated interest by going into detail with the content he was teaching. :: Communicated well with us and tried to communicate with us what would be expected in the future. :: Displayed nothing in particular. Just asked if we had questions and allowed us to clarify information or any confusion. :: made sure to answer as many questions in class as he could.  spent time after class with students who still had questions at the end.   was available outside of class for office hours. :: The homework followed the examples in class well and the exams were relatively straightforward with very few surprises. He lectured clearly and concisely, and was willing to schedule exams based on students' schedules and other exams. :: Always ready to answer questions and was excited about the topics. :: Taught by writing notes on the board and going over a lot of examples. :: Able to help outside of class if needed. :: This is college.  Professors don't have to demonstrate that.  But dan was definitely engaging and willing to answer all questions. :: Answered any and all questions. :: Provided extra readings when necessary. :: he always asked us if we had questions and was responsive to us. very nice. :: Answered any questions, provided any extra info we might need on Pilot. :: He always checked to make sure we understood a concept. And if we didn't, he would do additional examples to make sure we comprehended it. :: Yes. :: Yes he was committed to making sure everything was learned and understood and was open to questions. :: Yes, the professor is very enthusiastic about the class and gives real world advice to future engineers. :: Yes he did. He is a great person just needs to focus on getting the point across better. He was hard to follow but really did care about the students success"
2690,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Perhaps he could email a bit more and update Pilot with homework due dates?. :: The communicated very effectively. :: Responsive to questions and emails, when sent. :: He communicated well both inside and outside of the classroom. :: very effectively answered questions and emails. :: Very well. :: Very effectively. :: good. :: Sent emails when necessary. :: good. :: communication was perfect. :: He often went off on tangents which really lost the classes attention. Besides that, well. :: very effectively always knew when things where due. :: Well, answered questions and emailed if need be. :: he did fine. :: Very Effectively. :: Fairly well. At times when assignments were delayed due to challenges with a homework problem, it would have been nice for us to be informed that the due date had been extended before the class time. :: He communicates often via email. Responds reasonably fast. :: He was always available to speak to"
2691,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Not quite.  Through multiple pauses and lack of connections between topics, it was difficult to follow along and find the flow as topics were strung together.  Also, the use of some ambiguous pictures without following up with equations became difficult to learn from. :: Yes, he tried to stick to the syllabus and when we got a bit off he was able to pull us back to it. :: Yes, he went sequential with the book. :: yes. :: Yes, definitely. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No, nobody ever knew what was going on because almost all the classes were spend deriving equations when it could have been explained with an example and understood better than the derivation. :: Yes, sometimes Dr. young spent a little too much time trying to figure out how to explain something.  This should have been figured out prior to class. :: Dr. Young sometimes became lost in his notes. He often made mistakes on the board and took a lot of time to find them. He often drew the same picture 4 to 5 times until he could get his point across. :: Organized in his notes but often messed them up when transitioning to the board. Which confused everyone. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes, the notes tended to get a little messy at times, but he made sure to always come back around to the main topic. :: Yes. :: As stated above there could be a bit more structure to the lecture. :: Yes, everything is detailed in the syllabus. :: It wasn't he was very hard to follow. Many times I learned more by reading the book than I did in lecture"
2692,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes.  On multiple occasions the instructor was available and very responsive to needs and questions. :: Yes, when I needed something out of class he answered well. :: Did not go to office hours, can not comment. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Never contacted him so I can not attest to this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always available and if not he would notify us. :: Yes"
2693,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great lecturer! Would take again. :: Refer to the course organization question for comments on the lecture style. :: Said anything that was on either end of the spectrum would be ejected so I just gave an honest opinion of the class and its instructor. :: Great class. Felt relevant to the field and I definitely felt like the work I put into the class equaled what I got out of it. The end-of-the-semester project was also a huge plus for a practical look at the concepts taught in class. Very well done, great teacher, would take another class of his again. :: Maybe labeling exactly what section is being worked on so students could follow along with the book. :: No. :: Great instructor class time was used wisely.  Cons no reviews before exams Just now getting the class project the week before finals. Would've been nice to have more time. :: Not a bad professor, just needs to prepare and understand the subject more. I would suggest spending less time deriving. Also took forever to fix a grading error on my exam (still hasn't been fixed). :: Dr. young is fantastic.  I liked his teaching style.  One thing that kinda frustrated me was that it seemed like he threw a bunch of equations up on the board and never said which ones were important.  Also a lot of examples in this class can be given by bringing a yard stick to demonstrate bending or a simple rod to demonstrate torsion.  Videos of things being bent or things in torsion would help a lot in the understanding of the material.  The thermal stuff is challenging so some more real world examples would be nice.   Dr, young should consider adding more examples to his class. :: I believe the class would have been more beneficial if we had done less derivations and more time on practical applications. While the derivations give me a general idea of where the equations come from, I already just accept the equations and have trouble paying attention during basic calculus. :: Young always said he couldn't fit all the material in with the amount of classes we had, yet he used half of each class to go off on a different subject? Waste of my time. :: Hes a great professor!. :: No. :: Very good professor, anyone that takes a class with him will find him to be wonderful."
2694,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Confusing but took time during class to answer questions, which was very helpful. Hard to follow along with what chapters were being covered and what we would be tested on. Online  visual aids served more effective than hand drawn. :: Good instructor. :: Best instructor at Wright State. :: Very effective and thorough. :: Very effective. :: was good at teaching the hard topics in this class.  Clear explanation and would spend extra time on harder topics. :: Not the most effective, but not the least. He seems to know what he is talking about, but lectures are hard to follow and often drag on over less important subjects. Needs to come to class more prepared to lecture. :: Very effective. Enthusiastic lecturer, skilled at communicating concepts to students and connecting concepts to one another."
2695,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes, the syllabus described exactly what was expected. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2696,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: always on time. and always used the full class period. :: Sometimes running late because of a tight schedule. :: Yes"
2697,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Took frequent polls of the class on what we wanted to learn and what we had already learned, which was greatly appreciated. :: Asked if students had questions after each topic. :: He is very invested in the learning of his students.  He makes an effort to teach the class how the students want it to be taught, and cover subjects we would like to learn about. :: Asked for questions. Adjusted the course schedule based on what we wanted to learn. :: yes, professor would stay after and answer any questions. Along with providing us with further materials to better our understanding outside of class. :: Personally polled the class when he wanted feedback on different situations. :: Made sure the class consistently understood what was going on in lecture, asked class about their background to cover what was necessary, and asked class what they are most interested in learning/what is new to them for the material for the final few weeks of the course."
2698,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Would have helped to get graded homework back sooner. :: Good. :: Very well. :: Effectively. He made everyone aware of expectations and was willing to help as much as possible. :: Very effective. :: Professor had no issue communicating. :: Well. :: Very effectively both in and out of the classroom
2699,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Very unorganized. Sometimes felt that he was unprepared until the next lecture. So a lot of the course felt like him teaching himself and us trying to catch up. :: Lectures were disorganized.  Frequently had to redo an example one or two times to correct mistakes and discrepancies in professor's notes. :: Yes. :: Absolutely. :: Not really. The lectures seemed improvised on the spot. The lack of structure made it somewhat hard to go back and review for exams. :: lectures sometimes became a little unorganized but for the most part followed the syllabus and covered all course requirements. :: Could use improvement. A lot of class time was used going back over stuff that was taught wrong the first time. :: Yes, very logically structured."
2700,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: instructor was always in his office hours and responded to emails quickly. :: Yes. :: Yes, I stopped by office hours a few times and questions were always answered clearly"
2701,Henry Young,2018 Fall,ME 4770,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Would be a great class with better preparation and organization. There was no homework--therefore, no practice--for the content after the second exam. Also, lectures, book, and homework were not enough preparation for the exam. Book was not great--many mistakes. Also, often times there was only one example in the book and that was the example used in class. Would be nice to have additional examples beyond what the book provides. :: No. :: He's one of the most fair, thorough and genuinely enthusiastic professors I've ever had. :: good professor that knows the topics he is teaching. :: The class set up goes over mostly derivations. I personally do not get much out of this type of class set up.  Working problems similar to exams is helpful compared to just writing equations on the board and erasing them 5 minutes later. If derivations are needed to teach the class they should be sprinkled in as a dessert and not the main course. :: Really enjoyed the class- I had picked up bits and pieces of the information before but having them synthesized in one place has improved my understanding of what is going on with regard to the mechanical behavior of metals"
2702,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- overall effectiveness 9.5/10. :: He has been pretty much effective during the whole course. :: Dr. Farajian is good instructor. In his lecture we get both practical and theoretical knowledge. :: He is on time, organized, very responsive and willing to help during his office hours,overall effective instructor."
2703,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes he evaluates on time and he was up to mark with the course syllabus. :: Absolutely. :: Yes. :: yes
2704,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes he started the class on time and yes he utilized all the time effectively. :: yes always on time. :: Yes. :: yes
2705,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes, he gave us so many journals to read which helped our interest in learning. :: He has always been friendly and have shown various news videos about hydrogen and its value to the future and has described the importance of the subject which has motivated all of us. :: He is very much interested in learning new things in every lecture."
2706,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- he was helpful both inside and outside the class. :: He has always been very helpful both in and out of the class. :: He communicates well.
2707,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes learned a good amount of knowledge from the course and lectures was well organized. :: yes it was well organized. :: Yup. :: yes
2708,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- he was available and responded to your all the emails sent. :: yes always. :: My doubts is clear in class so I don't have any experience regarding office hours. :: yes"
2709,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7520,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- he was another best professor whom I had a chance to interact with. :: Its been my second course under him and its been equally fruitful and interesting. He has always been friendly and always been helpful. :: We learned new software throughout semester which is very good for our future. :: He is knowledgeable in his filed."
2710,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He is a wonderful instructor
2711,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes
2712,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Absolutely, yes. :: Yes"
2713,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Did a great job.
2714,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Well

2717,Amir Farajian,2018 Fall,ME 7730,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is a great instructor."
2718,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- James was a solid professor. I believe he htook pride in his lecture and tried to explain everything the best he could. :: Great guy. Probably the best lecturer I've had a Wright State. :: Relatively effective. In-class notes are very hard to follow. :: Fairly effective. :: Not only does he record his lectures, but he posts his formatted computer notes, live lecture notes, and screen recording from each lecture to PILOT. This way, I can break both my legs and still stay up to date on what is covered in class. My only criticism in relation to lecture notes are that the drawings he makes in one note tend to be hard to read/understand. When he used the white board, it was excellent. I think this is caused by the inherent side affect of writing on a touch screen (even I have a bad signature in some situations). But by recording his lectures and screen, students can re-watch lectures to figure out what he did. Thank you for putting this much effort into being effective Dr. Menart. :: he is the best professor i have ever met. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Menart did a fabulous job instructing ME 3320. This was my first semester with him, but I would highly recommend him to anyone who wishes to gain a deep understanding of the material he presents. Granted, a lot of the learning had to be done on our own time because he would fly through the lectures often not giving enough time for the students to follow the example problems, but his poise and attitude about the class was one to be applauded. I commend you Dr. Menart for your wonderful service to us students. :: Dr. Menart was extremely thorough on the teachings of this class and related almost all material to real world examples. He was able to answer nearly every question that the students had and explain the material in a way we could understand. The exams were more than fair and he provided the tools we needed to pass the class without issue. :: Dr. Menart is a great professor and was really effective in his instruction. :: James is very clear with his grading and homework. Schedule easy to understand. Very good lectures. :: Arguably the best overall professor I have had at Wright State. Menart should teach courses for other faculty on how to teach class. If he and Mitch Wolff taught every class, Wright State Engineering would compete with Stanford. :: very the course was layed out and well presented"
2719,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Based fully off of preset expectations. :: Yes. :: Yes, He is one of the few professors that (I assume) graded all assignments. This caused more useful comments to be made instead of vague marks made by TA's. At no point did I feel he was going rogue and making up the grading rubric as he graded HW. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, there were no surprises when it came to grading or expectations. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
2720,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, very punctual. :: Yes. :: Always started on time usually used more than full time. :: Yes..at least when OneNote was cooperating. :: Yes, He would also extend the class period sometimes. Since the students let him go over a couple times in class, it would be great if that extra time is transferred to exams. This may or may not be sarcasm laced with humor. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Always started on time and often we even ran over due to the length of the material. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
2721,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Was very helpful when questions were proposed. Did a great job answering questions thoroughly. :: Always answered questions and made sure we covered the topics in depth. Always responded quickly to emails and even recorded his lectures to post on Pilot. :: Tried keeping individuals engaged by asking questions and doing group questions during class. :: Very much. He has a passion for Thermodynamics and it shows. :: The level of interest expressed in my learned was more than most professors. Dr. Menart brought in a Heat Pump system to power a fan to physically show students concepts in class. This was the hallmark because at this point in my academic career, I can't tell if the theoretical systems discussed directly relate to practical devices. By having the physical device in the room, I can look at the mechanical system and see how it mechanical operates to transfer energy. I can't easily visualize the mechanical operation when I am only given a two dimensional sketch with just boxes marked combustor, condensor, turbine, etc.. :: Menart demonstrated a great interest in our learning on multiple occasions. :: Dr. Menart engaged with the class throughout the lecture and would offer help one of one whenever needed. :: Dr. Menart was actively engaging the class while also applying thermo in a practical sense. :: James would constantly bring real world examples into class, many times literally, which would facilitate learning and understanding. Group work was encouraged. :: yes very open with after class to discuss"
2722,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Yes. :: Great! Quick email replies. :: Relatively well. :: He was always available to help students after class or in his office. :: Dr. Menart communicated very well. He answered emails in a timely manner (I never had to remind him about a email I sent). I like the no-nonsense approach to communication because the most valuable resource we have is time, and it should not be wasted with nonsense (humor is different than nonsense). :: Very effective. :: Very prompt communication and provided lecture videos and notes for all the subjects covered. :: He was effective during class by teaching parallel to the book. This provides continuity between in and out of class work. :: Emails, Pilot, and courses were very well orchastrated. :: very well"
2723,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, it was all organized well, but Assignments were given prior to the topics being finished, which means it was nearly impossible to work ahead on things and the homework had to continuously be done at the last minute which was frustrating. :: Yes. I wish we would have gotten a bit more into the combustion stuff. Is there a possibility of offering a combustion class to undergrads?. :: Very well organized material. :: This is his down fall. He's very scatterbrained and it reflected in his notes. I had a hard time following him during lectures. :: Dr. Menart organized the course content and lectures very well. The order he covered the book made sense. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Extremely well organized, course flow made more sense than the chapter orders of the book. :: Dr. Menart was well organized. The only thing I would suggest is the clarity of his writing, but that is not necessarily a critical improvement. :: Yes. :: Most organized professor I have had besides Scott Thomas. :: yes"
2724,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes,. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Menart was willing to communicate online and outside class during scheduled hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Menart always had spare time to help if needed. :: yes very. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes!"
2725,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 3320,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Overall effective instructor who you could tell cared and put effort into his lecture.  Did not Like the fact homework was assigned prior to the lectures covering it, which prevented students from working ahead.  Did not understand why we could not use examples to help with homework, since examples are the basis of all my studying and understanding, which made it harder to learn in this class.  Felt restricted in my ability to learn as a result of that. :: Favorite professor! I do wish he pushed his students a bit harder though. His exams were pretty easy. I think a lot of people like him simply because he's known to go easy on grading. :: None. :: Dr. Menart did a very good job with this material, the next best thing I can think of is to have students physically build a device using principles from the class. If it were possible to make a bunch of components that can be combined into different processes, I would pay double to experience it. Thank you Dr. Menart for putting effort into making an excellent class. I am also thankful for being tolerant   of the rambunctious bunch in the back corner of the room. While this group should have showed you more respect during your lectures, I appreciate that you did not let them impact your lectures. I wish Wright State would keep these reviews open until after finals week, because in the past I have had professors steer students the wrong direction while they studied for the final. :: Dr. Menart is exactly what I look for in a professor providing more than enough material and alternate learning options for the material. Has a vast amount of knowledge about the subject and easy to work with if extra help is needed. :: Nope. :: Give Menart a position deciding how more programs should be run, he is phenomenal. Menart if you're the only one reading this, send it to Slater and tell him anonymous student 001 says to give you more control. :: keep it up your teaching style is phenomenon"
2726,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- 10/10. :: Dr. Menart is probably my favorite professor at Wright State. I havent come across a professor who loved their subject more than him. This rubs off on students, because from the outside looking in, his topics and subjects seem a little bland, but taking him for Thermodynamics, Wind Power, and now Energy Conversion has summoned this desire to potentially pursue a future in the field. He is extremely kind and funny, and doesnt throw any curveballs at you. Gives you notes on what he sees as important, and expects nothing more or less than that. I have learned more from Dr. Menart than ANY professor i have ever had. :: . :: not very effective. The notes are unclear and unorganized. He makes so many mistakes in his notes. :: All over the place with his lectures. Not at all organized. :: Great. :: Very well. :: One of best professors to teach renewable energy classes in WSU"
2727,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Absolutely. A fantastic grader of work, and cares way more about the process and knowledge than the final answer (but he does love when you get that right answer). I have felt very comfortable with all of the tests he has graded and given back to me. :: . :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Probably expanded the course to cover more content. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2728,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Always. He would actually get their early and have all of his stuff set up so he would start on time, and always apologized for going over the time limit (despite it always just being a couple minutes and never a big deal). :: . :: No and it is very frustrating. He often writes things on the board ahead of class so you better be early or you'll start off behind. He goes over time every single lecture which is extremely frustrating when you have work after. :: yes for the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Always"
2729,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he taught. :: Dr. Menart's best quality is this question right here. He LOVES his subjects and topics. The amount of research and study that he performs on these subjects is astounding. His topics are difficult, and he absolutely does his best to make it as simple as possible for his students. Sometimes, the topics and material are still hard, and he makes sure to help and walk through it so we all understand. Not all knowledge is easy to obtain. :: . :: he taught us how to get rich!. :: hes very knowledgeable about energy and its clear he cares about the topic. :: Yes. :: Examples. :: Very much"
2730,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- effectively. :: Very well. Answered questions as best as he could in class, and sent emails whenever he had to. :: . :: good. :: He communicates okay. :: Very responsive to emails and office hours. :: Very effective"
2731,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Absolutely yes. He recorded lectures and followed his syllabus near perfectly. His lectures and notes are easy to find and very organized. :: . :: nothing in this class is organized at all. He draws on the board and highlights things to the point that they are unreadable. His handwriting is awful which doesn't help. Honestly, this class was a mess. He spends so much time on theory that we hardly do any examples. :: No, worst organized lectures I've seen. :: Yes. :: Mostly. For it being a course for distance and on main campus it went well. Lectures did seem unorganized at times, especially with scrolling up to add something to the previous notes mentioned earlier. :: Yes"
2732,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. Never had to email him or communicate much, but i have great belief he would reply when necessary. :: . :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2733,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 4530,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I just want to say thank you Dr. Menart for being a great professor to me in my final semester. I took Wind Power and Energy Conversion for 2 of my technical electives and i am so happy i did because i have discovered a new field (in energy) that I am so interested in. I am probably just another student to you (i know youve been doing this a long time) but you have done such a fantastic job as a professor here at Wright State. Your love for your subjects and material is unmatched.  I wish you the best, Taylor McDowell. :: . :: The class wasn't terrible but organization and Dr. Menart starting and ending class on time would make it much better. :: He makes so many mistakes in his class its hard to follow sometimes. He has incredible instructor notes and I wish he taught from them instead of his memory. If he was more organized with his teaching, he's be a very solid professor. Overall, hes a nice guy and this is a very interesting class. His exams are a little rough, especially the definition section. :: Best professor this semester. :: Does well, needs to work on time management as we constantly go over the allotted amount of time. Need to work on making lectures a little more structured. Overall great professors. :: Everyone should take this class. Energy conversion was taught in the most comprehensive and effective manner. Menartâs exams are hard but itâs worth taking the class."
2734,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Excellent. :: very effective
2735,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes
2736,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: yes
2737,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Cares a lot. :: by giving small tasks in completing the work
2738,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Highly effective. :: very effective
2739,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes
2740,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Always. :: yes"
2741,James Menart,2018 Fall,ME 7950,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no"
2742,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not very. His class is agonizing. Speedy-PowerPoint lectures and vague descriptions of content from a lousy textbook? Wow, how effective. :: Unfortunately, this was the worst class I have had so far.  Before going into class, I wasn't too excited about the material, but this class was terrible and an utter waste of time.  There was no organization of this class.  I cannot express this enough. This is not a topic that can just be talked about.  Also, given us ""real life"" advice gets old after the first time. I already work at a real job and maybe half of what was said is true anyway. Maybe focus on the material and not on what you might feel is real life.  Another note. PowerPoint can be a great tool for class. It isn't always the best, but it isn't a bad tool.  In this class, the PowerPoint slides are garbage. I downloaded them and everyone just had text boxes scattered everywhere.  Just terrible.  Idk how much effort was put into these, but not much extra work was needed to even make them presentable.  Probably the largest disappointment I had with this class was the terrible attitude of the professor. There were several occasions where I was thoroughly participating in class and asked a question. These occasions led to the professor doing three things. 1. Neglecting to try and answer the question. 2. Had an awful attitude even saying anything to me at all. 3. The professor actually just walked away while he told me he couldn't answer the question.  I want to share the worst instance of this.  This was the point where I started to come to class, sign in, and leave early so I could go to work to learn HVAC design.   We were talking about the difference between an analog signal and a discrete/digital signal.  My previous experience with analog signals and digital signals is with sequences of air handling units.  So I knew the difference between the two.  The activity was to determine if an instrument was an analog or digital signal. The object was a cruise control in a car. I asked Jackson, ""Is it just turning the cruise control on and off or setting a speed for the car?"" Now I got a reply saying ""What do you think?"" That doesn't answer my question at all. After saying this, the professor starting walking away and I said that it matters which situation because it affects the answer. But Jackson did not have the consideration to stop and talk about it. Instead, he started to walk away and just said it is whatever I think it should be.  This is not remotely a way to teach.  It isn't even a way to be considerate to a student. We had to turn this assignment in and we had to write long paragraphs explaining what we knew and how confusing the situation was.  I did not enjoy this class one bit. From what I understand, Jackson has had brain surgery and might have a harder time teaching because of it.  Ok. Yeah, it would be tougher, but this isn't high school and if this subject is that important, then, unfortunately, he shouldn't be teaching it.  I also believe that just because someone worked on base, it doesn't mean that you can just teach at a college. But apparently, wright state thinks it is ok. I wish I didn't have to write a review like this, but everything was very disappointing. :: The overall effectiveness of Dr. Jackson was little to none. He is not a good educator and the class was not spent well. :: The overall effectiveness of Allen Jackson teaching ME 3600 was not that well.  I feel as if the information that was attempting to be taught in the class could be potentially useful but not the way it was taught this semester. The class was mainly taught with powerpoint slides with long confusing equations we never actually use in the homework or in exams. The structure of the class felt poorly organized and we seemed to waste  a lot of the class time reading off the solution manual to us. :: Not effective at all and is the worst professor I ever had. I would learn more taking a nap than I would in this class. :: Did not like learning from slides. I can read a power point at home. :: I didn't learn anything. :: I am certain that if the material was easier and the source material the class draws from was of higher quality, I would have learned something in this class.  Since the material is difficult and the source material is garbage however, I feel like Prof. Jackson has his work cut out for him.  I learned some things due to the reports we wrote and the powerpoints Jackson prepared. :: Terrible. :: Dr. Jackson's class does very little to further my education. While he is capable of explaining the material to small groups of students, he does not effective in the classroom. Unfortunately, this class caused more confusion than it did understanding. :: ineffective. :: Extremely ineffective, taught directly out of his lecture notes and only used the solution manual to work problems. Often had mistakes in what he was teaching or couldn't explain the subject matter we were on. Hard to understand and even harder to work with. All responses were extremely convoluted and the course basically had to be taught to ourselves. :: Dr. Jackson was reasonably effective. The information taught in this class not clear cut. :: Class was overall very ineffective in conveying ideas - lectures were vague, lacked focus and clarity - powerpoints were too large and splitting them into different files basic on different topics of the same chapter made organization messy. :: Ineffective instructor. The material was easy, but he made it seem impossible and confusing. :: Good. :: Not very effective at all. Lectures were very disorganized, he would go way off topic and not really give adequate information for classes. For example, when going through a presentation a slide with barely any information would be discussed for long periods of time, but a slide full of over 10 equations would be discussed for seconds. It seemed very disorganized and his solution manual wasn't even correct that you utilized on a day to day basis. This was proved just by calculating the numbers. :: incredibly ineffective. :: Allen Jackson is not suitable for this class. He very confusing in what he wants us to do and how to do them. He puts people on the spot and makes them answer questions they don't know the answer to. It is hard to pay attention in this class as he is very scatter brained and gets frustrated easily. :: Bad, did not know the answers to his own questions"
2743,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: I guess. :: yes. :: No, I still don't know how he plans to give our final grades because the syllabus is inaccurate. :: The homework, yes.  I wish our reports had things highlighted. :: Terrible. :: The syllabus assigned seemingly arbitrary point values to certain assignments throughout the semester. All assignments were evaluated per the syllabus with one major exception. The evaluation criteria for the two formal lab reports was extremely unclear. No rubric was used by Dr. Jackson when he graded these reports, and points were deducted without explanation. :: idk. :: No, often graded on what he said was correct instead of what was taught in class or what the book states. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, work was evaluated based on how it was described. :: expectation were not well defined and the course structure changed constantly. :: There were really any exceptions on what we would be evaluated on. :: Yes"
2744,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Always. :: There was almost always a technical difficulty which delayed the class anywhere from five to twenty minutes. Dr. Jackson did use the whole class time. :: late a few times. :: yes. :: No, I came to class at least 10 minutes late everyday and he still didn't start for about 5 minutes after I got there. :: Yes. :: Absolutely Terrible. :: Class routinely started 5 to 10 minutes late due to some sort of ""IT issue"". While computer problems did exist, I believe the IT issues were also due to Dr. Jackson's inability to operate a computer. He had difficulty opening programs such as excel and displaying the correct information on the projector. This caused countless delays throughout class. :: no. :: Often class started late and much of the class period was wasted on ""issues"" he was having with his computer. Did not upload lecture notes before the class period and expected them to be followed as he moved to quickly. :: yes. :: generally. :: He often arrived 10 minutes or more late. :: Yes. :: Yes class mostly started on time except for when he had technical difficulties that lasted sometimes for over half an hour. :: no. :: No. :: Yes"
2745,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Asked us if we had questions sometimes, and seemed upset if no one had anything to ask him. He often times ridiculed us for this, inferring that we're a bunch of know-it-alls. It was actually really frustrating. A lot of us did ahve questions, but we didn't even know what to ask, and were afraid to get called out for asking a seemingly stupid question. :: He did not. Dr. Jackson went on to lecture and read from powerpoint slides. Examples were from the solution manual and were not always correct. There was no interest how the students were learning. :: ok. :: Did not give me an interest in learning this course. :: He didn't. Anytime someone answered his questions they got shamed. :: He would usually lecture us on real-world applications and problems.  He'd sometimes ask us questions, and other times pseudo-yell at us for not understanding.  He had us work together on some problems. :: Terribly. :: Dr. Jackson agreed to meet both after class and during office hours to further explain the material. I do believe the instructor wanted us to learn and thought the material was important for our education. :: Very little interest, even made it a point to say that if we failed this class we would be stuck taking it again with him next semester as he is the only teacher. He is here to get paid not to teach, has no interest in the students learning and only wants you to absorb what he says not understand it. :: yes, he was describing the practical impact of the content. :: attempt to connect to real world examples but overall failed to be meaningful even to those of us with actual work/internship/research/co-op experience. :: He didn't really. :: Nice PowerPoint slides. :: He didn't. Class was very boring and lengthy, and the material that was taught wasn't shown to be applicable in any situation. :: The instructor went off on pointless tangents that made no sense because no one understood what point he was trying to make. :: He really didn't. :: No, he would often belittle people for asking a question or answering something incorrectly"
2746,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Okay. :: He communicated well both inside and outside of the classroom, utilizing emails for outside of class. :: ok. :: good. :: Tangents constantly. :: Well. :: Terribly.  Could not use pilot. :: Assignments were very unclear and never put into writing which created some confusion. :: ineffectively. :: Hardly any communication. Had trouble answering students questions and would not respond promptly to any emails. Several days between email responses if there was a response at all. :: He was helpful outside of class. The in-class time was spent listening to him lecture. :: Poorly, unfocused lectures and emails were often not responded to. :: Poorly. :: Well. :: He was surprisingly good at communicating outside of class but inside of class he was not. He would randomly rant and get mad at students in the lecture which made it hard to ask questions. He seems like a nice guy but not a good teacher. :: There was some communication outside of class when needed. :: not very well. :: Poorly, for over half of the semester, I was not included in the overall class emails sent out. I would email him and wait days for a response, if I even received one."
2747,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. Probably the most disorganized class I've taken here. Please, PLEASE, get a new textbook. :: The course was not organized well. Started from the back of the book, jumped around after that, and then went to the beginning chapters. The material itself did not seem to flow well together and that made the whole class feel discombobulated and lost. :: ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh some what. :: sometimes when the computer was working. :: No, he went off on tangents every class. :: Yea, for the most part. :: Not at all. :: The content was extremely unorganized. The class was comprised of both power point slides and example problems. The power points contained many typos and generally looked unprofessional. It was clear that Dr. Jackson did not work through the example problems on his own before class. He simply took a page out of the solution manual and read what was written on the page. He was unable to explain almost all questions due to a lack of understanding of the material. A common phrase he used when someone asked a question regarding how to solve a problem was, ""don't ask me; I'm not a mathematician!"". :: not at all. :: Extremely disorganized, often power points do no appear correctly on pilot, lectures did not follow the course schedule. We jumped around on material and did not make sense in the order we went to. :: yes accept for anything that came out of the book. :: No - unclear and disorganized. :: No. He never uploaded the powerpoints to pilot prior to class but would expect us to follow along as we struggled to scribble down the 30 term equation. :: Yes. :: NO NOT AT ALL. :: no.  Powerpoints were unprofessional and hard to follow. :: No he yelled at us once because he didn't have the power point up once and no one knew what was going on. :: No"
2748,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Did not attend office hours. :: meh. :: yes. :: Yes. :: NO. :: Myself and several of my classmates had questions regarding a formal lab report he had assigned us to write over Thanksgiving break. We emailed him these questions, but he did not respond. Since the answers to these questions were vital to completing the assignment, all progress had to be stopped until the day before the paper was due. I asked Dr. Jackson if he had received my email a few days after break had ended, and he responded that he had not had a chance to open his email yet. :: Hardly any availability outside the classroom, and even if you did go see him he is of very little help. No responsiveness online. :: yes. :: Barely - emails were not effective ways to communicate and office hours were somewhat helpful. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he actually made time for the students, as I mentioned nice guy just not a good professor. :: yes. :: Yes"
2749,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Jackson is nice guy. Can he teach well? Absolutely not. I would never take a class with him again. I'm sure he's very knowledgeable when it comes to instrumentation, but he didn't communicate any of that to us this semester. I actually feel like I wasted tuition on this class. :: Dr. Jackson did not teach this class well. The material was confusing and he talked in circles sometimes which made it worse. He would read equations from the powerpoints, but not give meaning behind them or even so much as always tell us what the variables represented. I am still unsure as to what the take away from this class was supposed to be. Even the example problems were confusing and he did not clarify them well or have the correct answer all the time. And when some people would ask questions, there would be tangents and more confusion for everyone and he essentially did not answer the question. Overall, a disappointing class. :: Santa???. :: Do not like learning from power points. Can't buy the book used in the class. not enough examples. When doing examples he had to use the solution manual to solve the problems. :: This was probably a computer glitch. He shouldn't be able to teach in this decade. Does not know how to use technology CATS was here all the time for simple issues. :: Personally, I think the class should be overhauled.  The source material is utter garbage.  It's not only Wright State students that think so based on the reviews I've read online.  I think that there should be a more definitive goal for learning.  The most of what I learned in this class were statistics and some signal analysis.  Most of everything else ""learned"" is absolute trash.  I feel like I learned more about uncertainty and deviation from other lab classes.  This class simply reiterates and tries to expand on it without being an actual lab class.  What is the core subject matter of this class?  Mathematics?  Science?  When will I use this stuff/how is it different from what I've learned in Chemistry lab?  Physics lab?  Crystallography lab?  What about what I've learned at the labs at my work?  I have seen/used nothing from this class in an actual lab.  I don't see the point of this class, I don't understand why it is on Mechanical and Material Science Engineers' curriculum.  I feel like I've wasted time and money on this class, and it's not Prof. Jackson's fault. :: Dr. Jackson is a terrible professor.   He seems smart but can convey any information to students.  I will never take him again. :: Below I have outlined several problems with Dr. Jackson's teaching style and how I believe they can be improved. 1. PowerPoint slides can be used to display information, but should not be the primary means of teaching. No one is interested in listening to a professor read information that they could simply read on their own. I believe the class-time would be better used with active learning activities. This could include giving us a problem to spend a few minutes working on our own, and then you could go over the answer.  2. Sometimes you asked questions in class and went around the room asking us to answer the questions. Several answers were usually proposed, but you rarely identified which answer was correct and why. 3. When demonstrating excel formulas and operations, it would be helpful if you allowed the class to click along and create the excel sheet with you. Many students learn by doing something themselves rather than simply watching another person complete the task. 4. Since you have taught this class before, you knew that students often have issues understanding the difference between Nyquist frequency and rate. However, you decided to not inform us of this common mistake and the true definitions of the terms until after we had submitted our lab report on the topic. Up until this point in the class, the words ""frequency"" and ""rate"" had been used interchangeably. However, after the lab report it suddenly became extremely important to use the correct term. Please try to be very careful with your terminology used in class and point out differences in seemingly synonymous words if they commonly cause issues to students.  5. The lab reports need to be graded with a rubric, which clearly defines why all points were deducted and how the paper could be improved. Your grading consisted of highlighting a few phrases and then taking off however many points felt right in that moment. This leaves the students with absolutely zero feedback on how the paper can be improved and leaves them guessing as to why the points were even deducted in the first place.  6. On one occasion, you let us work through a problem on the board for nearly thirty minutes before telling us the problem included a typo making it unsolvable. To make the situation worse, you spent this entire time working to explain the question to one student (and those who could huddle around) and left the other 60 students in the class completely lost. If you give us a question to do in class, you should work through it on your own beforehand. This will allow you to catch any typos and save us from wasting time will you figure out how to solve the problem. :: needs to retire. :: One of the most disorganized classes I have taken at Wright State. The professor does not help when needed and is extremely difficult to understand. He gets upset if you do not understand the material he is teaching without assisting in your understanding. The class itself is extremely confusing and hard to follow and a short explanation on each chapter is all that is provided.  The book does not help understand the subject either, it actually makes it more difficult. Exam practice problems are not provided and when they are theres hardly any solutions. :: was looking forward to this course but was ultimately disappointed. :: Every single time Jackson had a problem he blamed it on technology. He had to call CATS every class for half the semester. His explanations were horrendous. :: Jackson is a nice person he just isn't a very good professor. I wouldn't recommend taking him for this class, or the class needs to be restructured as material is difficult to grasp and is unorganized. :: This class was not particularly difficult and I do believe the subject is important but the professor made it unnecessarily complicated and frustrated every single class.  Class lectures were never useful which could be shown by the pitiful class attendance every class. :: Listen, he might be great for other classes but he is awful for this one. This class was the biggest joke and I haven't learned a thing. He tells us almost everyday that he will never get on any boat/plane/train/etc that we have created because he knows it won't be safe. We don't know what to do to be right, we only know how we are wrong"
2750,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson has a very weak understanding of the student's he's teaching. Often times he'll speed through his PowerPoint lectures and leave students way behind. (Just an FYI, a majority of students including myself DESPISE PowerPoint lectures). I'm guessing he feels insecure around the students since he yelled at the class a few times like we were in high school all over again.  At any rate, I didn't take away a whole lot of instrumentation skills from this class, and I actually feel like I wasted my tuition. I should've just gone over to University of Dayton or something. I work at the base, and I was hoping I could pick up some useful instrumentation skills like my co-workers from other institutions. That didn't really happen.. If there's one thing Wright State University is lacking (and this is coming from my experience working with other students from other universities at the base), it's instrumentation skills. I will probably be fine learning these skills at work, but what about my fellow Wright State students? As of right now, they don't have a place to learn these skills, and that really puts a damper on their resume. :: joke. :: He was not effective in the lecture or lab part. He was unclear as to what he wanted in lab or lab reports, it was very confusing. :: Lab did not really help us learn how to apply topics in class because we were never really sure what we were learning in class. :: h. :: always seemed to have computer trouble in the room we met in. :: Better during the lab than lecturing. :: Yea. :: Very ineffective. Had to do all required learning for exams and homework on own. Jackson foley read off of powerpoint slides for instruction purposes, and when asked to work through example problems in class, he would pull up the solution manual and give zero explanation for why the problem was being solved that way. :: Dr. Jackson was a horrible instructor.  He has no idea how to present information in an effective manner. :: same as nonlab class. :: Dr. Jackson was not the most effective instructor. His use of Powerpoint to go through the information caused many to fall asleep and not pay attention. Towards the middle of the semester, many students including Honors students began skipping his class simply because they were not learning anything from his teaching. He seems like a really nice man, but his teaching style was not one that fit very many --if any-- of the students in his class. :: Santa's overall effectiveness is was not very great. I walked away most days clueless of what i ""learned"" in the lecture. :: Dr. Jackson did well and was helpful during his office hours. My only suggestion would be to prepare examples in a more legible and clear manner. The text book has more errors than any other book I have used in college, therefore it would optimize class time to be able to cover more examples without errors. :: My classmates and I would like to bring to your attention that instruction received in this semesterâs section of ME3600 has been below any acceptable standards for an engineering course. I understand this course has some difficult concepts and is, in part new material, but the method in which Dr. Jackson has covered the material has been consistently unclear, contradictory and generally confusing to the class. The following is a partial list of examples or cases in which unsatisfactory instruction has been received. 1. Routine failure to answer specific questions regarding concepts, equations, or constants.	This is in both email and in person conversations. On multiple occasions, Dr. Jackson has walked away from a table before either answering the question or his sentence. Questions posed during class often cannot be answered by students due to too many qualifying conditions that would severely change the outcome of the question asked. In one such example, we were asked to determine the kinds of signal inputs by a given device/action. One of the devices was an input by a carâs cruise control function. This was followed up by a classmate asking if it was electronic or mechanical and also if the input was the control being set, run, or cancelled. Upon being asked Dr. Jackson replied by asking him was a frequency was. Then proceeded to walk away while continuing to talk without answering either of my classmateâs questions.  2. Unclear lab manual. The lab manual (per Dr. Jackson) has been âwritten and rewritten multiple times but people still donât understand what I am looking for.â Despite this the lab manual is missing many steps in its procedure that can only be found by asking a TA if we happen to think something is missing, or can be entirely missed as there was no explicit line in the procedure. For a class discussing the actualities of laboratory operations and data processing this does not reflect well to the skills and practices we are supposedly being taught to follow.  3. Unprofessional behavior in class. On 23 October 2018, Dr. Jackson chastised the class for its particularly low attendance that day despite the fact he was only speaking to those in the class who were in attendance that day accomplishing exactly nothing by doing so. On 30 October, he chastised the class for not recalling an equation from a 55 slide powerpoint that he forgot/neglected to put on pilot before class despite his intention of doing so.  4. General lack of ability to convey information clearly or precisely. This is partly a result of powerpoints with just as much, if not more extraneous information than necessary information with no indication as to what is necessary or relevant to future problems, labs or courses. This is also partly a result of few concepts being displayed and mostly explained in long stretches of incorrect examples from the real world, questions about the concepts we cannot answer since he has not fully explained the concept yet and finally, asking us to recall information he told us previous can be completely disregarded for the course. The latter of which concerned Nyquist frequency and Nyquist Rate the latter of which was told to be disregarded. Then after a confusion in the class about the Nyquist frequency many weeks later, he asked us to recall the Nyquist Rate, the very thing he told us to disregard. Now the confusion surrounding the Nyquist frequency was built upon the fact the nobody in the class could come up with a correct definition from notes or from a powerpoint to use in a lab report. As a result, we looked for reputable online sources as required by the lab manual and encouraged by Dr. Jackson. It was only after turning in the lab reports did Dr. Jackson bring to our attention that even among reputable sources, a singular definition could be corroborated and marking down those who used an âincorrect definition.â  Presentation of this information in a clear and consistent manner - as in clearly laid out in a powerpoint and in lecture as well as advanced notice of the lack of clarity in the greater literature.  These issues on their own my classmates and I understand are part of the learning process between professor and student which we are well acquainted with, being in at least out 3rd year at Wright State. However, the aggregate of these issues produces a lack of comprehension for most of the material in this course as well as causing a general lack of interest due to these inconsistencies. :: Moderately poor. :: Good. :: Not very effective at all. Labs were hard to follow and disorganized. :: Ineffective. :: not effective. :: Poor"
2751,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- For the most part, yes. :: Yes, he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yea. :: Jackson was very inconsistent in the evaluation and grading of work. Especially when it came to exams. When comparing scoring among other students in the class, multiple discrepancies were found with the grading. When taking these discrepancies to Jackson, he became agitated with the students and told them that was the way it was and that they must not have understood the material. :: Yes and no.  He does not have any rubrics for the lab reports.  He wrote a few comments and then slapped a grade on it.  The homework grades made no sense and was not returned in a timely fashion. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Always had at least one contradiction in the lab manual. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes but the expectations were not well defined. :: yes but they were super confusing. :: Yes"
2752,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- All the time. :: The class usually started ten minutes late because he had trouble setting up the material needed for labs. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yea. :: He was more than ten minutes late on more than one occasion. :: Dr. Jackson was routinely late and got off topic way too much. :: Santa's clock must have been off or couldn't get his reindeer to fire up because we would start late about once a week. :: yea. :: Most of the time - often late. :: Usually late. :: Yes. :: Yes, unless there were technical difficulties that took 30 minutes or so to solve. :: no. :: no. :: No, he often started the labs late, which was bad because there was already a time crunch"
2753,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He would sometimes ask if we had questions..he didn't have good answers for them all the time but at least he would ask. :: He did not. I think I talked to Dr. Jackson at most three times during the lab session. TA's usually assisted my group. :: Didn't demonstrate interest in my learning. Uses power point slides to teach class which I do not like. :: Explained topics that had nothing to do with the class and said it would help us in the future. :: Yea. :: Jackson was very condescending about our learning on multiple occasions. He seemed to be more concerned that had to teach this class at all than if the students actually took anything away from the class. He very much seemed to be just going through the motions of this class, putting in as little effort as possible. :: He did not.  He would question our ability to do simple math. :: He was available outside of class to help answer questions. :: Attempting to connect to actual engineering problems however, many of these are edge cases or are problems that are no longer relevant in engineering work as experienced by most who have done engineering work in internships co-ops and talking to professionals whom we have worked with, with statements of ""I have never dealt with anything like that in my career"" and ""I have not had any of those problems in my work; any malfunctioning equipment was either professionally calibrated or replaced."". :: Shamed us for answering questions if we didn't give the exact answer he wanted. :: Assisted well on labs with TA's. :: He didn't, to be honest lab seemed like a waste of my time, I didn't learn a lot except for how to write a lab report. :: no. :: he didnt. :: He didn't, he wouldn't answer a question straightly, everything was a roundabout answer."
2754,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Fine. Prompt email replies. Very nice gentlemen. :: There was no communication outside of the classroom. Inside the classroom, he communicated fine. :: communicated good. :: Rarely sent emails. :: Yea. :: I never bothered to waste my time to try and communicate with him in or out of the classroom. :: Terribly.  Dr. Jackson is completely rude and is a terrible communicator.  Can not use pilot or email effectively. :: Labs really sucked for this class. There was always some sort of confusion. :: His class time was less clear because you had to sit and listen. For me this, is not how I learn best, however that is particular to me. Outside of class Dr. Jackson was very helpful. :: Emails from students were not often replied to in a timely manner, often not covered until the relevance of the email has passed. Emails that were replied to were often unsatisfactory in their answers to specific questions about class topics. :: In class, he made sure to shame anyone who answered his questions. :: Well. :: Pretty well. :: communication outside of class was typically slow and not helpful. :: Not well at all. He was bad at giving instructions and either moved way too fast or too slow. :: Poorly, barely emailed back"
2755,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. Please get a new textbook. Maybe see what other institutions like University of Dayton are doing? There needs to be more coherence and definitely more application to the concepts we're learning. I would love to see a thermocouple lab or even a pressure transducer lab be put together. ALSO, there should be a more thorough guide to LabVIEW included in the lab manual so that students don't have to watch Dr. Jackson very closely to make sure we don't miss a step while he's doing it on the projector screens. I was also hoping that there would be more LabVIEW in this class. That's another thing Wright State students seem to be lacking when compared to other schools: LabVIEW skills. My company uses so much LabVIEW and students from University of Cincinnati and University of Dayton are prepared to use LabVIEW in the workplace, but I don't feel like this was a strong enough lecture series. Maybe the MME department could throw together a LabVIEW course where we use LabVIEW to work on different instrumentation projects? Like using LabVIEW with strain guages or even with Motion Control devices? Whatever the MME dept does, there needs to be more integration of LabVIEW into the ME curriculum. :: No, topics were all over the place and that also leads into the lab as well. We went in order of the syllabus, but that was the extent of it. :: Good when the computer was working. :: No we never really knew what was needed to complete the lab. :: Yea. :: Absolutely not. He would jump from powerpoint to an example problem and then ask the class a question just to be condescending and tell the student they were wrong. He also would never explain why they were wrong, or give a clear answer to the problem/question he asked. :: No, his power points were absolutely terrible.  He would often go off on tangents about something that was not applicable. :: Santa's powerpoints were well organized but the way he went through the lectures made the material hard to understand. :: The lecture slides were well organized, the book is poor and the problems in the book are also poor. :: No - Please indicate which equations/concepts are background/cursory information and which are directly dealt with by in class/homework/exam problems. Power points are too long with too much unnecessary information and ought to be condensed.  This also makes homework be a matter of looking for a specific equation in a powerpoint take more time than the actual problem itself.  Lectures also feel too rambly and unfocused - please separate topics and then connect them when fully understood by the class or fully covered. Currently, topics are being connected to others before being fully explained confuses most or even all students. Connecting a bunch of partially understood topics is not helpful to greater understanding. Methodically cover topics in a top down approach. Topics start out too broad and are brought down specifically too quickly. :: No, he never had the documents uploaded that he said he did. :: Yes. :: NO NOT AT ALL. :: not even a little. :: no, half the time no one knew what was going on and he was no hope when it came to questions. very disorganized. :: No"
2756,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. Always had prompt email responses. :: Did not go to office hours. :: yes. :: Yea. :: No. :: yes. :: In person meetings were the most helpful for clarification, email certainly was not. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes during office hours but meetings were typically not helpful. :: Yes"
2757,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. J is a wonderful human being, but I would never take a class with him again. He's just too disorganized and there's not enough good lecture content being conveyed clearly. :: The TA's of this course was of zero help in the lab section, which is where they were used most. Asking for help and the response most of the time was, ""I am not sure how Dr. Jackson got that"" or there was attitude because the whole class was confused and they had to help. The male TA (I cannot recall his name) seemed to be the only one who was insightful beyond Dr.Jackson and knew how to use the instruments and what Dr. Jackson wanted in reports. The TA's were as lost as we were and did not know what was required to turn in for the lab reports and formal lab reports. Dr. Jackson and TA's also did not show a consistency with grading labs. TA's would walk around with the textbook or lab solution and then be confused as to how to help us in either labVIEW or in general when there was a question about a graph or topic required for the lab. Again, Dr. Jackson would talk in tangents and he did not clarify the material in any aspect, and the TA's were confused on material and requirements as well. The male TA was the only insightful one the majority of the time. It is infuriating to spend five hours a week in a class that was confusing and not helpful, even the assistants were not helpful and got frustrated early on in labs. :: Didn't seem to be able to show how to do example problems without the solution manual. :: He just needs to be done teaching. His handwriting is unreadable and he cannot relate to the students at all. He just needs to restructure the course or someone else should teach this material. I did not learn anything. :: Yea. :: Dr. Jackson is a terrible professor.  I hope I never have him again.  He is rude and obviously racist.  He should be let go. :: My same comments stated in the lecture also apply to the lab. I would like to add that the labs were especially chaotic and confusing. Neither the professor or the TAs knew how to do all parts of the lab or interpret the instructions. :: I should have brought brought milk and cookies to get a better grade. :: I understand this is not the most interesting topic to teach or learn, but this class was overall ineffective in conveying topics in a meaningful way. Topics were understood to a limited degree with little usefulness outside the class. :: Teaching abilities are non-existent. :: Lab was a waste of time, and was worth a lot of our over all grade for it being worth 0 hours towards our overall credits. :: Instructor is ineffective and can never give a strait answer making the class incredibly frustrating. :: He is so unorganized and sometimes didn't have enough supplies for lab. Oh but it was never his fault, no he counted.. twice (this is sarcasm if you can't tell). So its our fault there is not enough supplies, not his. We just have to join another group we have never worked with before. I also don't enjoy him randomly yelling at us for no reason. He likes to yell at us about how we all skip class to the students who are in class. So he punishes us for others not showing up to lab"
2758,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Pretty effective. :: Good, He gave a clear instruction on all of the equipment and a lab manual. :: Good. :: He's thorough but is often unclear. For this course, several groups of students complained that what he said was the expectation for the lab reports was not necessarily what was graded. :: Good. :: I didn't learn anything. :: Professor was effective at teaching us the need material to complete the labs."
2759,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- At the beginning, the TA was pretty harsh on the grading, but it seemed to calm down after that. :: Yes the grading procedure was clear but the TA who graded seemed to be a bit picky for minor things that shes took more off than what we think she should have. :: The instructor doesnt even evaluate the work, his TA or LA does, and that person grades based off some random syllabus that is not provided to the rest of the class.  Routinely the grades were effected and labs were graded harshly even when they met the instructors requirements because the TA was able to do whatever they wanted. :: Sort of. :: The TA did not, in some cases we were punished for not having sources when the only source that we needed for our lab report was the lab manual itself. This particularly happened on the first lab. If you expect extra sources for something that is not needed to properly analyzed the lab data, then it should be stated in the report requirements for the individual lab. :: Hardly any work was needed. :: Yes, the professors syllabus was layed out nicely and clearly stated what he expected."
2760,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, but this is a lab class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No. And sometimes he couldn't figure out how to use the machinery. :: Yes, was always on time and we were allowed to leave class once we had completed the lab."
2761,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He made sure everybody fully understood what was going on, and if someone had a question, he answered it as best as he could. :: He provided good demos of the equipment and responded to emails. :: yes. :: Helping with the labs. :: He didn't not. Would often talk about how much he hates Wright State and administration. :: Professor did a good job of connecting with his students on a personal level. Would ask about other classes and not just his own. Always found a way to be teaching us something, even if we were just talking about our daily lives."
2762,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Pretty well. :: Good, he responded to my emails. :: well. :: Well enough. :: fine. :: He made us watch YouTube videos. :: The professor was excellent at communicating with email and office hours."
2763,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes the lab manual was very helpful as long as you came to class and listened to what Jackson wanted. :: yes, with the exception of the lab reports, which are a nightmare based on what the instructor asks for and what is actually graded. :: It's a really straightforward. Show up, do lab, write report. :: Yes. :: I still dont know if I have a final exam. :: Were not many lectures due to this being a lab. Lab manual was organized and gave good background information of the topics for each lab."
2764,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: -. :: No. :: Excellent"
2765,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- My only concern was that it took forever for us to get our grades back. So it was hard to judge what I needed to fix for my next report, since I didn't have the feedback from the previous one yet. :: You really should do a peer evaluation for this class, I know we ""picked"" our groups but I didn't pick my members and got stuck with the left overs. Between the four of us another member and myself did 80% of the labs and reports, one of the other two never did a single lab and the other in my option has no business in engineering, he would show up to the group and all he wanted to do was play video games while we worked and I'm not sure he knows some of the basic concepts for this lab. Other than that I enjoyed this class, It was nice to do some hands on work that apply's to all the theory we do in classes here. Good seeing you again. :: no. :: It would be nice to know if we are having a final and what it will cover. As of 12/5/18, we do not know and wont know until 12/6/18. This is very stressful for the final semester of my degree. :: Why is he even teaching?. :: Great professor that truly cares about his students."
2766,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Jackson was very helpful when needed to be. :: good. :: Somewhat effective. :: Perfectly fine. :: He is not an effective instructor, he says one thing and means another, he does not know how to get anything ordered or how to pay for things, he is basically not a useful source of information for senior design. :: Not really effective. :: Dr. Jackson did well instructing this class. The many issues I had about this class were not due to him but the overall structure of the class. :: He was very inconsistent in the way he taught us. What he would tell one group is different than what was told to another group. :: Dr. Jackson was very effective. He helped make the papers and topics easier to understand. He was also always there whenever we (Capstone group) needed him. :: Effective. :: He did not teach many lectures, only gave some feedback on presentation and turned in proposal. He has mentioned that teaching this capstone class was sprung on him suddenly. This showed throughout the semester. Considering this, I find that he did the best he could. BUT.. I do not know what he has direct control over (i.e. guest presenters, lecture topics, and assignments). I find that the lectured material to not contribute to my capstone project, or prepare me for the work force. The guest presenters are more like 'a professor from CECS', that covered concepts from Structure and Properties of Materials, Experimental Measurements and Instrumentation, Technical Communication, and English composition. But I do not know whether or not Dr. Jackson had control over these things."
2767,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes,. :: good. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: His syllabus and what he grades on are historically different.  He also allows his TA or LA to do all of his grading, even of his exams, and does not give them proper instruction so they grade based off whatever they want. :: I guess. The expectations cover such a broad spectrum that any work is bound to fit what they are looking for. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He barely evaluated our work. We had to ask him to read through our stuff to make sure we were doing what was required. :: He did. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2768,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes when time was in his hands, often had guest speakers. :: good. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, it lasted until the end of class, or until the guest lecturer had finished. :: Yes. :: Dr. Jackson routinely started class exactly on time and used the entire class time. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2769,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- inquisitive and interested in the project. :: good. :: Weekly group meetings. :: Not a very applicable question. :: Yes. :: He really didn't. :: Provided materials and resources necessary for our projects. :: He offered help when the class had questions. :: He didn't. :: He did. :: Had regular meetings to ensure we were on track for our project. :: I do not recall Dr. Jackson giving lectures. When he had my capstone team meet with him, he would ask questions to help prevent the team from falling apart (i.e. Is anybody having problems with communication? Anybody have problems with a team member?) I do not recall using his feedback to solve any problems encountered in my capstone project. I recall using Dr. Jackson's feedback to improve my team's proposal and presentation. I find 'interest' to be vague, but Dr. Jackson did engage with students regardless of whether the students used his advice or not."
2770,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did a good job,. :: good. :: Somewhat effectively. :: Fairly effectiv. :: Well. :: Communication was a joke. :: 7/10. :: Yes he was available for group meetings and via email. :: Not well. :: Dr. Jackson answered every email in a timely manner and spoke clearly in the classroom. :: Effective. :: Well enough. There were times where there was a note on one of the two lecture rooms that said we are meeting in the other room. But thanks to modern communication, students were able to notify their classmates of room changes."
2771,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Sure, its Senior Design so not much to it. :: good. :: yes. :: No. Very unorganized, though this was an instance of the department changing things without notifying the students for the most part. :: The course content is a waste of time.  It is a repeat of Tech-Comm with more useless information and presentations. :: No. This was the least organized class I have ever taken. Jackson is so disorganized on Pilot that it honestly makes me laugh. Constantly uploading documents with dates from other semesters, not having things on Pilot that are NEEDED for class completion, not having documents available to us while the other professor in the class is completely organized. :: Yes. :: No. The class was very disorganized. This was mostly due to the department and not because of the professor. To start with, less than a month before the semester started, the department realized that in needed a new section and required people to switch sections. This could have easily been foreseen. When the new section was then formed, the department went about attempting to divide groups that had already been working on their projects for at least a semester. Personally, my group had been working on our project since January and only remained as one group working on this project due to our adviser contacting the department. Most of the lectures had little or nothing to do with working on the project. Throughout the entire semester, there were only four or five useful lectures. The schedule for the class changed multiple times throughout the semester, as did the classroom. This made it quite difficult to know when assignments were actually due and where class would be held. :: He never ran the lectures. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Content was well organized."
2772,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Jackson was available and responded to questions readily. :: Yes. :: Dr. Jackson was very responsive online and I did not use his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2773,Allen Jackson,2018 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- nope, just SD, not much to evaluate. :: none. :: This class was such a joke. I understand why this class is needed, but damn. What a waste of time. :: No. :: Dr. Jackson did well instructing this class. My main complaints are due to departmental problems and not him. :: Dr. Jackson has a lot of experience in working in the professional setting and has a lot of useful hints when it comes to writing a proposal but he is also inconsistent in what he tells us. We struggled to write our proposal because he was telling us different things to include and not include in it. :: I would to thank Dr. Jackson for a great semester. :: Here is some solutions to the criticism I have given: 1. Because seniors are supposed to be encouraged to complete their project on time and within budget (because they are externally funded), teaching content that helps them solve their project problems would be more useful of lecture time. The reasoning for this is that I assume alot of time is spent in preparing the lectures vs. unplanned office visits with students. From my perspective, I would rather learn things related to the design, manufacturing, and testing stages (i.e. Computer aided design with FEA, manufacturing resources available at school with examples of when you should utilize them, and system integration for fluid, signal, and mechanical control). If I find that I am lacking in Word skills and interpersonal communication, I believe Dr. Jackson would be willing to give me some pointers during his scheduled office hours. By doing this, you would no longer be catering to the lowest denominator/setting low expectations (If an employer forced myself and other new employees to sit through a 'How to use Microsoft Word' after showing them my transcript, I would think they are joking). When I started college, I thought real engineers developed, manufactured, and applied solutions to any problem they are given. This is supported by the skills early leaders in technology possessed prior to their scientific breakthroughs: The Wright Brothers - both had experience making printing presses and making bicycles prior to pursuing aviation. Yes, they did exhaust all the literature in the local library studying up on the current art, but they combined that with practical fabrication techniques to build prototypes, wind tunnels, and aircraft. And with WSU not requiring students to participate in internships/co-ops, a student doing only the coursework offered to complete a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering will lack experience in applying solutions. They will have plenty of experience with solving pen-and-paper problems that do not require them to build and test their solution. So, I recommend that Dr. Jackson utilize the work experience and research experience he has to enhance the course (i.e. methods of reading and writing signals from instruments with hardware/software available at school, show the benefits of solutions that follow the K.I.S.S. principle). The reason for this lengthy, monotonous, diatribe is that my teammates (some of them are in engineering honor societies) have to be led by the nose when working on the capstone project because they have not been forced to connect tubing for fluid flow, connect sensors and flow controllers to a computer, make a labview program on their own that reads, manipulates, displays, and writes signals to and from devices, and ask people and scout out rooms to find spare tools/material to complete a task. I picked my team out because I worked on simpler projects with them and knew some of them have 4.0. But even the 4.0 student can not even perform these tasks. This resulted in me doing the design work, electrical work, most of the machining, most of the assembly, some of the purchasing, and all of the programming. Because of this, it is apparent that I need to 'educate' my teammates in doing these things. But since I already have a job and classes to focus on, I would like to see Capstone I and II help pick up the slack by teaching LabVIEW, SolidWorks, fabrication, and electrical systems."
2774,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- effective. :: Knowledgeable instructor. :: He was not a good teacher. He read straight from the slides and went on tangents about anything random. Class was a waste of time when I could have read everything from the book. :: Somewhat effective. :: He is alright, kind of reads the book from slides. :: effective. :: Decent. :: Very effective. Good professor who knows what he is teaching. :: Terrible. :: Great professor. :: I liked Dr. Lieh, but his teaching is very dry and hard to sit through. :: Hard to understand and lectures from slides packed with information directly from the textbook. :: Dr. Lieh was very effective in teaching the machining course.  His lectures were very detailed and followed along with the textbook. :: The professor could improve on explaining lecture concepts and material. During class he would just read directly from slides on the screen and when an example problem came up, he would hurriedly have students write down the answers posted on the screen. This method did not help me learn and understand the material. A lot of the time I had to teach myself a lot of the material due to him not explaining the material at all during lectures. He can definitely improve on how the class is taught so students can obtain the knowledge more easily. :: Very effective. :: Not very effective. Did not learn much."
2775,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Expectations were not specifically clear, in regards to final video and presentation. :: Yes. :: Yes, but it took forever to get any grades back and we had to pick up our homework just to see our grades. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: No. :: I think so. I haven't received all of my grades and don't really know what I will get in the class, but hoping for an A. :: Yes. :: Yes, all assignments were listed and described in the syllabus. :: Yes, the professor graded us on all of the guidelines that were placed in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. :: Yes. :: Yes"
2776,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Used an effective amount of class time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Let out early most times. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did start every class on time. :: No. :: Always on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The instructor always started class on time and would use the time that was required for that class period. He would not waste students' time by holding them over if he didn't have more content to go over that day. :: Yes. :: No he thought it was a rip off that we only got 3 credit hours when the class was three hours a week and the lab was two hours a week. He often cut the time short, but I agree with his reasoning so I do not blame him."
2777,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- made class engaging and often gave in class exercises to keep people focused. :: No, I learned  more from the lab then the class. This theory is not applicable to the ""real world"",. :: He didn't much, though I wonder if its due slightly to a a language barrier. :: answering question during and after class. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: He did not. :: Very animated and likes to ask students questions. :: He planned a shop tour of Minco for real life experience. :: He ask many questions in class to help trigger our learning. :: He would ask questions during class and would answer questions during office hours. :: Yes"
2778,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: Needs to learn to use Pilot more effectively. :: Responded to emails very slowly. :: well. :: very effectively. :: Not effective. :: Very communicative. :: Terrible. :: Answered emails sometimes and didn't always understand questions being asked. :: Hard to understand in class. Emails were short. :: Not so well.  He did post many things to pilot, but did not use full functionality of pilot.  He could have posted grades in pilot which he did not. :: The professor can definitely improve on emailing. He did not respond in an acceptable time frame to emails (sometimes it would be 4 days or so before he responded). Then, in the emails that he would send back, he would give one word answers that would not be enough to answer questions. He needs to work on checking his email more, responding with full responses and explaining material better in class. :: Very well. :: With email decent."
2779,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Would have helped to have the lecture PPTs posted further in advance, but was quite convenient to have them during lecture. :: Lectures were text heavy and examples were rushed. :: Not on the grading, and telling us what he wanted on projects.  But on the lectures yes. :: no. :: yes very laid out. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes they were. :: They were plagiarized from the book. :: Went right from the slides. :: Yes. :: Yes, all lectures followed along with the text book. :: The course content was organized since he simply read off of the slides that he had prepared for class. They were organized classes but not an effective layout to teach students the material. :: Yes for most cases. :: Yes"
2780,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Not significantly. :: Yes. :: No, he never responded to emails that we sent him. :: no. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes he was available when ever we needed him. :: Not at all. Would rarely respond. :: never went to office hours, but people said he was always there. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The professor was in his office during office hours each time that I went there. He would be a little more helpful during office hours but still was not good at explaining the material. For answering questions over email, he was not good at responding with descriptive answers or even  with whole sentences to provide a clear understanding. He needs to improve on emailing back to students and knowing the material of his lectures to help guide students through questions that they have. :: yes. :: Yes"
2781,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 4870,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Take home exams are appreciated but would like to have them graded and handed back in class rather than picking up at TAs office hours. :: Less text content, more examples. Liked exam format, but having a video, paper, AND presentation was excessive. :: Give your students their homework and exams back!!!!. :: He read directly from the slides and the lectures were very boring and pointless. :: I'm unsure of the focus of this class. It seems more focused on the finances of machining moreso than machining itself. :: -. :: Decent. :: No. :: Switch this teacher out for John Lawless. :: fdgbsdfhsths. :: Only reason to come to class is to get participation credit. Otherwise the class portion of machining is not worth showing up for. I didn't have a bad time in this class, but I could have gotten more from it. :: Machining lab was very fun.  I think it could have been done much quicker if machines in lab were not broke down.. :: The professor needs to work on a new way to teach the material in his class, or at least add a different method of going through the material. He should actually write down and go through problems with the class for understanding. The slides can do a nice job of summarizing the book, but they do nothing if they are simply read to the class each semester. The professor can improve on giving students a more hands on learning experience and work on responding to emails in a timely and effective manner. :: not at this time"
2782,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- its good. i. :: I would not recommend this professor.  He does not come to class fully prepared, he does not communicate well, and he does not seem to care about our learning. :: Good"
2783,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: No, he has not evaluated anyone's work at all!  Not only has he released zero grades, I heard he hasn't even viewed anyone's PILOT submissions - not even our final project proposals!  That being said, he doesn't go over homework or test solutions during class, so we have no idea if we did a problem right or wrong!  That is especially frustrating when he includes an old homework problem as part of an exam. :: Yes he is good"
2784,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes.time is spent fully towards the class. :: Not always.  There have been a couple of occasions where he didn't show up until the class period was half-over. :: yes
2785,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He gives challenging problems for the homework. So this enabled me to work more on the subject deeply. :: He hasn't.  In fact, he seems to assume that we already know everything; when we don't know something, he mocks us like the answer is the most obvious thing in the world.  He probably thinks he's being funny, but it's actually pretty demeaning. :: yes, I have learned much I think"
2786,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- he clarifies the doubts in class. or by email,. :: He does not communicate well, even for someone for whom English is a second language.  He didn't remind us of our project proposals at all, except to announce that they would be due in two days.  Neither has he mentioned our project reports or presentations.  Also, he doesn't give us set due dates for our in-class assignments (which he expects us to have finished BEFORE he does them in class). :: Good, He is doing the better"
2787,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes, but he didn't always run through his MATLAB code examples beforehand to make sure they worked. :: Yes. agree"
2788,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. he was there online. :: No.  For example, I e-mailed him with a question about our project proposals, and it took him a week to reply with a simple ""yes."". :: I didn't try"
2789,Junghsen Lieh,2018 Fall,ME 7160,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- nil. :: On the first day of class, he asked us what our thesis topics and jobs were.  Whenever someone said they were doing extra coursework instead of a thesis, or didn't have a job, he yelled at them in a mocking way, like it's just common sense for everyone to be working on grad school, a thesis, and a job all at the same time.  And then he yells at us again when we don't have our IN-class work completed BEFORE class, even though we all say that we're too busy to do it because of the jobs and theses he expects us all to have.  Similarly, in class, he uses car analogies to explain his point, and he expects us all to be experts on cars, like how fast they can go from zero to sixty, how to adjust the suspension, or the efficiency of our cars' engines.  And when we say we don't know these things, he mocks us again in the same way.  In this way, he sometimes comes across as mean. :: Very good"
2790,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Mukhopadhyay was moderately effective in communicating the ideas in the class. :: Pretty effective, I had her for two classes this semester, and she was definitely a better teacher in this course. :: not effective. :: Decently effective, there could have been more review and clear expectations. :: She is very informative and down to earth. :: Not effective in any respect - would refuse to actually answer questions that were asked, instead repeating that we (the students) should ""just do it ourselves"", even when students clarified that they did not understand the fundamental concepts or how to approach a problem. Often did not return evaluated work, leading to large gaps between assignment completion and feedback (1+ months)."
2791,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes - although a little more transparency in the grading system would be appreciated. :: Yes it seemed like it. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No. Assignment content and due dates were often confusing and only communicated verbally in class, and even then in an unclear fashion. Despite attending every lecture I was often confused about what was actually due and when."
2792,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Definitely. :: Yes.
2793,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Trying to connect to actual engineering practices but less than full understanding of the topic reduced the impact of that connection to the topic. :: Class material was explained well. :: She really wants us to understand what she is teaching us but doesn't know how to help us understand. Makes us answer questions and walk through problems we have never seen before and don't know how to do. :: She would meet for office hours and answer your question the second my hand went in the air. :: She would often ask the class questions and showed admirable patience with us. :: She did not - any students who did not understand something were repeatedly ignored. Almost no examples done in class that actually showed how to solve the problem; often only the problem statement and final numerical answer were provided without any or very few intermediate steps. The most clear and helpful days of class were when Dr. Mukhopadhyay was absent and her TA would teach in her place and actually go through examples with us.
2794,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Fairly well. :: She was pretty effective, I visited her a few times for this course, and when I did she was helpful. Sometimes in class however, she would begin a problem and then give up on it, which is very confusing for students. :: She is very approachable but she doesn't really give us exactly what she is looking for. Or what concepts will be on test. She beats around the bush and doesn't answer questions. :: Decently well, some emails were answered immediately, others took a few days. :: Very well. :: Poor communication skills. Would deflect any questions that were asked. At this point I genuinely doubt that she knows the algebraic steps necessary to solve the questions she poses, since she so adamantly refused to show her work when going through examples."
2795,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Lectures were often seemingly random and unorganized - rarely connected meaningfully to other ideas and had too many overlapping ideas being presented at the same time. :: Yes lectures were well organized. :: No, all of her classes where lecture based and things that were written on the board where equations. I get we are supposed to read the book but as someone who has a hard time listening and writing at the same time this really hurt me. She also jumped around a lot with what she was explaining and how she was explaining it. When asked a question her response is always ""you tell me"" we wouldn't be asking questions if we could understand what is going on. :: Sort of. :: Yes. :: No. I learned more from reading the book outside of class and during lecture. It was often unclear what section was even being covered. Notes were all over the place, with very little actual note content being communicated in any form."
2796,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Office hours cancelled fairly often - did not impede ability to get in contact/meet. :: Yes. :: always available during office hours and responsive, again though never really told us what she wanted or how she wanted things done. :: Yes, she cancelled office hours a lot but was willing to meet at different times. :: Yes. :: No - I never visited her during office hours since other students said she would actively avoid answering specific questions there too. Often cancelled office hours for the day at the end of lecture."
2797,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 3750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Lectures need to be more focused and work on one point at a time and making sure that topic is understood and proceed in a way that connects/builds on the previous topic instead of jumping around. Also I understand that writing a lot of complicated/often confusing symbols can lead to mistakes being made, but when we either don't know the material or are watching the math being written with several steps missing (generally that's okay since its mostly algebra/easy calculus) but we have to figure out the steps in order to follow the math which takes some time. Also, a lot of material in class is erased on the board too quickly, even if it is unneeded or can be explained better, the frequency that happens adds confusion to the class. More numerical problems, worked out in full, like when the student came in and did the problems with us, would be very helpful for connecting the ideas in class other than through brute force learning - seeing things so much that we kinda get it only through exposure not understanding. :: Yes I do have one big one. I had Mukhopadhyay for 2 courses this semester, and she made EVERYTHING due on the SAME day as well as exams to be on the same day. Both courses of hers that I took were EXTREMELY time demanding in order to grasp the concepts. My word of advice is if you know that you have students in two of your difficult classes, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE EXAMS ON THE SAME DAY. It is extremely stressful for any student whether full or part time, and prevents you from potentially succeeding in both class. Plus, i'm sure it's a lot of work for the professor to grade more than one thing at a time, so it would in the end benefit us both. :: Shes really sweet but she can't teach. She doesn't understand that we don't know the answers and don't always recall things from previous prerequisite classes. I think people would be able to pass her class in a better way without curving if she gave us a study guide for her exams, power point notes, and not beating around the bush. But hey, shes been here for awhile and shes probably 10 year so anything I say will not be taken into consideration. However, teachers like her are why wright state is loosing money. Because no one wants to come here. :: She did awesome. She is very knowledgeable and she truly cares about the class. :: Dr. Mukhopadhyay blatantly assumed and repeatedly declared that students should be able to recall information from previous thermodynamics coursework, despite the fact that it is not a prerequisite for the course and many students informed her they had no previous thermodynamics experience. Rather than do any work herself to explain a problem, she would just tell us to look back at (nonexistent) notes from previous coursework and assumed that we had access to textbooks associated with other courses. The first quiz was entirely based on content from another textbook from another course, and did not seem to connect to later material covered.  Overall, the content ended up being more chemistry than anything else with little to no explanation provided for any examples or problems. In two and a half years at Wright State, Dr. Mukhopadhyay is by far the worst instructor I have had and I am genuinely astonished she is allowed to teach. Her behavior and complete lack of responsiveness just shows me how little teaching evaluation is done in academia. If she is assigned to instruct any of my future courses, I will actively avoid her and not take them - this is literally money out of Wright State's pocket because of the poor quality instructors they permit to teach."
2798,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Mukhopadhyay trails off her sentences at the end, making it hard to hear what was said, and then laughs after the sentence.  Most of the important information is always at the end of the sentence, but you can never actually hear or understand what is being said.  She also routinely asks students to the board, and then tells them they are doing it wrong and embarrasses them. :: I did not follow anything that was taught in this class. I was very excited to take this class but within the first month of the semester I lost all my excitement. I am an avid note taker and looking back at my notes they are as scattered as her lectures. Her power points were helpful but she didn't post them in a timely manner and I couldn't write fast enough to keep up so I couldn't look back at my notes to study for exams in advance. I missed a couple classes in the middle of the semester and got notes from other students and they were just as scattered as mine. When she wasn't doing power points she would just explain topics and write on the board. I was never able to read her handwriting and it seemed like she would just say important topics and not write them.  Her tests were impossible as well. We were able to have one sheet of notes and I would write my entire notes and her slides and worked out problems on my crib sheet and it was all useless. There were things on the tests she would just briefly explain and then say she wont go more into it and then it would be a major topic on the test. I understand we need to read the book but if I wanted to learn from a book I wouldn't be in college, I'd be in a library. I want to learn from a person I can ask questions too when I don't understand something. But when i would ask questions she wouldn't effectively answer it without making me feel stupid because she would ask me what I think the answer is. It made me not want to ask questions or answer questions. :: Mukhopadhyay is a brilliant researcher.  I sometimes feel however that she doesn't lay a proper foundation in order to fully understand the material.  A lot of the material went over my head--the classes weren't as linear or structured as I would have liked. :: Not very effective at all. I thought I was understanding the material, and then when it came to exams I would fail them, even after studying as much as she said to as well as all the material she said to study. Definitely not a good class. :: not very good. kinda tough to understand and struggles explaining tougher topics in a way all students can learn. Will ask a question and just look at the class until someone provides and answer. In my eyes this is wasted time. Needs to use more examples to help explain the theory better. :: Lecture was difficult to follow she bounced from topic to topic. But overall effective class. Maybe more practice problems or examples would of made the class lecture more effective."
2799,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: It seemed like she was going to, but by the end of the semester everything seemed kind of up in the air and to her disposal. :: yes, however her exams were on the challenging side. :: Yes, work was evaluated based off of what was outlined in the syllabus."
2800,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Dr. Mukhopadhyay is around 5-10 minutes late to class almost every single day. :: yes. :: For the most part. :: Yes, class was started on time and ended on time. :: Yes. :: Class started on time and the instructor used the whole class period."
2801,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She always asks if there are questions. :: I was not motivated in this class because of the instructor. I was excited to take this class but I lost all interest very fast once I realized I couldn't understand any topic because the way she teaches it. I really wish I was able to learn more in the class and understand everything but I wasn't able too even when I studied and tried because it was never enough. :: She would often ask us if we have any questions. :: When I started the course I had a great interest in ceramics due to my job, however, as time went on I found myself hating the material and struggling to understand. I would reread all the notes as well as the textbook as told to do, and still struggled to understand the material. I ended up not enjoying the class as much as I thought I would, and didn't learn as much practical information as I thought I would. While I did learn some, it wasn't until the end of the semester. :: Professor allowed us to do presentations on topics of are choosing that we were interested in. :: Yes however during the exams she was not present. She had only her class proctor their to administer the test. She should be there to answer exam questions."
2802,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Well. :: Responded promptly but was not helpful. When worried about my grade in the class the students in her class were just told to study and that if we didn't know the old stuff we will not understand the new stuff but was unsuccessful in teaching the old stuff in the beginning. :: Well. :: In the class material was hard to grasp. I also visited her office hours a couple of times to gain a better understanding of the material and when I did she was no help. She would simply tell me that if I didn't understand the old material, I wouldn't get the new material. This is understood and makes sense, and was one of the reasons I would go in to talk to her. Also, when I discussed my concerns on failing the course for her, she told me that I had a 'D' in the class which was passing. This is bot encouraging towards students to say as long as you are passing it's okay. In my personal opinion, a professor who thinks like that is not a good professor. They should want their students to succeed and do well, especially if those students are willing to come to them and ask for help. I know from experience that some professors will turn you away when asked for help, but a good teacher should be willing to take the time to help a student that is seeking help. ESPECIALLY if this is during their office hours. :: Professor regularly canceled office hours but did a great job of responding to email. Even on the weekends,. :: Office hours and answered emails to communicate in and out of classroom."
2803,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The class is hard and hard content means you need a very effective instructor.  I do not think the organization of the lectures mattered. :: I was very unclear what chapter we were still on or if we moved on. :: Maybe. :: Yes, everything was organized. :: lectures and course were pretty well organized. :: Lectures were a little unorganized but she followed the course content outline."
2804,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- She canceled her office hours a lot, and was fairly rude when contacted. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: As I mentioned above the times I went to see her or emailed her she responded and met with me, but wasn't much help. :: yes when she didnt cancel them but great with emails. :: Yes the instructor was available during office hours."
2805,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2018 Fall,ME 4730,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: She is very smart and very knowledgeable in the subject but not the best teacher for it. I struggle so much as a student and this was just a class I couldn't follow at all even though I was very interested in the subject. :: Very intelligent professor.  Wish that class was a little more structured, but I understand the material is difficult.  I felt as though classes were bouncing from one topic to the next, and I sometimes had a hard time following along. :: Yes I do have one big one. I had Mukhopadhyay for 2 courses this semester, and she mad EVERYTHING due on the SAME day as well as exams to be on the same day. Both courses of hers that I took were EXTREMELY time demanding in order to grasp the concepts. My word of advice is if you know that you have students in two of your difficult classes, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE EXAMS ON THE SAME DAY. It is extremely stressful for any student whether full or part time, and prevents you from potentially succeeding in both class. Plus, i'm sure it's a lot of work for the professor to grade more than one thing at a time, so it would in the end benefit us both. :: .. :: Overall a good class, learned a lot and was effective."
2806,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- not very. :: Very smart and energetic professor, but his explanations in class are very confusing and cluttered. :: He's not a bad professor. He cares about the students. :: Relatively effective. Sometimes hard to follow exactly what is going on in lecture. :: . :: This instructor is absolutely 100% ineffective.  The only way for him to be more ineffective would be for him to not be present in class. :: Hardly effective. Teaches from powerpoints, but doesn't really go into the thought process of working problems. :: Could be worse but could use some improvements (See additional Comments). :: Not effective at all. Death by PowerPoint. :: Dr. Huang was effective. The topic was challenging due to learning a new coding language. The topics were explained well but the code wasn't as much as I would have wanted. I believe it would have been better if the code was explained step-by-step with an example. :: Dr, Huang has a difficult time relaying information to the student. There is a significant gap between what the student actually know and what Dr. Huang thinks they know. His lecture are ineffective and useless. All his lecture are done in PowerPoint format and have nothing to do with the homework or what is asked on the test. The class throws you into a 40 year old programming language with no instruction. The design problem require the use of Fortran, but his lectures, other than the first one, do no focus on its use. :: Nearly every student I've talked to has struggled with this class. There isn't a textbook associated with the class. Dr. Huang provides PDFs of his own notes, but I think nearly every student would really appreciate a textbook to refer to. The PDFs don't have enough instruction in them to make them as effective as they could be. :: Dr. Huang made this class an experiment for his new power point slides and they are terrible. I will say not enough time was spent on covering how Fortran works. Dr. Huang only used power point slides for the course. Although this enabled him to not require students to aquire a book, He did a much better job teaching from the whiteboard than from the power point slides. I would not say Dr. Huang's students are leaving this class confident in their ability to use Fortran or methods discussed in the course. In short, Dr. Huang's effectiveness was poor. :: This class was very practical and by far the hardest class I have had.  Dr. Huang was effective in his teaching, the content is simple very challenging. :: George Huang knows how to give a good lecture, but requiring students to learn an old programming language as well as the course material conflict many times. :: Very kind person. Very incoherent professor. Generally spent time either showing us pictures his code, which is not clearly commented or defined but rather just several lines of variables, or writing problems on the board with no slides to give more detailed explanations of what it is that he is actually talking about. :: This instructor is incredibly smart, he cannot relate his knowledge to his students. I got more from his powerpoints than from him actually teaching. The only reason to go to class was to figure out how to start/do the impossible projects. Other than that you could learn everything from just reading his powerpoints. :: I believe George means well, but the lecture is not clear. Especially when trying to implement a new coding language (that is terrible for first time users). :: overall effectiveness of the instructor is good. Enjoyed a lot in his class. :: Ultimately, I feel like the instructor was not very effective. While he was excited about the course material, and obviously knowledgeable on its content (each one of the codes we used in class, he wrote himself), this does not necessarily translate to the student learning the material well. In fact, it might actually hurt in some areas. For instance, early on the instructor taught us different iterative methods for computation, with Newton-Raphson method and Secant method being the two major ones. He briefly discussed each, and tried to give an example in his PowerPoint, but the examples often were very complex themselves, with several other variables to consider. Or, the examples were just wrong in their computation (Chapter 6, slide 20).  He understands the content well, but for someone who has never seen these methods in action, it is very difficult to understand how the tools work while simultaneously trying to solve a complex scenario. The professor should isolate one or two example problems that just show how the method works, clearly show the algorithm with each, and how one would code this in the future (and I do not mean copy-pasting snippets of his code on the slide, this is not beneficial, and often times more confusing. Show the class, either by commenting in your code, what each line means, and how it translates to the mathematical formulation).  Furthermore, we never took pen to paper and actually solved a simple problem out by hand to see how these methods actually work. He attempted to list the algorithm associated with each, but it was very confusing to try and follow. The code he provided offered little help, and therein lies another issue: it's very difficult to follow his code and see what he's doing and why he's doing it. As previously mentioned, he wrote all the coding himself, which is very impressive. But when I go out into industry I'm not going to be using his code. I'm going to need to construct my own code, based off of these methods, and I don't feel like simply editing what he did prepared me for that. Now, this is not to say that I feel like, with the current projects, the students should start with a white screen and try to code from the very start. That is simply asking too much of people who, quite honestly, might not have any experience with coding. What I am suggesting, however, is that if he provides explanation for what each line means (or at least the major parts) within the code, as well as instructs the students on different aspects to change that are not related to the course material (such as telling them that temperature needed to be set as an allocatable on project 4), then the students would be more focused on how to apply what they learned rather than struggle, and ultimately go the instructor to ask for help. Finally, and I think this might be the largest problem with the course, the projects are structured in such a way that the student cannot independently tell if their solution is correct. For instance, on project 4, we were asked to graph the analytical and numerically-derived Nusselt number with the Reynold's number. One would think that, by simply looking at this graph, the student would be able to tell if they were right or wrong. However, this is not the case, as there is a very large possibility that the student programmed either incorrectly, and what is being displayed is completely wrong. Unfortunately, there is no way to research this and validate your solution from outside sources, as this problem does not exist anywhere else. So, now it is the responsibility of the student to go speak to the professor and have him check to ensure they are either correct, or incorrect. And this creates a very wrong dynamic, in my opinion. It should be the responsibility of the student to prove they are correct in their answer, through troubleshooting and validation from published values, rather than going to the professor and being solely dependent upon him to ensure they are right. A resolution to this might be to structure the projects so that, at each step, there is some easy way to validate your code is correct. Either by comparing it to values the professor provides in the initial project statement (placing the burden of validation on the student, not the professor), or by outside sources. For instance, in determining the thermal boundary layer, it might be beneficial to list ""experimental"" values (it doesn't have to be from an actual experiment, just values close enough for comparison) for temperature located at a specified height above the plate along the x-direction. This would allow the student to easily check how close they are while still maintaining the very important practice of verification from empirical values."
2807,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: . :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yeah I guess. :: Yes, he laid out every expectation in the syllabus and followed them. :: There was quite a bid on ambiguity between the syllabus and what we were graded on. We were never provided a grading rubric for our design problems, even though I asked for one several times. There is a gab between what Dr. Huang told us to do what the TA graded, especially on the first assignment. :: Yes. :: He was not as clear about what students write down for Midterm problems as I would like. Since the TA grades the projects and (I assume) Dr. Huang grades the Midterm and Final, I have only had one item graded by him. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he followed his syllabus and didn't have any surprises in his class. :: Yes. :: yes, instructor did evaluated the work based as described in the syllabus. :: Yes, the expectations were very clear in the syllabus, and the instructor stuck to them."
2808,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes, sometimes had issues with computer so class started late. :: Yes. :: Usually started on time or within a few minutes of it and remained in class the whole time for the majority of the semester. :: . :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Huang always started class on time and used the entire time. :: Yes, Unfortunately. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes utilized the full class period. :: Yes, the professor was very punctual. There were a few times that technology would fail, or his marker would run dry, but these are to be expected."
2809,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- yes. :: Very encouraging to come to office hours. :: I was not very interested in this course. I did not like fortran. :: Kept students engaged by asking questions and breaking up the flow of the lecture if needed o keep everyone listening. :: . :: He gives impossible projects because he wants to help get us ready for the PE or FE exams. However, this is useless to us because he does not teach us how to build code in fortran. All we do is troubleshoot and while that is effective I wish we were also taught how to write code to solve problems from scratch. :: He tried to tell us how useful the information learned in his class was. :: Showing us what type of problems will be on the PE exam. :: He constantly roasted us on how everything was so easy and he couldn't understand why we weren't understanding FORTRAN. :: He used interesting topics and provided even more interesting projects. He encouraged us to changes values in the projects to learn even more. :: I have no doubt Dr. Huang wants you to learn; however, his ability to relate to the student and communicate the required information is quite poor. If you need help he is willing to help you, but he does not rely the information in a way that makes sense. :: Yes. :: Dr. Huang did not demonstrate interest in my learning. He would show up to class, wait for the TA to set up the projector for him, then use the slides only for the lecture. If there was a project assigned, he would continue to say it is easy to do. No projects were easy, and when I asked for help from the TA, he did not even know what to do. In short, Dr. Huang did not demonstrate any interest in my learning. :: It is apparent that Dr. Huang enjoys teaching and challenging students. :: He seemed very interested in helping us learn and get our questions resolved, he just wasn't very  good in explaining it clearly. :: Yes, he frequently asked for updates on how the lectures were going and showed interest. :: he demonstrated interest in learning by giving class exercise and his presentations. :: Yes, the instructor was very excited and passionate about the course and his students."
2810,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- poorly when following powerpooints. better on the board. :: Neutral. :: He was very helpful to students. However, I felt like I did not know what was going on majority of the time. :: Relatively well. :: . :: communication was good. :: There were a lot of miscommunications during the semester, especially with due dates. :: He was always prompt on answering emails. :: Dr. Huang answered every one of my questions and explained the topics well. As stated earlier, the code for the topics could have been explained a little better. :: He communicated well. He was quick to respond to email. He just was never clear when explaining concepts or questions inside and outside class. :: Never answered emails that I sent, but others had luck with it. :: Dr. Huang did not effectively communicate inside the class because of the power point slides lacking contextual information and his accent. Alone, I can handle bad slides or thick accents; but I can't handle both. :: He communicated well, there is just not enough time to understand all the content. :: Pilot was understandable. :: Deadlines were always clearly stated and he sent emails when they changed. :: he was good at emailing students outside of class and would answer any questions you had. :: Could improve with being more receptive to students. :: very well. :: In the classroom could be confusing at times. This is due to the fact that the PowerPoints were difficult to follow, and anytime he wrote equations on the board he would constantly jump around, or erase terms to add new ones. I want to see a process: how do I get from point A to point Z. I don't want a final answer, which is what I usually ended up writing after erasing and adding to my initial formulation. A better solution might be to print out notes that highlight each step in the process, so the student knows what comes first and what comes after that."
2811,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- decent. :: Not really, the class was always kind of all over the place. :: For the most part, yes. :: Very well organized content. :: . :: No. Not in the slightest. Lectures are all over the place. The course content is nothing more than powerpoints that are overfilled with information that he flies through in class and doesnt explain. He tries to do examples on the board rarely and when he does his hand writing is unreadable. Also, there is no communication between him and the TA for the class so there are constantly different due dates and constant confusion. Nothing is organized and nothing makes sense in this class. :: NO. :: Not really. PowerPoints were lacking in the description field. They were inherently hard to follow based on the information on the slides to see what the thought process is. :: Death by PowerPoint. :: The content and lectures were well organized, I had no trouble in keeping up with the content. :: NO, The content was done in powerpoint. His lecture were my only source of information. I had not book or external information other than his word. I could not work supplemental problems, because i did not have a book. He gave no homework other than design problems, as a result, the only practice for test questions was on the test. Which does not work well. :: Lectures were essentially useless. I'm not sure why there isn't a standard for lectures in which the professors are required to teach by actually doing the content. For a large portion of the class we were basically learning with him pointing at his slides and him asking us about how easy it is. Only until around the midterm and part of the final portion of the class did he start utilizing the whiteboard. Once the whiteboard was utilized the content started to become clear. The general mentality for the class is to pretty much learn the content for the exams outside of class because there wasn't very much to be learned in class. :: NO, after the first couple chapters, most students where lost in what they needed to do for the projects. Eventually, students found it was more useful to just spend a couple days interpreting what he posted on pilot instead of going to class. :: They were well organized. I would have learned in a more effective manner if his slides had annotations in conjunction with the FORTRAN code. :: The balance between fortran and course objectives was not optimal. :: No, no it was not. :: his powerpoints were. :: Yes. :: they were perfectly organised. :: No, lectures and course content were not well-organized. PowerPoints contained random snippets of code, with no clear explanation as to what they are, or where they come from. This marginally works during lecture when he is there to explain it, but the students cannot appreciate it because we are not currently working with the code. When we do, which is well after the lecture, we are left with a code that is just copy-pasted into the PowerPoint. I know what the code looks like, you provided it for me. I want to know why this thing is doing what you say its doing, and how. And I would appreciate it if it all wasn't on one giant slide for me to decipher; this is just as confusing. An alternative would be to have one slide that lists the mathematical formulation, and then the next slide show how that formulation is translated into the code (with the line number included). And the third slide an explanation of why this works.  Another issue is the projects. While they are actually engineering problems that we may come across in the future (which is great, by the way), we don't necessarily do anything worthwhile with them. The basic formulation for each project is as follows: we are given a complicated problem that requires editing of a code he provides. Then, if we are lucky, the professor will tell us how to begin to solve the problem, as it's usually not intuitive by simply looking at his code. Then, the students perform the computation, and generate results that the professor requires. And that's it. There is no way for us to validate our results, no reason why we would want to do this in practice, and no critical analysis that could be made. Of course, this could be done by the student anyway, but then its extra work. A solution to this might be to ask for simple results, and task the student with what they think of them. For instance, in project 1 we were tasked with using either Newton-Raphson method or Secant method to solve. It would have been beneficial for us to run the solution using both codes, and then comment on the effectiveness of each. Why would we want to use Secant method over Newton's (because sometimes it's really difficult taking the derivative), are there any issues with selecting a guess value that is either too close or too far away (sometimes yes, so we should be careful), which one offers faster convergence and does it matter? Furthermore, we could even examine the results we generated, and see what they meant for the overall problem statement. Such as: we could select a pump from a different company that would get us closer to our calculated value and is cheaper, but it has a lower life-cycle so is it worth it? If we were really close to a cheaper pump but are still over-value, could we reduce the needed output somehow? What are sources of error in the system, and how do we mitigate them?"
2812,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- dont know. :: Yes. :: Emailing, yes. Office hours and appointments, I would not know. :: Yes. :: . :: yes. :: His office hours were only offered in the middle of our other thermo track course. We could only go to the TA's office hours. :: N/A. It would be nice if office hours were not held at the exact same time as the other track courses offered for the thermo track. In this course's case the scheduled office hours were during compressible flow which approximately 70% of the class was taking, therefore not many people could go without skipping a very important class. :: Yes. :: I was not able to use his office hours but he was very reasonable on making appointments and was very responsive. :: yes. :: Yes except personally my emails. :: I have never communicated with him because fellow students said he has not responded to their emails or had a bad temper when they met with him outside of class. I guess that is why only one student supposedly met him outside of class. Dr. Huang was NOT reasonably available or responsive to my needs. :: yes very. :: Yes. :: Yes, immensely so. :: somewhat. He had office hours, but they were during a class which over half of the computational methods class also had that semester so hardly anyone was able to do. He complained about no one going, but what do you expect when you have them during a class that over half your class is taking. he would stay after class which was nice, but I didn't feel I was able to communicate well with him to have him help me. :: Yes. :: yupp instructor was always there in his office hours and whenever by appointments. he even replied to the emails instantly. Along with this his TA Austin Tipton is also a great helpful person. Always there to help students. :: Yes, the instructor always reminded his students that he was available, and had a TA for extra assistance."
2813,George Huang,2018 Fall,ME 4010,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: The class uses Fortran, which is extremely outdated and extremely difficult to learn and use in only a semester. Everything in this class could easily be done with MATLAB, which as mechanical engineers we have learned throughout college. Because of Fortran, the class is harder to understand than it needs to be and has a terrible reputation with the students. The instructor (Dr. Huang) tries his best, but he's very hard to understand most of the time because his explanations are so cluttered and most of the students are unfamiliar with the methods he's teaching. His exams are also too difficult and long for the allotted time in class. :: I thought the projects were difficult. I think something else could be used instead of fortran. Also, Austin should not be a TA. I thought he was very rude and not helpful at all. He would complain about helping students. :: None. :: . :: It is time to retire Fortran. It is not taught in this class and there is no class before this one to learn it. Python or Matlab is what should be taught in this class. That is what employers want. I have told business professionals working in the field that we are being taught fortran and all they do is laugh. Huang has no idea how to teach. This class needs to be taught by someone that can relate to students and makes the material clear. This has been the most difficult class I have taken at Wright State and I tell anyone younger than me to avoid the fluids track because of this class.  To sum it up. This class is more difficult than it needs to be and serves no real world purpose. :: This is one of the worst classes I've ever taken. Fortran is absolutely worthless. This class should be focused on a more useful language like Python or advanced Matlab. The problem solving methods could be useful if they were taught better. How are we expected to use Fortran, when we were never taught that language. Not only are we expected to understand the sophisticated solving methods, but we were also expected to just know Fortran. Decrypting the homework assignments was like trying to learn Chinese. I don't feel like I had the resources to succeed in this class. I don't feel like I learned much either. :: Dr. Huang has the ability to be a phenomenal professor but just needs to work in a couple of areas. I think it would be very helpful for Dr. Huang to use the board, or even better the dot camera, to work out the steps of a problem by hand to show the methodology instead of using PowerPoints and just flying through the material. The lectures are great when its on the board, the PowerPoints are just hard to follow. It would also be nice to focus a little less on the Fortran in class. I agree with keeping the projects but they are difficult to do if you don't understand the general concept behind the method used to solve the problem. If we do more examples, by hand, in class I think people would be able to understand the material a lot better. That in turn would help give an understanding of how to solve a problem with the same conceptual method. :: I wish we could have learned a better more useful programming language instead of FORTRAN. :: I would like to thank Dr. Huang for a great semester. :: Dr. Huang is a brilliant man; however, his ability to relate to the student in a way that makes sense is poor.  He does not rely the information to the student in a way that makes sense.  He gives tests that are unrealistic in the time period given.  He does not admit his mistakes, and when you ask about them, he can get very defensive and confrontational. He is not willing to learn a new programming language, as a result, i am learning a 40+ year old programming language that is not even in use anymore.  I feel as though this class would be much more useful if it was taught in python or MatLab, or replaced with a Fluent Class. Dr. Huang recognizes that students have complained about this class every year (he mentions it in class on the time), but refuses to change anything.  Dr. Huang and his TA did not communicate very well about what was expected from us in the Design Problems. :: I don't understand why we're required to learn a coding language along with numerical methods we've never used in one class. If we are required to use FORTRAN, then a class on FORTRAN should be required. Providing use the code and telling us to make adjustments with half the time we don't understand what's going on in like a quarter of the code isn't acceptable. The class is pretty much a requirement for thermal-fluids that won't be utilized by students. :: When I tell my coworkers, peers, and friends that teach engineering at local institutes of technology/colleges; they LAUGH at the fact I am learning Fortran. They say I should instead learn PYTHON because I can do more things with it than Fortran. The four projects he assigned the undergraduates did not have any comments. Students had to spend time going through every line to figure out how everything worked and fix any problems with his code. I would rather have smaller home work assignments that break down these large projects to allow students to focus on different code functions. This way, when they see it in his code for projects, they will know what it does. The last lecture involved the TA making multiple mistakes, The professor jumping in with faded markers and interrupting the TA. This resulted in the TA mouthing things behind the Professor's back (i.e. when Dr. Huang said the Wolfram code he made was easy to understand, Austin Tipton mouthed the words ""No it's not""). I paid for this class out of my own pocket, and I am very unhappy with the content Dr. Huang delivered, how he delivered it, how the TA interacted with students, how the TA didn't know how to do the problems, and how even Dr. Huang showed up with a half-tucked shirt and bedraggled appearance. I now must pass this class because it is not offered next semester if I want to complete the Fluids track. :: Please do not think that this is easy for your students. In fact, general consensus was that this course was very hard. The problem stems from sitting down and figuring everything out by yourself and not the in class time. :: Nope. :: He is a very kind man, and a very concerned professor. He is just not really clear at what he is talking about when we just try to follow his scratch ups on the board, and he's not very clear at explaining how things work. It would help immensely if he added slides with fundamental concepts defined in written vocabulary, showed an example from the book instead of his head, and put comments in his code that explain what each step is doing. Character: 8 out of 10 Teaching ability: 2 out of 10. :: This dumb class had us use fortran which is an ancient coding language that my dad learned in college decades ago. It has no relevance in the modern day world. So not only did we have to learn hard math and concepts for this class (which is fine because its a 4000 level engineering class so I expected it), but we also had to learn a useless coding language to implement them which no one had even seen before and that no other college teaches, that we'll probably never use again. This professor is either too lazy or doesn't want to be bothered to learn another language like matlab or python. Which are relevant and used by others AND the university already had both at their finger tips to use. No instead he had to go with this old dinosaur ass language which is ""FREE"" he said even thou wright state PAID for it and we had to switch access codes and log in thro a VPN in order to acccess it. When the server was working. There have been multiple issues with getting fortran downloaded and working for the students in class. The professor also said multiple times that it didn't matter that he wasn't using a modern language because it was easy to transfer the theory and code into matlab or python or another language. If is was sooo dammm easy then why didn't he do it and just the teach the class in the 21st century like a professor who cares and not a research professor. Like damn, it shouldn't be that hard. If he is so smart then it shouldn't take him long to learn matlab or python and transfer his files over to it. Especially with how long he has been here and how long matlab has been out for. This class seriously needs to get revamped. Fortran needs to be gotten rid of because it is a useless skill out in the field. He needs to do more actual examples and not just read from a powerpoint and say its easy and that you just have to do it. For the final exam review session a grand total of 30% of what was going to be on the exam was covered and then 2 additional topics were said. It was the most useless and stupid review session I have ever had. I don't know if its his fault or the TAs fault. I know the TA feels bad about what happened, but the professor should have been able to jump in and take over the review session so his students didn't leave the review session asking each other whats the exam over and what the f*($ was that. I'm happy Ill pass this class because god have mercy on your soul if you have to go through this class more than once. :: Very difficult to learn a lot of new and difficult information while also learning a new coding language. Not a fan of the language either. Slow processing, very picky, and not clear. :: All good. :: If nothing else, my two main comments are: 1.) if you are going to continue using FORTRAN (which I do not recommend, as it did not have the desired output), then please provide content similar to this (https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/SIMULATION/FLUENT+Learning+Modules) where you record yourself building your code to help the students understand where each piece is coming from, and 2.) if you are going to utilize CFD in your course, use a dedicated commercial or open-source CFD solver (https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Codes#Commercial_codes). The end goal is to prepare students for what they might experience in the workplace, and to give them valuable experience that they can use and comment on in their resume. As to the first, the instructor's goal was to have the student struggle and eventually conquer a coding platform that not a lot of people are familiar with. This would mean that the student would need to develop good troubleshooting skills, and learn how to diagnose problems in the code. While I personally think this is great, this never happened. The coding provided was oftentimes too complicated to adequately diagnose, and most students simply had to ask for help on what to do, rather than figuring it out for themselves. There were a few bright students that didn't need to do this, but a majority of the students really struggled with no educational payoff. The complicated subroutines made it worse, as students who are more familiar with a linear approach had to try and jump around to see where the code wasn't working. When a failure did occur, it was very difficult to debug, as the text output really didn't help too much. Finally, even if a solution was reached, the student had to use a separate program to plot and check the results. This is not only clunky, but frustrating when other computational solvers allow graphical results to be generated immediately.  The second, I think is self-explanatory: saying that ""I have coding experience using a CFD solver and can easily manipulate it"" is a lot better compared to, ""I edited a CFD code in FORTRAN, that modeled a very basic fluid problem"". Furthermore, while coding did help me understand the pieces and parts available in the ""black box"" of CFD, I'm an engineer that needs to use the ""black box"", not make a new one. The code that is provided for CFD can only be used for a flat plate, and the mesh is impossible to"

B is really encouraging and only wants to see good come out of you. :: hes brilliant. :: Very effective, excellent professor. :: The course was wonderful and had amazing content. :: very. :: Very energetic and informative. :: Does a great job explaining, maybe goes just a little too fast. :: Very effective, goes through topics fast, but devotes time in class to help students. :: Very effective. :: Best of the best. :: Amazing. :: Good but moves at a quick pace. :: Great but definitely needs to look at what he's providing for the homework because it felt sometimes that not enough info was given. He should also provide PowerPoints to demonstrate material outside of class. :: very knowledgeable about the subject and does a great job of presenting the information. :: Very knowledgeable about the subject. Unfortunately he kind of sped through material. Maybe did one or two examples and expected the student to understand and memorize the content. This class was probably geared towards people with previous CAD experience. For others like myself it was playing catch up. :: pretty good. :: He is a great professor that explains the material covered very well. He does the assignments with you and allows you to follow along with what he does. He is also very patient and understanding, even when you can't get something to work and it's the seventh time in the same day that you asked him for help. All around great professor. :: Dr. B, is a fantastic and energetic professor who makes lessons fun and easy. :: Very effective. Very patient and willing to work through problems multiple times to make sure everyone understood and saw the steps to complete a model/problem"

However, the grading system was talked about and upheld in the over all grading process. :: Yes"
2816,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Class was always started on time and used all of class time for question or class work. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, and any time that was left after what he demonstrated was time to work on homework. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Mostly. :: Yes, some classes ended 'early' but that was because I did the HW outside of class and the time was used for students to use it to ask questions and complete the HW. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. lectures did not usually last the whole class but encouraged students to stay and work on homework in class so that he could help if they had questions. :: Yes. :: pretty good. :: Yes, the instructor always started class on time and would lecture for the first part of the class and then would allow you to stay and work on homework for the second part. He stayed the whole time to help students with questions but many students left after the lecture. I personally found this help time on homework extremely useful and always stayed. :: Class always started on time and the full class period was available for questions and one on one help. The instruction did not take up the full class period. :: Yes"
2817,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By making sure you pat attention to the little things. :: yes. :: By checking students' learning in class and helping students when they could not grasp a subject. :: He would personally walk around and help as many people as possible. :: he seemed to enjoy teaching the class and the topics covered, and providing lots of class time for us to ask questions about homework. :: He would answer any and all questions someone had, and would take time to talk to students about things relating to class, or real would applications. :: By giving us lots of in class and outside help and resources. :: Made his and TA's office hours clear, very enthusiastic in class, helped students struggling during lecture. :: He constantly asks if we need help. :: Yes. :: He answered questions throughout the class to make sure everyone was keeping up. :: N/a. :: lots of classtime devoted to him walking around giving one on one help to students who were confused. :: Available for help in class. :: pretty good. :: Yes, the instructor was constantly answering questions and helping us with the subject matter. He also brought up several other topics related to, but not apart of the class that we might find  interesting to look into or attend. He also gave us future advice and was always willing to answer questions about co-ops and some of the things we could experience later in college. :: He offered his assistance on all homework and answered all questions thoroughly."
2818,Craig Baudendistel,2018 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Had no problem answering question weather it was in class or though email. :: yes. :: Very well. :: Very well. :: very. :: Very effectively. Nothing came as a surprise. :: Very well. :: Very effectively, any unusual change in course schedule was made clear reasonably in advance. :: Pretty effectively. :: Very well. :: very well, he just moves too fast sometimes and half the class will be having problems and then we end up having to back all the way up. If he just slowed down a bit, everyone would be together and we wouldn't have to keep stopping all the time. :: N/a. :: good communication and clear deadlines. :: Very well. :: pretty good. :: The instructor sent out several emails and was constantly posting things on Pilot. He also made it clear when assignments were due in class and what was expected of us.

Everything we learned seemed to build off of each other. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, I liked the structure of the class (learning a new tool every lecture/week). It got a little work heavy during the chair project, with chair stuff and regular homework. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Course content and lectures were organized. Maybe make PowerPoints for lectures so students have something to fall back on if theyre stuck on homework and didn't completely grasp the concept in class. :: pretty good. :: Yes, the course was logically organized and so were the lectures. His classes were also logically organized as for the first half of the class he walked us though a demonstration of the next concept we were learning and then we were given the rest of class to work on homework. When the homework deals with running a program on the computer, I found this time very useful. :: Yes, the content was very easy to follow and stuck to a very specific scheduled which made the class very smooth. :: Very well organized. He had a plan and stuck to it and everything worked extremely well."

Katie was not helpful with questions, and she would sit at the computer and try all of the same things I had already tried before telling me she didn't know how to help. It felt like she was another student in the class with how helpful she was. :: Great teacher, would definitely recommend his class. :: Good professor overall.  Polite, organized and cares about his students. :: Solid class. :: Loved the course, sad I don't have you for ME 1020. :: Please slow down. :: Nope. :: pretty good. :: All around great instructor, explains things well and is very easy to understand and listen to. He also brings enthusiasm and energy to the classroom. He is probably my favorite professor this semester."
2822,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- His method of ""teaching"" is showing a few key elements in the beginning of lecture for a topic, and then having the class try and figure out the problem by themselves for the remainder of the class. He does not teach. You teach yourself for the course. It's like showing a kid how to ride a bike, then putting him on a Harley Davidson in the middle of the highway. That's how this professor teaches. :: Fair effectiveness. Seemed able to answer questions, but read notes straight from his notes as if he hadn't seen the material before. :: He followed the book and provided/explained examples from the text, which I found to be very effective. :: ugh. :: Good. :: On a scale from 0 to 5, this instructor receives a 2.5. :: exams were completely different from class work. :: some how effective. He should try to explain more clearer and precise. :: Good explanation of the material, always there to help, good feedback that helps to improve the studying,  alot of examples given and explained. :: The instructor does well. Does best to explain all concepts clearly and go back when something makes sense. Is willing to stay on topic if something is not understood, but doesn't linger too long. The only item that I felt was non-value added was the group projects. They do well in other classes, but in this one it just seemed to take up valuable time. :: 8/10"
2823,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Of the two exams so far, what was on the test was not covered in the class. He would routinely run out of time before the exam, because this is the summer semester and class is much more cramped, and instead of adjusting the exam to cover what was taught, he would put on the exam questions that were barely shown. :: yes. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus. :: ugh. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Everything has been done by the books. :: Yes. :: Yes. Very clear about expectations and following through with those described. :: 8/10"
2824,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- This is the one thing I can actually give him credit for; he was punctual. However, efficient use of the time in class was not something he was good at. :: on time or within 1-2 minutes late. Used full class period unless an example would run over class period. :: ugh. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: arrived later as the summer went on. :: Always on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: 9/10"
2825,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He's slowly killing it and making me wish to be homeless for the rest of my life. I did not come to college to teach myself something. I came to college to learn and grow and develop my skills. :: Always available to answer questions, seemed passionate about topic. :: Yes. The instructor was enthusiastic about the classes understanding of the subject material. :: ugh. :: His caring eyes. :: He gave us extra and optional assignments to help us progress our learning. :: wanted us to communicate during class. :: Group Projects. Inducing the fear of future classes to come. :: Helpful and always points out examples from text or solutions to review in case of mistakes on assignments. :: Going over examples not directly from the book was a plus. :: 7/10"
2826,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- His grading was atrocious. There were less than ten people in the class for both exams, and it took him more than two weeks to finish grading exams that had only three questions on them each. He would always give non-committal reasons and back out of the questionings for our grades. :: used email and was responsive. :: I never attended office hours, so I can't attest to outside of the classroom, but he communicated effectively in the classroom. :: dgfh. :: Well. :: In the classroom, his communication was decent. I did not meet with him outside of the classroom. :: good. :: emails. emails. emails. :: A great communication in and out the class,. :: The accent aside, I understood him clearly and was able to communicate ideas well. :: 8/10"
2827,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- They were not. The few times he actually did provide lecture on problems he would get confused midway through because he missed a step or did something that was outright wrong. I am not even sure if he knows the subject himself or if he is just learning along the way as we are. :: yes. :: Yes, they followed the book, chapter by chapter. :: dgfh. :: Yes. :: Organized enough for the class to progress, but there are occasions when the pacing was too fast. :: somewhat - exams were fairly different from homework and class work. :: Some classes needed to be extended because we did not have enough time to go over some Chapter examples but everything else stayed on track with the syllabus. :: Yes, specially the group work was encouraged in this course, learn about others point of views and work together to solve, if there is any mistakes its a great motivation to review it with classmates and learn from it. :: Yes. We followed a path and the examples on handouts were ordered in the expected path which made it easy to follow in the book. :: 9/10"
2828,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- The few times I needed to speak with him, he was accommodating and stayed after class, which ends at 10 at night. So yes. :: yes. :: I never had to visit his office hours, make an appointment of email him. Although, he did email changes in homework assignments whenever they changed, so students were made aware and had ample time to prepare. :: ugh. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Always at his office during his offices hours. :: Yes , always there in and after class and communicate with emails about coming up material updates. :: Responded to emails. Never used office hours myself. :: no interactions occured"
2829,Amir Farajian,2016 Summer,ME 2120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Please provide instructors who can actually teach the material that they are assigned. Please. Of this, I beg of thee. :: None. :: ugh. :: No. :: I would prefer it if we could keep our past exams. :: no. :: Take your time to explain, it helps a lot to have a clear picture of what is going on so the student feels a bit more confident when tackling the problem alone. :: Overall good instructor. My only complaints go back to the group project. While they help the grade, they did not help in understanding the concepts."
2830,Maher Amer,2016 Summer,ME 2210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- before the instructor broke his arm i felt like the class was well taught and understandable. after the teacher broke his arm, examples and lectures were then done by power point which made it harder to understand the material, because the examples were not being written out by hand, they were just text book solutions. :: excellent. :: The instructor is very effective. He keeps lectures interesting and does many problems in class that demonstrate the concepts being taught. :: Not really effective. Made sure we knew concepts. Couldn't do example's on board because he broke his arm. :: Very effective. Taught the material in a very organized and well manner. :: Dr. Amer is skilled at presenting the information in a clear and concise way, and does a good job of focusing on the important steps and avoiding over-complicating it. :: Professor Amer is definitely one of the better professors I have had over the course of my college career. He presents the material in a way that is not too rushed and is easy to understand. Very respectful. :: Perfect. :: Good. :: Very effective and made the concepts easier. :: a. :: Good instructor.

2833,Maher Amer,2016 Summer,ME 2210,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he didnt really. he provided examples in class that did not match any of the homework. the only thing the lectures contributed to was the online quizes that he gave. :: excellent. :: He didnt. JuSt wanted to be our friend. :: He taught us to think like engineers and gave real-work examples. :: He would take questions seriously and would take the time to emphasize important topics. :: He always asked for questions from the class frequently throughout each period and stressed the importance of homework and quiz problems. :: Good. :: very easily. :: he did a good job referring to a real life applications that given in the problems encountered in class. :: a. :: Just. :: good

He was always around to help and he cared very much about each of his students. He wanted everyone to succeed. :: He communicated well. :: Very effectively. :: Same. :: very effective. :: the communication was extremely poor. if you didn't understand a point he will disrespect you in the office hours and make fun of you. :: a. :: very well. responded quickly to emails. :: N/a. :: Very effective. :: good. :: Not effectively, homework submission areas on Pilot were often unavailable without explanation and coverage of exams was not communicated."
2835,Maher Amer,2016 Summer,ME 2210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- no. :: yes. :: Course lectures were organized well. :: Nope. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. The material was covered in a manner that never felt rushed and each topic covered led into the next in a way that was reasonable. :: Yes. :: yes. :: overall yes. :: a. :: yes. :: Kind of. :: Yes. :: good. :: No, lectures skipped around the content without taking much of a logical path"

2837,Maher Amer,2016 Summer,ME 2210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- the instructor should have had a ta or a substitute come in to handwork some examples instead of just reading them of of a lecture slide. :: no. :: No. :: Nope. :: One of the best teachers I have had in the college. Friendly, nice at times, but he can get serious when he needs to. He pushes people to try, which is a good quality. Very caring of his students and it shows it. He is willing to go above and beyond it help his students succeed. :: No. :: i respect this professor for what he is doing to his students, my advice for him is to be a little bit more easy going on the office hours. another big advice, while solving a problem, please write the question on the board and what to find so if the student went back home and started studying the materials he will have an idea of what is this problem is asking for and how to solve. :: a. :: No. :: good. :: Yes, pilot is forcing me to fill out this survey before I can access any of my classes.  Therefore, here is my survey!. :: The instructor came across a lot of the time with a very hostile attitude, making me feel threatened when the class was in session. The class was actually angrily threatened with legal action on one occasion due to one student's use of an electronic device. On another occasion, a wrong solution was intentionally provided for a homework problem with the intention to ""trick"" students when this problem was again presented on the exam.

2875,Joseph Slater,2016 Summer,ME 7120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes, but it was hard to see where the homework and the exams and the projects really intersected. :: The notes were ahead of the work, but that was a lot due to the class not having questions. :: Content on first exam was covered during lectures and projects that took place after the exam, although due to expedited summer schedule there isn't much that could be done about this without eliminating one of the exams."
2876,Joseph Slater,2016 Summer,ME 7120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes, Prof. Slater answered emails often and quickly.  He could intuit problems that were presented to him with appropriate information. :: Yes.  Professor was always able to meet or email when needed and as much as needed. :: Very quick to respond to emails and willing to meet after hours to accommodate work schedule."
2877,Joseph Slater,2016 Summer,ME 7120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Not really. More hand-waving and examples would be preferred in class. The .pdf notes were just OK. It's hard to get engaged with copy-paste lecture notes. :: Overall very great professor.  Was able to learn a lot from this professor."
2878,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Summer,ME 4250,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He covers all topics in textbook with problems explained in matlab programs effectively. all over explanation is good and clear. :: Good at providing the material for coding.  But the explanation of the subject is not receivable by student like us, because of the way of lecture he delivers is not understandable. :: ok, the professor explains the materials ok, the material is hard so i dont think he can does better job than what he did. :: good. :: He put together good slideshows that were straight out of the book. Didn't have any original material of his own. Also if you don't know how to do Matlab which is the most pointless program ever you are screwed for this class. He doesn't teach at all just goes over examples and has you copy down code. Only 1/4 of the class ever showed up to his lectures. Yells at students when they are struggling with a problem. Bad professor, I didn't learn anything from this class. Am very disappointed that he is teaching machining this fall because I do not want to take him again. How do people like this get their PhD's, cuz he is a horrible teacher. Also I don't know how Wright State considers  any of these courses graduate level courses. I am an undergrad and the whole concept of grad school is bull shit. The work load between undergrad and grad students doesn't differ at all for any of the classes I've been in. Shouldn't grad students have more homework problems, or tougher problems on the exams. There is no difference between the homework or exams at all for any class that is. What a joke. :: The professor is good. :: goody. :: good. :: Good. :: The instructor is not good, the students can not understand any explanation from him.  The grades were not given for the students.  When the students ask for the grades he said "" talk to the TA"" even though the TA did not response to the emails were sent to him.  I did not get any of my grades exams, homework, and in classes.  His english is not clear for the students.  He lacks of communication as a professor in the US. :: good. :: good. :: instructor was good enough to deliver the lectures effectively with practical problems associated with it. :: Excellent. :: Yes. :: Excellent. :: very effective. :: He is okay"

I will not recommend him as a teacher for any class. :: nothing interesting and his exams was hard. :: just good. :: instructor was able to create interest by correlating the theoretical  and practical approch. :: Yes. :: Good. :: His in class work inspired me to learn more into the subject. :: group tasks. :: partially
2882,Junghsen Lieh,2016 Summer,ME 4250,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He makes people talk and cares each and every person individually and clears his or her doubts. :: Outside of classroom, he don't talk with us.  Even we mailed for the programs (reference), he doesn't reply. In class, he will make us to write the programs of the subject related. :: good. :: not bad. :: Good. :: very good. :: GOOD. :: Good. :: He is really bad in communication, his english is very bad.  he barely can be understandable. :: he doesn't like anyone to talk to him about something he said it even if it was not clear he is not clear about what he wants from us also it is July 24 and i still don't know what's my grade in the in class work and homework. i asked the Dr he said email the TA and that was in the first couple weeks i also told the dr that i didn't get my grades yet and he said i will tell the TA to give you and i still didn't get anything. :: good. :: he was able to communicate with each and every student ion and out of the class. :: Yes. :: Very effective. :: Good. :: quite effective. :: He has to create pilot and provide any information releted to subject and class. It is hard for any student to communicate outside the class. all i mean to say is, Pilot should be utilized for the convenience of students to get access for materials and other stuff"

2886,Akm Mian,2016 Summer,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- very good. :: Very good instructor, lots of examples, clear definition of theory, and real world use of material. :: good. :: Great. :: bad. :: Very good. :: I feel as though he did a good job in grading and his overall fairness. However, I feel as though I learned next to nothing from this course. All of the material and examples were explained on a high level bird's eye view that gave very little context or detail into how to actually solve the problem or what the purpose of the problem even was. The course also utilized Matlab, and more specifically, Simulink for many different problems. A brief tutorial on Simulink was given near the start of the semester, but very little of the process or problem solving paths for it was explained. Generally, each problem would have some aspect to it that we had never seen before and did not know how to do. This would then be explained later when we asked, but that didn't do anything for the problem we missed because of lack of prior knowledge. I, and I believe most of my peers, routinely felt that we had either, not been taught or hadn't been adequately taught, much of the material that was presented on the quizzes and especially the homework. This defeats the purpose of both the homework and quizzes. The homework and quizzes should be used as practice to refine skills learned in class. Instead, we regularly were unable to do large portions of the homework. Office hours were available, and I understand that if help is needed the student is expected to come to the professor for help, but as an engineering student working a full time job, I do not have extra time to invest in trying to go into office hours every single week. Hundreds and thousands of students spend thousands of dollars each semester for the service of learning, and yet it seems to be expected that those students should be responsible to teach themselves the material with the vague guidance of the professor. This is not the correct method. We, as students, have paid for a service. That service is then frequently sloppily thrown at us. If a half made, luke-warm, $4,000 burger was dropped on your tray at McDonald's wouldn't you be somewhat annoyed. Much of that last paragraph doesn't entirely pertain to the instructor of this course. To be clear, I felt that he was fair and honest with us. I do not feel as though I learned much, but I have had much worse professors. Most of the last paragraph pertains to Wright State as a whole. I believe that changes need to be made by the University to encourage better, more worthwhile instruction and course content. I have very rarely felt that the education I have received has been worth the tuition that I have paid. :: Poor ability to relay knowledge. Does not know the material enough to be teaching it. :: Overall effectiveness was good. Described difficult topics in a way I could understand. Maybe could of done a bit more examples involving some topics and simulink and matlab. :: Being that he was new to teaching the class, I would say he taught well but still needs to improve for future semesters of system dynamics. :: 100%, the professor aimed to explain the course really well. :: Great. :: . :: Good. :: the instructor is really perfect in teaching. :: Excellent. :: He is a good teacher. He really cares about his students and he tries really hard to make the information make sense. :: he did his best to teach the material, he is a really nice guy and is always in his office to help. :: Not too bad, but can improve his teaching skills and try to control the class. :: he was the best. :: great. :: Very helpfull. :: good instructor, covers almost the whole ideas of the subject. :: Very effective. :: Not bad. :: Excellent. :: He is a decent lecturer. I like that he focuses on example problems. I do not like when he already has them written down ahead of time though. It is much better if he writes down the example and talks through them simultaneously. I also find his accent makes him difficult to understand sometimes, but that isn't his fault. :: I think writing it out of the board is a lot more helpful than a projector or power point slides. I had a decent understanding from Professor Mian's current teaching method. :: One of the best professors in wright state. :: Very effective. :: Very good. :: he tries hard for the students to understand the material. :: Very good. :: He has some issues withe delivering things, which sometimes brings some confusions. :: Øµ. :: Good. :: Wasn't bad. :: Very good. :: good. :: he is so helpful and friendly. :: He was Great, cares about his students. :: Lecture time was not useful. :: asdf. :: This instructor was highly ineffective in presenting the material.  The was a severe lack of organization in his presentations which made the material difficult to understand and tested the patience of the class.  The material was not presented in a cohesive manner and without a global perspective."

He is super useful professor and available to answer all relative questions. he has excellent technical skills. :: mild. :: Vet effective. :: Dr. Young did a good job at outlining our responsibilities in the lab and was also available for questions that we had regarding these labs and the write up. One suggestion is a way to make students upload data possibly one week prior to lab due dates when using class data sets. towards the end of the semester some students would place data increasing closer to the due date for each. :: I liked how students had the freedom to come in and complete labs(except the few that professor/TA had to be present for safety reason)  at their own time I thought that gave students some freedom and responsibility. :: good. :: ok. :: Did a great job of explaining what we were doing and why we were doing it as well as how it relates to work we may perform in the real world.

That being said, I do not think that it went that well. There was inaccurate data within every lab and all of the students would have to use it because we were assigned specific tests to run to comprise the WHOLE lab. Keeping this lab to partners seems ideal, but to just make more tasks and check ins to hold each student accountable for what they did. At the end of the lab reports make a section that each student needs to write that is a whole paragraph of what they did.

2920,James Menart,2016 Summer,ME 7330,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he used the full class period and he usually comes to class before 15 minutes to prepare all things for the lecture. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. In fact he comes 15 minutes early and arranged everything before all students come to class. :: Yes. :: for sure. :: GOOD. :: started before time most days and usually ended on time. got off topic and sidetracked on multiple occasions. 9/10. :: He does. sometime he went over the time to complete a topic, and that is very effective. :: yes. :: Yes, Very well. :: yes. :: All the classes were started and ended on time. :: He is very punctual. He will come 15 minutes earlier,so that he can utilize the class time perfectly. :: Yes.Perfect Timing. :: yes. :: Yes. He is quite punctual and utilizes every given second. :: Yes. :: Yes , Sir was always before time and made necessary preparation required for the class , so that full time of class is utilized. :: Yes class used to start on time and full class period was used.

2921,James Menart,2016 Summer,ME 7330,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- medium. :: engaged the class with multiple group ""mini"" projects that served as extra credit in the course. :: He so good at teaching and explained very well from base concepts. :: he gives a lot of interest to my learning he explain any question and spend much time for that. :: very good. :: Nice. :: By connecting the subjects from under grad to grad. :: By keeping the bonus in the class. It really helped me in learning the subject with interest. :: yes. :: OK. :: meh 6/10. :: He tried to focus on the some topics we need to review. :: very good at his part. :: absolutely yes I strongly agree. :: the instructor was able to develop interest by relating theoretical approach with practical. :: Posting the classes online in pilot so that everyone who could not attend the class can listen to them later. :: He organised some in class quizzes, which created a lot of interest in me. :: His way of explaining made subject more interesting. :: bonus inclass tasks. :: He literally does spoon feeding and gets each and every point into clear picture. :: He teaches each and every single point, doesn't miss anything. :: Instructor showed great interest in my learning by asking frequent questions and addressing the answer well enough to make me understand. :: He used to ask questions in class and used to explain topics well and used to clear doubts. Instructor has provided walking hours also to understand topics again if I have doubt in that. :: gives  a sense of the field, its past, present, and future directions, the origins of ideas and concepts. :: very well. :: He used to tell lot of examples whenever we have problem regarding understanding something and he always shows everything by using blackboard collaboration software"
2922,James Menart,2016 Summer,ME 7330,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: Very effectively, through the use of office hours, email and pilot. :: He is responsive to all the queries in and out of classroom. :: yes every time when i send email he directly answer about my email. :: very effective. :: Good. :: very good. :: He gives time to every student both in the class and out of the classroom. :: Very well. :: very well. :: OK. :: 8/10. :: He did that efficiently as I try that. :: Extremely well. :: very excellent. :: instructor was able to communicate and help both in and out of the classromm. :: I would rate it 4.5 on scale of 5. :: He cleared all my doubt both in and out of the class. :: Very nice. :: quite effective. :: He is always with the smiling attitude and friendly outside. :: Instructor was good when it comes to communicating with students both in and out class.

2925,James Menart,2016 Summer,ME 7330,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: I love recorded lectures. love them. such a simple things makes a tremendous difference in the ability to go back and revisit topics to prepare for exams and complete assignments. Wish more professors utilized such resources. :: No. :: he was the best who gave me understanding about the Convective Heat and Mass Transfer. :: no. :: No. :: no. :: NO. :: 52.34/70 + 5pt curve  Total 57.34/70  Final Grade B. :: I highly appreciate this instructor. He is one of the most favorite faculty I have ever seen.  simply, he is wonderful. :: No. :: Dr. Menart is well-known and I notice all the students love him. :: no. :: No Comments. Its a good course with a good professor. :: Best professor so far. :: No comments on professor. :: NO. :: He is a big asset to WSU. :: We need more professors like him.  And please add Lab and some practical teaching not everything in theory. That is why we came to USA for masters.  Apart from the professor, I am extremely disappointed coming to Wright State Univ!. :: I want to thank sir for increasing my knowledge and interest in this particular subject. :: Overall  the teaching of instructor was great and has helped me to enhance my knowledge in field of Convective Heat  transfer. :: I would be very much happy to take other course of Jim sir he is so good"
2926,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was unclear on most aspects of the taught lessons of each day. There was virtually no instruction on the term paper. Any asked questions were answered with unsatisfactory or vague responses. The TA was very unfair with grading homework assignments. :: Good. :: Excellent in subject. Satisfactory in delivery. :: the instructor was good enough to teach the concepts along with the practical examples. :: was good but he need to focus more on fundamental topics so that students can understand more easily. :: The professor was at first very motivating and was able to return papers in a good time frame. After two weeks it was clear that our professor struggles with teaching. Throughout this course there was very limited feedback from him and very little resources given to complete homework. In some cases we never even got our homework back, so studying for exams was very challenging. Two weeks into the course the professor deemed the book ""wordy"" and quit using it. In some cases his power-points actually contradicted what was in the book, making it very hard to understand. This teacher was also very unprofessional. The day he handed back our exams ( 1 and 2) he had each of us one by one go up in front of the class and spoke to each of us about how we did. Not only was this embarrassing it wasted half of the class period, time that could have been used to help us understand the material better. He also managed to display our grades for homework 1-4 and the lab to everyone for 20 minuets because he was distracted. There was obvious tension between the professor and his aid Richard. This also lead to some very uncomfortable moments in the classroom. Often times Richard wouldn't do what the professor said and it would take 10-15 minuets for class to get started because of it. Dr. Menard realized there was a problem and was able to fix most of the issues with this course for about 1 day until Dr. Sritharan returned to his normal ways of teaching. When it came to pilot, he rarely knew how to use it and rarely uploaded anything. So if you lost a homework handout you were out of luck because it wouldn't be online and it could take up to 3 weeks to get him to reply to an email. The power-points used in class were distracting and didn't help me understand the material whatsoever. In general Dr. Sritharan was very ineffective in teaching the materiel and took what was thought to be a rather straight forward course and turned it into a nightmare. As a student from another college interested in wright state for grad school (renewable energy program), his performance will make this the first and last course I take at Wright State University."
2927,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- I guess. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Altogether, grading when it was done was random. The course syllabus said nothing about this being a excel based course. If you didn't turn in an assignment with an excel spread sheet your work would be looked at as lesser and you could expect to receive around half credit for the problem."
2928,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- It was annoying and inappropriate to go overtime. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Typically the class started 5-10 minutes late. As I said earlier the aid would often not do as the professor instructed which would cause class to be at a stalemate.
2929,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- I was not that interested. :: good. :: Good. :: instructor was able to create interest by relating practical approach and theoretical approach. :: not so good.
2930,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Terribly. I would email either the professor or the TA and both would either never respond, or respond weeks later. :: good. :: He was effective. :: he was able to communicate in and out of the class by arranging help sessions. :: was good. :: Overall, there was a pathetic level of communication between the professor and students. The pilot was essentially useless because the professor would forget to upload assignments. For example, exam 2 was over homeworks 5-8 none of witch had been returned. Seeing this problem, the professor said hed post the solutions so we could study them. Well he forgot to post them until a few hours before the exam. I sent emails with no response, I have yet to ever get a response from him."
2931,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not very well. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. Towards the end of the course I found us spending time reviewing material from week 3 that most of us as a class had failed. (I know most people failed homework relating to this material because he showed us everyone's grades).
2932,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Definitely NOT! Professors and TAs should RESPOND to emails to the best of their ability. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: i never did.so i dont know. :: Not at all. He gave us no information about where or how to contact him outside the classroom. And as i stated earlier he never replied to my emails."
2933,Subramania Sritharan,2016 Summer,ME 4520,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The TA was by all means NOT a fair grader whatsoever. The TA should not award or deduct points based on what they feel they deserve, but on the student's performance on the vague assignments. :: no. :: No. :: no. :: no"
2934,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was very effective.  Whenever he taught a new topic, he would do examples for us to follow along.  He also helped us on our assignments. :: it was so good. :: Great instructor, always will to help with anything I didn't understand. :: Very nice and always willing to help. :: Better as the semester continued, but still has found an effective way to teach this particular subject. :: The instructor is mostly effective in teaching the subject. However, I think that more guided examples in class would be very beneficial. :: Instructor does alright. I understand that he hasn't been teaching the topic for very long, but the current method isn't very effective for me. :: very helpful and is able to answer any questions. :: Very effective. :: Okay!!. :: Very helping. :: great and handy. :: bad. :: Scott is good instructor but his plan about the grades  not helping the students!. :: great. :: good. :: No. :: not bad. :: Scott is a great teacher. :: He is always trying to explain the material, and make his students good at matlab. :: he is good. :: Normal. :: good. :: i taught in a way that made me understand the concept at hand. :: good. :: The instructor's effectiveness was overall pretty well in terms of teaching the course material. :: it was very useful. :: The effectiveness was fairly good. Each class, we knew what we were going to learn and that we could come to him with any and all questions and he would gladly answer them. Definitely one of the nicest teachers on campus. The only thing that I would change with the way of teaching would be to do more in class examples. Instead of just going over the notes slides, during each class period he could pick a problem or two out of the book and work them out with the class. Having the problem on the board and having us tell him what code to put into matlab and if we are incorrect, correcting us and explaining the reasoning behind it. I believe this could make the class much easier, instead of being more independent having group practice like that stated above. :: He was pretty effective for this course. A few things I had to re ask him and ask if he could explain it in a different way, but overall good. :: Very effective. :: About half the time it made since and the other half was difficult. :: good. :: Dr. Thomas has an effective teaching style.  The fact that you are given examples to work during class and assistance from both him and teaching assistance while  completing these exercises helps to understand the problem and the solution.  My only suggestion would be to add Tegrity based recordings of examples so that students could review these outside of classroom for reference and when they miss lectures. :: Great guy but I didn't really feel like he taught anything until the end we just worked on homework and asked questions at the beginning then at the end of the semester he started doing more teaching. :: Thomas is a good professor and a good person, but the class wasn't set up well to showcase his ability. He talked/lectured on topics in the first 10 to 20, sometimes 30 minutes of class then moved into open lab where students could get class work or homework done for practice. If you didn't know what you doing, much like myself many times, then you had to wait for one of 2 TAs to come and help you. so the classwork moved slow"
2935,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: of course. :: Yes. :: Yes! He told us from the beginning that he was going to push us mentally. :: yes. :: Yes. He explains how he grades on day 1 and follows that procedure for every exam. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. The expectations were clear. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Not exactly. :: no. :: Yes 100%. :: Yes. :: yup he did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: The instructor graded work as described in the syllabus. :: yes most times. :: Yes, did a great job, was very fair with the grading. :: Yes, he did. He graded kind of tough, but was fair about it. :: YES. :: Yes. :: good. :: Most instructors adjust the syllabus throughout the semester in response to external variables.  This is one the few courses that I have had that followed the syllabus and schedule.  Our only adjustment was delay the due date of a few homework assignments due to the Thanksgiving holiday. :: Yes, I thought he made the test way harder than they needed to be compared to the homework though. :: yes he did"
2936,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, in fact he was never late and made sure he started at the exact time.  On most days, some or all of the class period was devoted to letting students work on their homework assignments and answering questions.  They did have the option to leave early, if they wanted to. :: yeah. :: Yes. :: Always on time. It would have been nice to have worked on things together as a class, rather than by ourselves with the answers in front of us. :: yes. :: Class was always on time but I did not always find use of the class period helpful. I think more involved examples would be more beneficial than in class assignments with only three people you could ask for help in a room full of thirty people. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, though attendance was not strictly enforced. :: Yes. :: Yes and spend it very well. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yea. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes , he always answer the questions if someone's has. :: yes he did. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Definitely started class on time, though the majority of the class period was just working on homework or in-class assignments. By attending class, I got the benefit of extra credit and asking the teacher or the two TAs or my fellow classmates for help when needed. :: The instructor started class on time every class and ended at the appropriate time. :: yes. :: Always on class and was there to answer questions and help with our problems for the entire class period. :: yes he was their 5 min before and would stay until the end of class time helping students. :: YES. :: yes. :: good. :: Dr. Thomas was prompt, and ready to begin when the class was supposed to.  Class time was well spent, as discussed in section 1. :: yes. :: yes the full class was used, but more than half was open lab time on most days"
2937,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He always answered my questions, and his methods of posting homework and past exam solutions online, allowing us to use our textbooks during the exams, and giving us the option to skip the exams and transfer their weights to the final were big helps to everyone. :: he intend to help me very well. :: By always offering to review old material whenever I needed help. :: He was always willing to answer questions, no matter how silly. He also had tons of office hour opportunities, which was very helpful. :: making sure we understood things especially when test scores showed that we might not. :: The instructor periodically came around during class time to ask questions. :: Asked for input and helped often. :: yes. :: He walked around and made sure we were all doing okay. This was more than I expected, and I appreciated it. :: He is nice. :: He made it like challenging. :: very well, motivate me for a better work. :: bad. :: he gave us the full time to learn how to use the material and he comes to us if we have any questions. :: good. :: I didn't notice any demonstraion of interest. :: not enough. :: This instructor Is  knowledgeable of the course material.  And he explained how much Matlab  can be a very powerful tool. :: he is really enjoying. :: By his attitude. :: good. :: he took time out to work with the class on how the can improve and what they did wrong. :: he gave useful examples and helped those struggling with their assignments. :: The instructor demonstrated interest by using different techniques to solve problems illustrated. :: i feel like it will effect my future work. :: He would explain the real life applications of some of the stuff we learned, and stressed how valuable MATLAB is as a tool to engineers. Made our growth of knowledge feel extremely valuable. :: he always asked questions making sure everyone understood and would walk around asking if anyone had any questions. :: go in each student every class asking if there is any question.. :: He did well with this. :: good. :: Dr. Thomas demonstrates this by lecturing for only a portion of the class and then assisting students the rest of the class. :: he talked of projects he has participated in/supervised and about just how important matlab is in today's engineering world"
2938,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He communicated very well. :: very intense and good. :: Very well. :: Very well. He notified us with homework changes promptly and was quick to respond to emails. :: very well. :: Emails were sent and replied to in a timely manner. :: Very well. :: very well he was clear and able to present the material in different ways to make sure i understood. :: Questions were answered readily and completely. :: Kinda the same. :: He is friendly and like to help. :: 100%. :: he is friendly. :: very good. :: Well enough. :: .. :: If I had any questions he will fully explain it to me.  And he will not leave me without answering my question. :: He is friendly. :: he is very effective. :: In the class he goes between students if anyone has a question  Out of the class there could be emails. :: nice. :: some what effective. :: good. :: The instructor provided immaculate communication in and out of the classroom. :: very good. he was clear. :: Good. :: he was pretty effective in communicating he would answer any questions you had and would come to you in the work time to answer your question until you got an answer. he was also very good at emailing you back within 24 hours of your email. :: very effectively. :: Never had problems getting a hold of him. :: good. :: We would routinely get updates as to the classes' status regarding the syllabus before lecture began, and received updates via email and Pilot on a normal basis. :: Great. :: well. assignments and syllabus was clearly outlined on pilot and due dates were posted. he would email directly if he had an immediate issue needed adressing"
2939,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, they were extremely well organized and we were always on schedule. :: Yes. :: Yes. It would have been nice to do more problems as a group. I feel like that would have helped make the information and codes make sense. :: yes. :: Well organized. :: yes. :: I would have liked some of the later lectures to go more in depth as to what the code was actually doing, instead of just saying: ""This is the problem, this is the code."" Some of the functions we used in the code I looked up in the help feature of matlab to learn how to use them. This may have been intentional, though. :: Yes. :: Yes, kind of. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: NO. :: No.  Scott is a great instructor in all other class, except for Matlab. his lecture style is like self learning.  It's almost the same as taking a class online, which but made this course challenging for me. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: kindoff. :: yes. :: yep. :: Lectures were well thought out, easy to follow, and easy to comprehend. :: yes. :: Extremely. :: yes, it was done by chapters which were clear cut. :: very well. :: Somewhat. :: good. :: Yes. :: The ones we went over were. :: yes"
2940,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, he was available in class, at office hours, or by email. :: Yes even answered questions on the weekend. :: Yes! Always responds to emails and he had tons of office hour opportunities. :: yes. :: The instructor was readily available during class and had many office hours. :: Yes. :: yes he was always in his office during office hours and was just as helpful as he was in class. :: The instructor was always available to answer questions. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: NO. :: Yes indeed.  My only comment about his office is, i wish if he have a laptop or a computer in ordere if someone happen to have a question about Matlab. :: Yes. :: yes he is. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: never went, but yeah. :: yes. :: Very. :: yes, he would answer any questions you had and would work with you if you couldn't see him during the office hours to meet with you when you could. :: YES. :: Yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes"
2941,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He's very enthusiastic about every subject he teaches. :: The only improvement I feel that could be made would be to put more of an emphasis on the for and while loops section. This by far was the most difficult part of the class in my opinion. Also I really appreciated how the Dr. Thomas had the syllabus laid out with all of the material including the homework's. This gave me a complete heads up as to what had to be completed and when it had to be done by. :: I really appreciated just how caring of an instructor he is. He is also one of the most fair professors i have ever had. It was very appreciated!. :: It might help for him to do more examples during class time, to make going to class a learning experience and less of a lab time. :: The class went okay. The only thing I wish we did more of was guided examples. :: The structure of teaching the course could use some tweaking. Rather than expecting us to read and learn outside of class and do problems in class, it would be more beneficial to have a 50/50 of lecture and problem solving during class meetings. The way it is set up gives no motivation to attend class. Also, rather than having students solve problems themselves, it would be more helpful to go through the problems with the class to understand the thinking behind each step. :: Nothing to add. Thank you. :: No, and keep it like this. :: The professor gives the exact way to success the class. :: no. :: just to make more grades on homework and other staf to make the pass not tough. :: no. :: NO. :: This course supposed to teach me how to deal with Matlab and how to be able  to solve complicated engineering application. One unreasonable chalange i incounteres is i had to solve applications from classes that we didn't take yet. For instance sometimes we want to solve problems from calculas III while i am unable to do them with a pincle and a paper Another thing, you are extremely fair.  I really appreciate that  and I know you are trying to be fair because you want to treet everyone  equally. But that is not right because it's not justic to be fair with every one.   Students  who came to every single class  and do bad on the test are not the same as students who don't come to one class and do bad on the test. :: No. :: the second midterm was little bit hard. :: Explain more in the lectures. :: no. :: nope. :: Instead of having a full work day it would be more beneficial to the students to go over the in class assignment questions or do more sample questions in order to get a larger variety of the types of questions that will be asked and a overall better understanding of the material. :: i wish exams content would be more clear. :: None other than that stated in '1'. :: overall a good professor. :: NO, everything was great to learn. :: good. :: Given Dr. Thomas' format for teaching I would recommend him to any fellow students and consider taking other classes he teaches as technical electives, since they are not required for my major. :: no"
2942,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was effective in explaining material as well as explaining any problems. :: He was very helpful when i needed it and overall he was very nice. :: He is very good instructor, but he is very mean in the exam. :: Good teacher. :: This instructor was very helpful and communicative throughout the entire professor. :: Very poor, i know hes a good teacher in other classes but in this one, he failed to teach. Giving homeworks and the answers during class and pretty much making this a study hall time, is a ineffective way to teach. :: Quite effective. :: The instructor was fairly effective. He helped out a lot. :: great instructor, easy to talk to and approach. :: Goodish. :: For what the course is Scott Thomas did a good job. With something like MatLab the course is bound to be more like a workshop then a lecture. :: He along with the TA's helped with specific problems students had, however most learning was strictly from the book/ through homework. :: I would describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor as minimal, because he did not lecture or go into detail on how to go about solving a problem. He gave the most basic explanations and left us to resort to our textbooks, but not even then did the textbook help. :: He teaches for the first 10minustes of class the we hav. Then we hav class workform the rsest of time and the TA 's were never vere y help full, Thomas was a good helper but not a got teacher. :: Not at all helpful. :: Cool guy but needs to spend more time going over the basics and in more detail. :: When Dr. Thomas actually decided to teach he was pretty effective but this was a rare event as it was often just a ""do your own work and if you have questions we'll try to help"". When questions were asked it was hard to get a definite answer as it seemed like Dr. Thomas wasn't very sure of how to do a lot of the problems. :: The instructor is enthusiastic about the subject but teaching is still hard to find. Solutions are given for problems but some are very hard to follow. Programming of any kind benefits greatly from good examples. :: Good. :: The instructor was very good teaching and helping the students. :: Moderately high. Scott is a very approachable and informative professor. However, I do not agree with his ""teach yourself"" hands-off style. As he did actively hold lecture, it only accounted for about 40 percent of class time, which I found to be ineffective. :: Scott Thomas was a very effective instructor, his teaching style improved greatly as he went throughout the semester, and he applied his real world experience he had personally to the course in order to keep me engaged. :: pretty effective. :: Very effective by describing the material behind the course as well as showing numerous examples. :: He gave us plenty of lab time, and would walk around answering questions. However, lectures seemed fairly short with not enough examples. :: Professor Thomas is an extremely nice guy and it very helpful when you ask him questions. He knows what he is talking about for sure. :: The instructor was available for extra help out of the class room, and was great about explaining the topic. He paid extra attention to those select few students who showed that they would put in the effort for his class. overall perfect professor for the position. :: excellent. :: The instructor was not very effective; most of the time we were working on our own and the only interaction we had with the professor was if we had questions regarding our programming. He did lecture occasionally, but for the most part we were left to learn the material on our own. :: was a very good instructor. needs some improvement for lecturing but very easy to talk to. :: Dr. Thomas is a very nice guy, but he is not very effective in teaching the material.  He relies solely on the handouts he's already prepared and loaded on Pilot.  The classes are basically free-for-all, as he and the TA's walk around looking for questions to answer.  This is not always the case, but he treats (and promotes) this course as if you can learn it yourself, at home, online..and then show up for the tests."
2943,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes all work was evaluated based on syllabus expectation. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: he established the expectations early on and held them constant throughout the entire semester. :: yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes, he had everything laid out within the syllabus describing what should be expected. He also talked about what was expected in class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Scott Thomas was very strict on his syllabus to an unreasonable point. As a freshman, I did not fully understand my rights as a student and I feel he took some advantage of that with his testing policy. I was required to attend a family funeral as a pallbearer and asked if I could either take the test early or late due to the time and date of the funeral being at the same time as the test. I offered to present proof and anything else needed, however he simply answered with the syllabus clearly stating the policy of tests not being made up ""for any reason"". It was not until it was to late that I found out that I could have possibly done something about this by speaking to administration. :: Yes. :: I tried my best but i just couldn't pertain the information, Thomas needs to focus on teaching how things are performed in class, like in depth . :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Dr. Thomas graded our work a little harder than expected, taking off too many points for little insignificant things that didn't show any sign of not understanding the topics. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. The expectations were clearly defined in the syllabus. :: Yes, Scott Thomas was very clear on expectations and followed through with them 100%. :: yes very much so no surprises in this class. :: Yes. :: Yes and No, most of the content in class was reasonable. However, the test were unreasonably difficult. :: Yes, he graded and evaluated my work based on the solutions he gave out in class in order to help us reach our goal of understanding. :: he did evaluate the students work more based on his expectations. so if that student had prior experience to programing, or mat lab, it was easier for them. those students like myself, who had no prior experience struggled. yet I made it my goal to get to know him and put in the effort that he asked for. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, although explanation was not thorough.  At times, he did not know how to answer certain questions until I figured them out on my own, at which point he said, ""Oh..I've never used that before."""
2944,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes class always started on time and generally lasted the entire period. :: Yes he started the class on time and used the whole period. :: Yes. :: always on time. :: yes he was consistently early and held class to the end. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The instructor did routinely start class on time. However, most of the time, he did not lecture the full class period. He allowed us time to work on in-class assignments and homework so that we could ask questions. :: class was always started on time, i wish he taught more. class was ran trail and error most of the time. to me id rather be taught what we need to know, shown examples of code, then work the HW or class work. I tried not to but i found i used the HW code as a crutch because we were never taught the material. :: Yes, kind of. :: Yes. :: Class was started on time. The entire period was not used for teaching purposes, but mostly for lab time to work on assignments. :: He started class on time, but students rarely stayed the full class period because he would have us just do homework in class everyday except for the days he lectured which were once every two weeks. :: he was always there at 930 but once teaching was over(20-60 minutes), we could leave if we wanted. :: Yes but did not use the entire time ever. :: yes, when applicable. :: yes. :: Dr. Thomas started class right on time every day, but didn't always us the class time to its full potential. :: Started class on time, but did not use whole class for teaching, much of it was practice questions. :: Yes. :: Yes, every time. :: Yes. 9:30 AM every single class. :: Yes, Due to the nature of the course, we did have a significant amount of lab time, which always lasted until the end of the period, during both lecture and lab, Scott Thomas and both of his TA's were available for help and provided a great learning environment. :: The days he did lecture it was mostly brief, with optional lab time was a big benefit to the class. :: He would start class on time everyday and ran class till the very last minute. :: Yes. :: Yes, class started and ended right on the dot. Used whole class period to help students who had questions. :: always started the class on time. generally would denote class to either a short lecture, and a lot of lab time. would frequently walk around always asking the individual students if they needed help. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, and people left whenever they wanted because there really wasn't any teaching going on."
2945,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Instructor was very interested and determined to make the course interesting for everyone else. :: I think i started it with having an interest in the class and going through the class got me more interested although the class was difficult. :: He was very helpful in one on one learning in class time and during his office hours. :: yes. :: I was not paying attention to such things, so I do not know. :: The instructor talked about how matlab is used in real-life applications. It made it more interesting. :: out of 10, id say 7. i felt he was very well educated and knows the material but conveying it or teaching it wasnt the best. :: He made solid attempts at answering all questions. :: Scott Thomas and his aides were always available during class time to help with any problems. :: Was excited himself about the subject, however there wasn't much done to take interest in individuals. :: He gave us real world applications. :: he tried to help me. :: He didn't. :: Asked if we ever needed help or to ask questions at any time. :: Although Dr. Thomas struggled relaying some of the information about certain topics, when he was asked questions he seemed like he genuinely cared whether or not we understood the content. :: Real world problems, real world applications, much enthusiasm. :: He helped every person who asked for help in class. :: He sent emails and tried every way possible to help the students. :: By holding review sessions for midterms and making sure we understood the information during homework. :: The Professor repeatedly asked for feedback on his teaching style and was very accommodating to our needs both as a group and individually. :: He and the TA's were constantly walking the room and answering questions that anybody had. :: He would reply to my emails quickly and effectively. He would also pause to see if anyone had questions frequently throughout the lecture. :: Yes. :: This was one of the weak areas of the class, as we were expected to kind of teach ourselves, without much ""intro"" to the topics. But, he counteracted this by walking around class and helping us understand when he questions. :: this really all depended on the student. the instructor would walk around the class, and provide support for those students who asked. :: He did not. :: very passionate about the subject and showed he wanted the best for those of us in the class. :: By walking around waiting for questions?  Although he would tend to stick with one student for a long time while the TA;s would try to cover all the other students with their hands raised."
2946,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor was very effective in and out if the classroom. :: communicated pretty effectively and was great at teaching and helping in and out of the class. :: He always asks the students if there is anything that he can help with. :: good. :: he was clear with the material he explained in and out of lecture. :: very well. :: Quite well. :: The instructor was very effective with communicating both in and out of the classroom. He helped out with any questions we had. Also, he would respond to emails as fast as he could. :: very well when needed. :: About as effectively as the next guy. :: Scott Thomas was effective at communicating one on one while problem solving scripts. I did not see enough of his lecturing to have an opinion on that, I also did not attempt to contact him outside of class. :: Good communication through email. Would answer in class questions as well. :: Wonderfully, but he was a very busy man so he didn't have the best office hours. :: fine, never ouside. :: Not at all effective. And lacked explanation much of the time. :: well enough, when applicable. :: Very effectively, had lots of office hours. :: Dr. Thomas was fairly effective in his communication about anything when it was needed. :: Well throught Pilot and in the Classroom. :: Great. :: Very good. :: Very well. Timely responses to emails and questions. :: The Instructor was very effective at communicating and was very easy to get ahold of, both in class and through email outside of class. :: In the class room well, never had to email him but he answered them quickly from what I have heard. :: Replied to emails quickly (sometimes with in hours but usually within a day). Always refereed us to meet with him during office hours and stayed after class to assist with questions. :: The communication on adequate. :: He did a great job, sending us emails about new updates and other information. In the classroom he was very attentive of the students who needed help, also had TA's running around helping as well. :: very well. :: good. :: He communicated well both inside and outside of the classroom. :: in the classroom could use some slight work but i believe that was due to the size of the class. outside of the classroom was very helpful and willing to answer questions. :: He tends to go off in tangents during class.  With regard to out-of-class communication, he is very unwilling to compromise based on the instructions and requirements put forth in the syllabus.  He refused to give any leeway with a particular homework assignment due to a hospital-related emergency situation, despite the fact I contacted him the night before to let him know.  Please keep this private, as it is a situation in which he would know that I had communicated this issue, and I am concerned about bias in his grading."
2947,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes they were, although more practice exam problems would have been helpful for the other exams. :: Yes. :: yes. :: everything was laid out in a methodical manner. :: no, they were as described before, it was learning on your own, or having background in it, or learning things wrong. :: Yes. :: The course content was well organized. The lectures were also organized. However, sometimes I wished the lectures were longer and more involved with examples so I could understand some of the material better. :: for the most part when he taught, when given the class to work our HW was nice except with only 2 TA's and the instructor it was hard to always get questions answered in a timely manner. :: Yes, kinda. :: Yes. All of the content was available online, lectures, homework, solutions. I really appreciate the amount of effort taken to make the content for this course available online. :: Yes, however there was not much to organize. :: No. :: i'd say so. :: Not at all. :: yes. :: No. :: The lectures for MATLAB were not structured very well as it seemed he just read off of an answer sheet the whole time. :: Yes, but very compact at times. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I don't believe so. This class was very fast-paced and was much more difficult than other entry-level MATLAB courses I have taken. :: Yes, the course was on track 100% and all of the course content was taught effectively. :: Yes very well organized and went right along with the book and syllabus. :: Very well. The entire course homework/lectures were all posted online. So if there was anything missed in class you could always refer back to it. :: Everything was well organized. :: Yes, everything was in a great order and organized properly. :: yes. provided additional info and problems for the course. :: yes. :: There were very few lectures, but what lectures there were were organized. :: yes. :: Yes."
2948,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes they were. :: yes he was. :: Yes. :: always. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never needed such assistance, so I do not know. :: Yes, the instructor was reasonably available and responsive to my needs. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I did not attempt to contact Scott Thomas outside of class, therefor I have no opinion on this matter. :: Responsive through email. :: Somewhat. :: never tried and. :: No he often told me to look it up on google if I glad questions. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never read into his office hours as the way I learned didn't necessarily mesh with how Dr. Thomas taught. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, no problem there. :: yes, at no time did I feel like I could not get ahold of my instructor. :: As I said he responded quickly to emails from what I have seen. :: Yes as stated previously. :: Yes. :: Yes, always answered emails and had office hours. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never had a need to communicate with him outside of class. :: yes. :: Yes."
2949,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 1020,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Not at this time. :: i think something that could have been change was the weight scale of the exams, although the class didn't have a lot of other things 90% of the class being exams is a pretty high number, but still achievable. :: Test's seemed to be a little more challenging than what expected. :: His lecturing was quick and difficult to keep up with at certain times. He focused on learning by doing with this particular course and could have spent more time going over the process for the computer program in more detail. :: no. :: I enjoyed this class. It was a challenge. I did like how the homework solutions were posted onto Pilot. It helped me understand the material a lot better. I would definitely like to have Dr. Scott Thomas as a professor again. :: He would run through a power point real quick and then we'd just work on our computers for the rest of the period as he and the TA's walked around answering questions. Some people took issue with this, but I thought it was a pretty effective way of presenting and course material. It's really not a difficult class, I've been getting A's on the exams having not even attended most of the lectures. You just need to practice a bit. The in class assignments and homework assignments prepared me well for the exams. I would recommend this instructor for other students looking to take this course. :: Nope. :: I have heard good and bad tings about Scott Thomas and I believe the reason to be that he caters only to certain students learning. Those who were good at teaching themselves and learning from the book or were already well versed in programming succeeded in the class, while those who really need an instructor struggled. This may simply be due to the nature of Matlab, however I did not feel like I learned anything from Scott himself. I was able to learn some simple concepts on my own, but once the class reached more technical points that I needed help understanding, I felt that there was really nothing I could do. Besides that, I also felt wronged by Scott for being unable to take a test due to a funeral which I was required to attend which I believe should be treated no differently from legal obligations. :: I would not recommend him to my peers. He is a great person, but an aweful professor. His exams are extremely difficult. :: Professor, is there any was you could pass me this with a letter grade D or C, because i don't think i'll do to well on the exam and i already have an F. :: no. :: Needs a better method to teach the course rather than powerpoints every so often, that don't make sense. :: I think simulink was sometings distant for the whole matlab semester, I mean, we had to learn the whole new system in just one week for the final exam. :: No. :: Scott is a wonderful professor, I just wish there were more in-class examples he would work out with us step by step, instead of giving us a list of problems and letting us try blind. :: Scott Thomas is a great instructor and I look forward to taking additional courses with this instructor. :: Great class very helpful. :: Probably one of the best teachers I have ever had. Very effective. Lectures are interactive. Homework/tests/quiz grades were given back faster then any other teacher I have ever had. :: Hes a really good teacher, ready to answer any questions that he can. I just feel like things weren't explained well enough for me in lecture to be very proficient. As well as the test being unreasonably difficult, for an already difficult class. :: Professor Thomas is a very cool guy and knows Matlab very well. Very helpful and easy to understand, willing to ""dumb"" down things to make it simpler for students to understand. I only suggest that in the course for the future that there is a slight bit more effort in actually ""teaching"" the topics, as sometimes leaving the students to figure it out for themselves can backfire. But other than that, the class is great and I have learned a great deal about the Matlab program. :: no. :: I have no additional comments. :: no. :: I am disappointed in his class and ability to teach, and I will search out different professors for my classes going forward."
2950,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 2120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Thomas was a thorough instructor, who went over the material well. :: Very good instructor, knows what he talking about and can relay the information in a way you can understand it. :: Very thorough in his instructions. He will give you all the tools to succeed in this class as long as you put forth some effort. :: Very effective. Gave numerous examples to show every step in depth detail. :: He was very effective in his teaching. :: Professor Thomas is a good teacher.  He makes the test very challenging so we can learn from our mistakes. :: bad. :: I like the way you teach and the way you assign homework. It very clear and helpful with the solution manual. Sometime you go too fast in the lecture and I dont have much time to copy down and not enough time for me to soak in. My learning would be more effective if you just slow down a little bit. :: The instructor did a great job at explaining the course material and making sure that everyone could follow along. :: Very effective teaching style. It was easy to understand the concepts but the test were a little difficult. :: I choose you Scott Thomas! Teach statics! It was super effective. :: He seemed eager to teach and legitimately wanted you to know the subject. However, the tests were far too hard. :: The instructor went over all problems and explained them well.  He was well prepared for class and rarely made any mistakes. :: Great teacher. One of the best teachers I've had. Cares about his students' success. Explains things in a clear and orderly manner. Class time spent well. He was never late to class and rarely let students out early. He took advantage of every minute of the class period. From a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest, I would rate him as a 9. :: nice one. :: the instructor taught the subject very well. :: Great instructor always willing to stop his lecture to answer any questions. :: Dr Thomas is a very good instructor. :: He was a good instructor. I learned a lot from his teaching and examples. :: ;kauwhff;i;iawjiweuh. :: Explained well, at times topic became dry. :: Dr. Thomas was an excellent instructor, and explained the process in detail. I feel confident in doing any statics problem (after our final class this week). :: He was very effective at explaining the material. His exams were tough but tested the material well. :: Always willing to help. :: Dr.Thomas was able to display the information needed in a detailed way in order to teach the material properly. His outgoing attitude made the class more interesting and easier to follow along. :: Dr. Thomas is effective and organized in his presentation of the material. :: Dr. Thomas was a very good professor and was very good at conveying the content in a way that everyone could understand. :: Dr. Thomas is a great teacher. The enthusiasm he shows towards the subject makes learning much more engaging. Grades are not acquired easily,one can expect to have to work for a passing grade in this class however, if i had it to do over again Dr.Thomas would be my chosen professr every time. :: Scott was a very effective teacher. He would go through the topic very thoroughly, and then would do examples do back up topic. Scott was available by email, office hours, or appointment if you needed help with a question or understanding a topic. The information was difficult, as stated by the prof, and he did his absolute best to make the material as understandable and doable as possible. He was the biggest reason I was able to succeed in the class, by giving all the necessary tools to do so. :: Very effective teaching methods. :: The instructor is very effective in teaching this class. He provides lots of examples and will answer any question when asked. :: Honestly the best the best professor I have this semester, very clear in his teachings. :: Scott is a very fair professor and teaches very well. I hope to have him for more classes in the future. :: He was very good in the beginning of the semester at taking his time going over the basics but as the semester went on I wish he would have taken some of the more difficult topics slower because people seemed to struggle a lot more as the course went on. :: Scott Thomas is a very effective and knowledgeable instructor. I always enjoy going to his class and learning the material fluently. :: Very effective. :: Dr Thomas was very good at teaching the material. But sometimes lectures felt like a drag and were somewhat boring. :: His explanations were always helpful, his lectures were fast-paced but very effective, his exams were fair but still challenging, his homework bolstered my knowledge of statics, and he generally held my attention. All in all, he was probably one of my most effective professors of the semester. :: Very good instructor and very clear about his lectures. :: great. :: Extremely effective. I really felt like I learned a ton of material in his class. Very tough, but fair when it comes to the material taught and when it comes to grading assignments. :: very effective. :: great teacher very enthusiastic about the class and taught by example. :: He was very helpful. :: -answered any question that you asked and explained it well and in a different way if needed. :: Scott Thomas was a great teacher and I will not hesitate to take another class taught by him. :: Extremely effective. Learned more than I thought I could about stuff that doesn't move. :: Did a great job. Made sure we understood the material but at the same time was on task and at pace. Every second of class time was used"
2951,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 2120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- He laid out the expectations early on in the class and held us to it throughout the entire semester. :: yes. :: Professor Thomas was fair and made it clear how we would be evaluated on all the exams and homeworks. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The expectations were laid out in the syllabus and the work was evaluated accordingly. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was clearly stated in the syllabus and was followed well. :: yes the instructor made everything clear on the syllabus and showed us everyday what expected. :: He said tests would be hard, but they were still too hard. :: Yes, all material was covered on time with no change to what was on the syllabus. :: Yes, very much. :: of course, a great instructor. :: yes he told us exactly how he would evaluate us and followed through with it. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: sdaeroigerogi. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas followed the syllabus to a T. I do not believe there was any deviation from it. :: Yes. :: Yes! The syllabus was very detailed and always correct. It was very helpful to be able to look at the homework assignments in advance, as well as knowing exam dates as soon as the course started. :: Yes, he laid out a very detailed syllabus and followed the syllabus directly. Anything we covered or went over in the class was listed on the syllabus, and even the exams. :: Yes. :: The course followed the syllabus perfectly. :: One word.. he is ""FAIR"". Syllabus followed exactly. :: Yes. Scott goes to the syllabus on a daily basis to show that we are keeping up with what is expected. The grade scale is clearly shown, schedule, and outline for class procedure. It was very easy to follow what was expected, and nothing unexpected came up in respect to evaluation. :: yes. :: Yes. The instructor sets clear guidelines and expectations and followed them throughout the semester. :: The syllabus was a perfect schedule for the class and clearly stated what you would need to do to succeed. :: Yes he did. :: Yes he graded exactly like the syllabus said. However, I personally feel like 85 percent of the grade being our exam scores was weighted a bit heavy. :: Syllabus clearly stated all expectations and was following to a point. Evaluation of expectations was exactly as it should be. :: Yes. :: Dr Thomas, did an decent job on evaluating the work. HW was graded very fairly and expectations for the class were outlined very well. :: Yes. He followed the syllabus exactly. :: He followed the syllabus to the dot. :: Yes, the syllabus was followed precisely throughout the school year. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes. :: Scott Thomas provided a well thought out syllabus and graded fairly. The dates for homework were fair, but sometimes I was not able to finish them until the final lecture on the subject was given. This only left me 2 days to do the homework, which is enough time but adds stress when other classes are also demanding my time and energy. :: Yes. Grading was fair and consistent. :: yes, exactly how the syllabus states."
2952,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 2120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- The instructor was early to every class period and lectured, instructed, or quizzed us until the end of the class. :: yes. :: He was always there at least 10 minutes before class began and started class on time and even stayed after to answer any student's questions. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He was never late to class.  He was always 10 minutes early.  The full class period was always used. :: no. :: yes, awesome class time spending. :: Yes. :: He always started on time and we made good use of the entire class period. :: yes he would start class exactly at the time class starts and would end on time even though he would have more to say. He would not make us stay longer than needed. :: Everyday he was in the classroom ten minutes early and we always went until time was up. :: Yes, he was always right on time, never started early, and ended class right on time. :: Yes, as stated above. :: yeah. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: ewrpoojwre'iijjrijstrhaeth. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas started class on time every time. The last 20 or so minutes he would have us work on a problem then turn it in. If one finished quickly then they could leave. That was the only case of class time not being fully used. :: Yes he was very precise about the time class started. :: Always on time and always spent class time well. :: Yes, he started class right on the dot everyday and used the full class period in order to teach the most material he could. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas was always prepared before the class started and used class time very efficiently. :: ""Its 2 o'clock exactly lets get started""- every day. :: Scott would be there ten minutes before class would start and start exactly at 2 p.m. He would always use the full class period unless he finished the material and then he would let us go ten to five minutes early. :: yes. :: Yes. Class always started on time and the full time was always used. :: Started perfectly on time every class. :: Yes he was always on time. :: Yes he was very effective with time management. :: Always early to class to prepare, never behind schedule. Class time was used productively and the full class period was used. :: Yes. :: Yes Dr Thomas was excellent at starting class on time and taking advantage of the full class period. :: I don't think he was ever late. Not even by a few seconds. He would start class on time every day, and he would end at a logical time. For example, he didn't start a new example problem 5 minutes before we left, but instead would stop the class when the problem we were working on was finished, or to some milestone of importance. However, the time that we did not use one day would be used a different day (by starting maybe a minute or two early, as long as the majority of the class was present). :: Never missed a second and did and used it to the fullest extent. :: He always started class on time and always arrived ten minutes early, which was appreciated. :: exactly the correct time and used all of class. :: yes. :: Yes, just about everyday. :: Yes. :: Yes, I never felt that he was rushing through material or beating a dead horse in lecture. :: Two o' clock exactly! Nearly every day, and those he was late was by no more than two minutes. :: yes every second of class time was used"
2953,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 2120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He encouraged us to seek his help and instruction outside of class. :: yes. :: He made himself available to answer any questions and always made sure to ask if there was something anyone didn't understand. He was very open to questions during class and even after if needed. :: By pausing to ask questions frequently throughout his lectures. :: He applied it to real life situations, which was very nice. :: He would make sure that were understand the topic and was always asking if we had questions. :: no. :: give out examples and some interesting senior design videos are very cool. :: The instructor frequently asked us to do practice problems in class and to turn them in to make sure we knew what we were doing without hurting our grade if we didn't. :: He asked a lot of questions to make sure we all knew what was going on and if anyone had any questions or misunderstandings he would stop and reshow his techniques. :: He was super enthusiastic and enjoyed the subject very much. :: Again, he eagerly wanted you to know the subject. :: He used many effective teaching techniques that made it easy for us to understand.  He frequently got the class involved in solving problems including randomly having us finish a problem for points at the end of class from time to time. :: Demonstrated great interest in my learning. :: made sure everyone understood a part before moving on. :: He was always willing to answer all questions even those that I had over the weekend by email. :: He asked how exams were going, asked about homeworks and always welcomed any questions we might have. :: He seemed like he cared and wanted us to be successful. :: etsh. :: Kept things entertaining as much as he could. :: Dr. Thomas was interested in each students learning and was willing to go out of his way to assist them. :: He would ask us if his calculations are correct for the example problems. :: Always willing to answer questions, no matter how silly or obvious. :: He related everything in the class to real life situations in order to show how they are used, or allow us to see more visually what we are trying to solve for. :: Yes. :: Dr. Thomas made class very interesting and fun to be in. He would often relate our content to things we were learning at the time. It is clear that he is very passionate about what he does and that in itself makes class much more interesting and fulfilling. :: Frequently stops to check for questions and let students evaluate the steps taken in the calculations. :: He would bring up real world examples to show that the material will transfer into the job field. He would constantly stress that the material is important and that it will come up in dynamics next semester. He would also stress over the course of the class that the material is dependent upon the previous lesson, so we need to keep up.

I'm pretty confident about what I learn on Thermo I because of the professor. :: no. :: No. :: it was great, challenging, but not ridiculously challenging like Dr. Wolff. :: 10/10. :: He's easily the best instructor I've had so far in the mechanical engineering classes. :: don't add more maeterial try cover the other stuff better and go over it slower the class was to fast to learn. :: I understand it was a hassle, but posting recordings of the lectures when I was in the class before was extraordinarily helpful for both cases of absence and for studying/reviewing material. :: I like your teaching style, I think your exams can be a little hard, (especially the second one), but I enjoy you as a teacher and look forward to taking classes with you again. :: Great guy, great professor. :: Exams are a little tough and the grading is not reasonable with the entire class as a whole. I suggest revising the grading to help with some of the loop holes. Overall great class though. :: No. :: I have enjoyed Dr. Thomas' class and will look for future courses taught by him. :: I wish the exams were a little easier. :: The class was taught very well. At the end though it seemed to start to rush a bit through the topics. :: In previous semesters of this class, they did not teach Gas Power cycles. With the difficulty of the entire class material as well as the difficulty of gas power cycles, it is overwelhming. I would prefer to drop the Gas Power Cycles to have more time for the other material. Gas Power Cycles feel like they were just tacked into the course. :: It was a pleasure to have had Dr. Scott Thomas as an instructor for Thermodynamics. :: Keep up the good work scott. you do a good job at teaching -Bret Kindred. :: Hard Exams. :: the exams are almost impossible, everyone went into them knowing they would fail. :: I like that he gives all the solutions to the homework and exams online. I am not sure why other teachers do not to this because the only way I can learn from my mistakes is if I know the solution. Scott is always thinking about what works best for the students. Definitely, one of the best professors at Wright State and one the only teachers I have ever had who will do whatever it takes to teach effectively. :: It's a difficult class, but he teaches it well. :: No. :: Best teacher I've had in the 3 years I've been at Wright State. :: Scott is a great teacher. He is hard but very fair. :: I like taking his classes because I know I will learn a ton more than other teachers. but I hate the fact I might fail based off the exams being so hard. also there are grad student in the class and they are counted towards our curve and that's not fair. also the student who are taking the class for the second time should also be graded separate from the regular students. anything you take for a second time your going to be much better at than everyone else. :: He is very enthusiastic about all of the subjects he teaches. :: Keep up the good work!. :: He is a really good professor. One of the best ones that I have had at Wright State University. Little tricky on tests, but very transparent about everything. :: Great teacher that cares a lot about the students and subjects he teaches. The only issue is tests are extremely difficult. :: No. :: No. :: He is very encouraging,motivating and inspirational teacher I have had so far. :: Slow down focus more on why you can make the assumptions, adding the content of power cycles is overwhelming in 3 days. Spend more time on First law and make sure that the assumptions you will be using can be common knowledge rather than a stumping factor through the remainder of the class. :: no. :: No. :: No. :: I think that this material comes as second nature to Dr. Thomas, either through years of repetition or through natural giftedness, but that makes it difficult to learn because he skips a lot of foundational concepts that are easy for him. It makes the course significantly more difficult. :: He was a great asset to have. :: no"

2970,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Yes. He always answers emails and if he is in his office, he will help with whatever you need. :: i don't know"
2971,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Every time we met with Dr. Thomas, it was organized and we got things done. Very effective. :: i don't know"
2972,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. He was always willing to meet with us if needed. :: i don't know"
2973,Scott Thomas,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Awesome professor and advisor. :: i don't know"
2974,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very good instructor. She explained concepts very clearly and easily. :: Very awesome!. :: Dr. Huang is clearly very familiar with all of the topics covered in this class. She covers all topics thoroughly and provides specific examples to the topics covered. She does a good job of explaining any questions that the class may have an is usually attentive to our needs. :: Dr. Huang is a very good instructor, usually providing clear explanations in the lecture, and able to explain it differently if the students didn't understand it the first time. :: low. :: Great!  Very clear!. :: She explained things very clearly and worked out relevant examples. :: She is interactive so it naturally increased my involvement in class. overall it was a nice experience studying under her. :: Knowledgeable, Always Available, interactive and very good with students. :: Excellent. Coursework was made easy. :: excellent. :: Extremely knowledgeable and very effective at conveying the subject matter. :: One of the best in the Engineering Dept. :: Very helpful. Was available when needed and is a fair grader. :: She is best instructor"
2975,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, her exams were fair. Her homework was helpful in preparing us for exams. :: YES. :: Yes, the syllabus in this class stated that our grade shall be based off of test, homework, and a presentation which it is. :: Yes, the grading followed the rubric displayed in the syllabus. :: no. :: yes. :: Her grading was very fair compared to the difficulty of the exams. :: yes, Indeed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes very understanding and helpful. :: Yes. Students were evaluated fairly. :: Yes, she was a fair grader and gave up appropriate information to study for tests. :: Yes"
2976,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, she was there early most days. :: YES. :: Yes, Dr. Huang was very effective in her use of class time without spilling over into additional time. :: Yes, class time was well managed, only ending lectures early a couple of times during the semester. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Always on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Always on time and lasted the whole time. :: Yes. Very punctual/. :: She went over the theory a lot in the class. I wish we would have had more time to do examples and maybe more time to do homework, since everything seemed to go by very fast. Some of the material I felt I was not prepared for and because it was a hybrid class it was harder to tell who knew the concepts and who was new to the ideas. :: Yes always on time"
2977,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She had us all give presentations which was useful for our learning. :: Presentations and Junk. :: Dr. Huang was always available or quick to respond to emails concerning questions about the class. :: no. :: Always available.  Responds within 5 minutes to e-mails.   Very helpful. :: She was able to use the whiteboard and power point effectively to keep students engaged in the topic. :: By giving good live examples. :: Professor is very interactive with students and way she teaches made class more interesting. :: She took care of every individual assessment and helped to improve. :: By giving examples. :: Very willing to help and excited about subject. :: Absolutely. :: She talked about how the theory contributed to the real world application to the products. Sometimes information was given too quickly but overall I understood the general idea of the point she was making. :: Make the content easy to understand
2978,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. There were no communication issues. :: Very well through EMAIL. :: Well, her point came across clearly whenever it needed to. :: Dr. Huang communicated clearly the content and the requirements of the class. Emails were always concise and clear. :: not good. she over a short office hours. class are short and full with un explained information. :: Very effectively.  Extremely helpful. :: She did a very good job in communicating with both assignments and course materials. :: Very effectively. She explained to me even after the class hour so I felt good that I didn't had to take appointment for that work. :: Very Good. Always available to help. :: Always available for questions. :: excellent. :: Very professional and helpful in and out of classes. :: Super-effective!. :: In the classroom I felt she was very limited on time and was always trying to save an idea for the next class. I wish class was longer or we spent more time on examples because sometimes our homework equations for on a power point online that we did not see which lead some people to not complete the homework. :: Good"
2979,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. she is lost. :: YES!  Wonderfully.  Very clear.  Some topics were barely covered and then tested, which was kind of frightening.  But Hong Huang is always well prepared for class. :: Yes. :: Yes it was. :: Excellent. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes but still quite confusing. :: Exceptionally well organized. :: The lectures were well organized.  I think that there were too many times where lectures should not have been strictly watch the screen and then take notes. Instead an example could have been used from a picture found online to get a good idea of what was going on. She was done this before so I hope that for the next class she can combine her method of teaching and have the students be more involved. I think some lectures were draw out and I feel as though she lost half the class 2/3 through class in many lectures. :: Yes"
2980,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, except for one day she was not in her office during hours. :: YESSS. :: Yes, it was never a problem to contact Dr. Huang. :: Yes, Dr. Huang was available during her scheduled office hours and quick to respond to emails. :: not enough. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes she was always available. :: Yes. Always available. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Usually available. :: She always gave her availability or would change a due date of necessary. :: Yes"
2981,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4570,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I enjoyed the course very much. :: NOPE. :: No, it was a wonderful course and the instructor did a very good job covering the material. :: Dr. Huang is great!  Homeworks helped in my learning as well as the tests.  The only constructive criticism I have is maybe to make the course harder and more challenging.  Students will always rise to the level that is expected of them.  Enjoyed the class!. :: No. :: Nope. :: No. :: No. :: I really enjoy her class. I have taken her courses before and will again if possible. :: Course material: Energy Materials is relatively up and coming course. Instructor taught very well and outlined the notes effectively. Unfortunately, in a qualitative content class such as this, not having a book or comprehensive lecture notes caused some struggle for exams. Please write a book for the class Dr. Huang!. :: Dr. Hong is a great professor. I have had her several times before this class and she is the reason why I wanted to take this course this semester. This class was exciting but I feel like she was under the wrong pretense and thought that a majority of the class knew about more the of the basics behind the lectures than we really did. Some lectures were too long but she could tell that we grew less interested as time went on. Overall a good class but I felt ill prepared to take it with little background to understand the topics discussed. A better foundation in Structures and Properties of Materials would have been greatly beneficial. :: No thanks"
2982,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Please see Materials Characterization Lab section evaluation. (I evaluated both the lecture and the lab together.). :: Very clear lectures and material. :: Very effective. Extremely knowledgeable about the topic. :: Fairly effective. :: The teacher was effective, although the material was difficult to understand sometimes. I felt overwhelmed sometimes. :: good. :: Very well explained topics. Details covered clearly. :: The instructor is very effective, however large amounts of information are covered and this student would like more guidance when studying for the final. :: Very helpful and explains topics thoroughly. :: Dr. Huang is very knowledgeable and keen on the subject material for this course. Being a visual learner, she caters to my understanding by providing in-depth explanations with figures and plots. She replicates her lecture notes in an outline format onto the blackboard which makes amending my own notes to hers easier."
2983,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Assignments graded fairly. :: Yes. :: Yes, her homework and tests were fair. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes; however, only 50% of the course grade is evaluated before the final exam."
2984,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Full class time was utilized. :: Yes. :: Yes, she was always there on time. :: yes. :: Yes the class time was well spent. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Huang was prompt and made sure to take advantage of the full time allotted. She offered to have a couple minute intermission to serve as a sort of ""mental break."""
2985,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By asking questions to the students. :: Frequently asked students questions relevant to the previous lecture at the start of many classes. Reviewed covered concepts at the end of every section. :: She taught the things. :: She had us do presentations which were helpful. :: Presentations on a topic of your choice. :: This course involves experiments where students look at microstructural analysis. So in my opinion the topic itself is very interesting. :: The instructor presented the material several times allowing time for the information to sink in.  The subject is challenging and difficult to grasp the first time around. :: Talked about additional applications of topics taught. :: Colorful figures and plots.
2986,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- yes very well. :: Effective at answering questions in lecture and would be available to answer any questions immediately after class. :: No complaints. :: Very well, there were no issues. :: well. :: Emails sent by the prof. were explained clearly according to the task provided. Also with the help of the TA, the communication regarding the laboratory material was very easily executed. :: The instructor was available. :: Well, attentive to questions both in class and email/office. :: Knowing that English is Dr. Huang's second language, there were times during lecture where key words were difficult to make out. How she worded problems was a little confusing at times, but the general message was clear."
2987,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Very clear organization of course content. :: The content was very information dense, with few homework assignments. I would have liked more homework assignments (maybe shorter ones in between the long ones?) to cement the concepts. :: Sometimes it was a lot of information to digest. I don't know if there was a way to break it down more, but overall she taught it straightforwardly. :: yes. :: Yes every technique following the order in the textbook was explained in same manner. However, unrequired course material from the book was explained but not in depth, thus covering every phenomena. :: yes. :: Yes. :: The chronology of the content flowed well in the beginning with optical microscopy and then general electron microscopy, but there was quite a bit of ""jumping around"" between scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Perhaps this was due in part for comparative purposes between the electron microscopy techniques. The textbook was useful, but not entirely necessary. Another text that follows the order of the content would work better."
2988,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Never personally used outside of class time for anything but turning in assignments. One sent email apparently failed to deliver, but Dr. Huang was very accommodating. :: Was available after class, otherwise I did not meet with her. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Huang responded thoroughly and promptly to inquiries via email since I could not meet for her office hours."
2989,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Availability of report criteria and presentation requirements and recommendations would have been nice to have early in the semester to put the work we needed to do in perspective. :: I enjoyed the course. :: Some of the slides provided excessive amounts of information.  Those could be paired down a little. :: Since this is the first class where materials science students get hands-on experience with equipment and instruments, there should be more opportunity for students to use and have access to these precision instruments before this senior-level course and more opportunity in ME 4750."
2990,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- She fairly clear and understandable during her lectures. However, sometimes the way the homework assignments were worded was confusing, and I wasn't always sure what was being asked. :: yes. :: Very effective in lab setting and explaining concepts relevant to lab equipment. :: The following evaluation is meant to cover all the lab assistants. Overall evaluation was passable but flawed. :: Lab work was divided in groups making it easier to complete all the required labs. Also since the labs and the equipment had restricted access, the operator chosen for explaining the lab was successful anyway. :: The lab was pretty effective. We were trying to grasp difficult concepts. :: Describe the labs well so that we were prepared for them"
2991,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Don't know, lab report's not due yet. :: Yes. :: I don't know because there were no intermediate checks of progress. :: Yes. :: As far as the lab work, all evaluation will be derived from the lab report that is submitted at the end of the semester, which is worth a whopping 20%."
2992,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Class began on time and used as much of the period as the lab required, provided equipment was functioning. :: Yes. :: Lab routines were defined by the instructor as per the students availability. This allowed students to perform the labs at their convenience. However allotted times were also provided for students to finish on time. :: yes. :: Yes"
2993,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She taught the full classtime and was always willing to stay after class to answer any further questions we had. :: asked questions of students in our lab section, but also allowed graduate students to explain their work with lab equipment to students. :: N/A?. :: She showed us different lab equipment/machines and had us do experiments with them. This was very interesting and went along nicely with the course material. :: Attentive to questions"
2994,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- She communicated effectively, except for the small confusion that the strangely-worded homework assignments caused. :: effectively communicated all necessary information to complete labs and how it was related to coursework. :: Graduate students did okay jobs of explaining their machines. Most of the information was already had in lecture, but was good to see them point out the real things that were only words in lecture. :: Very well. :: well. :: Well listened to students and questions"
2995,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The content and lectures were well-organized; however, sometimes it seemed like there was way too much information presented in a single classtime. Some lectures went through at least 60 slides, and the information was run through extremely quickly. I thought that maybe condensing the slides down to more concise summaries might have been a better way to help students absorb the material, rather than overwhelming them with it. :: As well organized as can be planned for when equipment malfunctions arise. Very accommodating due to this. :: The machines needed to be checked to make sure they worked before lab began. :: Yes. :: There were equipment problems so it was a little scattered. :: Yes. :: Yes, they gave insight on the equipment and how it worked."
2996,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I did not go to office hours, but when I would walk past her office, she always seemed to be helping a student. So I would say yes, she was reasonably available and responsive to my needs. :: Available for questions and allowed free scheduling of lab time based on students schedules. :: Scheduling was not a problem. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes"
2997,Hong Huang,2015 Fall,ME 4750L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The class contained a manageable amount of material. I thought it was a very useful class. :: I would have liked more direction on the SEM. Ended up taking a picture with a beam that was way too energetic for my material; turned out dark. It was the first time I had used an SEM so I didn't know what I was really looking for. Would have been nice if he had said ""15keV is probably too much,"" or ""That picture is really dark, do you want to try with a 5keV beam instead?"" I would have liked to be there for the EDS reading, even if we had to reschedule it for another week. Being handed magical numbers from nowhere is not reassuring. Please set up the XRD machine that you said you have. :: I enjoyed this lab section. :: Appreciate not having a unique class time for lab. :: Since this is the first class where materials science students get hands-on experience with equipment and instruments, there should be more opportunity for students to use and have access to these precision instruments before this senior-level course and more opportunity in ME 4750."

His in class examples consisted of him showing the entire problem worked through, us frantically writing it down as fast as we could, him explaining the problem during that time, and us finishing writing write as he told us to turn the problem in for credit. Nothing was learned and several of my friends simply played on their phones the entire time. :: he usually reply email back within an hour when outside of classroom he is okay in classtime. :: At times he was a little hard to understand.

The actual tests counted for less than 1/2 of the final grade. This class was mostly a waste of my time.

I think he is good in the sense that he will let you do what you think is best for the application and wont intervene. but that also means that students are prone to make way more mistakes.  but sometimes the only way to learn is from making a mistake.  in addiction, he is not a good professor for this class, or any other class that i have had with him. I personally feel that this class will only fulfill my requirements to graduate because i didn't learn anything from it.

I am disappointed that I only had him for one class before graduation.  He is extremely detailed, organized, and communicates the technical details of the material extremely clearly.  His notes, tests, lectures, homework were designed so that the student thoroughly learns the material.  Absolutely phenomenal. :: The instructor was pretty effective on teaching the course.

His overviews and explanations of important material in lecture go a long way in building a fundamental sense of what is going on with the material, and then homework assignments are designed in a way that requires critical thinking on the students' parts (not just repeating what was done in lecture) to further develop that understanding. :: The instructor has given his best in delivering the lecture but some topics need much explanation. :: I always enjoyed his lectures and his way of teaching.

Gaining some understanding in this subject is a ""work in progress"" and he approached it with this understanding.

It was very challenging while also feeling entirely fair, which is a unique combination to come across.

3046,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He tried to show good examples in class but it was hard to understand what he meant sometimes. He was very knowledgeable on the subject. :: He conveyed the information pretty well, and was fairly responsive to questions. :: Reasenable. :: Low level of effectiveness. Was late to all but two classes, including midterms. He was extremely disrespectful to students when they had questions. Very late on grading. Does not return exams, which leads me to believe that he is simply lazy, and does not want students to compare his grading. This leaves grading entirely at his discretion, so he can play favorites. :: This professor had very detailed lectures but, his homework and his tests seemed to very alot from what he taught in class. :: The instructor was, overall, fairly effective. He explained the material clearly and, through assigned presentations, helped us connect the material with real-world applications. :: horrible, did not learn anything from him. :: Good. :: Very bad,worst-he gave the exam questions that he did not teach. :: below average. :: Overall it's obvious the instructor knew the information. However that did not always translate to teaching. He did a good job of going over all the general subjects in class. When it came to specific problems such as, homework, exams, and in class quizzes, he did not explain very well beforehand. I had to use other sources to teach myself how to begin the homework, I think if he had given more exam type/homework questions in class, I would have learned better. :: The worst professor I have ever had. :: Horrible. Constantly showed up late to class and to exams. Also tested us on content that wasn't taught, but was in the book, which we were told ""Was not required"". :: The instructor was not very clear in his explanations of various parts of the material. I felt that how well I did on exams came down to how many equations I wrote on my formula sheet. :: god awful. :: Not good. :: Good. :: His teaching skills are perfect and can describe the course content in easy way to understand it. :: Overall, Dr. Farajian reinforces a demeanor in his class room that emphasizes that he does not take student learning seriously. He does this by regularly arriving to class late, giving tests that do not adhere to class material, assigning projects that do not contribute to furthering our understanding of the subject, and returning graded material back to students several weeks after the promised return date. :: good. :: Very knowledgeable. Goes into significant detail explaining concepts. :: The instructor did a good job at presenting all of the material that was needed in the course. :: good. :: 7/10. :: He explained the most important points very well and spent them more time than the unnecessary facts.,"
3047,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes it was followed exactly, as far as I could tell. :: Yes, however, the expectations for the group projects specifically were relatively vague. :: Yes. :: Not at all. Exams were vague and grading was entirely at his discretion, rather than fact or process. :: The syllabus was not very detailed. Class seemed to lack structure. :: The instructor did evaluate all coursework based on the expectations in the syllabus. :: no, because what was on the exams was nothing close to what we ""learnt"" in class. :: yes. :: No,he did not. He missed out important points in class and asked those points in exam. He could have described and imparted knowledge on us but he did not. He taught the easiest parts in the syllabus and gave the questions out of the blue. :: no. :: When it came to the group projects, the instructor followed the syllabus expectations exactly. There was no confusion to that. When it came to exam grading scales was where some were confused. :: Not one bit. :: Technically, yes. But the syllabus was so vague in accordance with grades and the grading scale that you never knew what you were gonna get, especially when applied to group projects. :: Mostly, except one instance in which somehow a PDF file that contained a group paper for my first group project could not be opened. Instead of contacting our group and letting us know about the issue, he simply gave us a grade of 60%, without ever reviewing the actual paper. :: kinda. :: No he was all over the place. :: Yes. :: Yest. :: good. :: Yes except project work requirements were not clearly stated. :: Yes. :: Good. :: yes. :: Yes, I think so."
3048,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- No, he was late to almost every single class. :: Oh hell no. This dude was like 3-10 minutes late almost every single class. He used what time remained after that very well though. :: No, he was always 5 minutes late, also he shows up late for every test. :: Was only on time TWICE the entire semester, he was even late to our exam sessions. This is incredibly disrespectful. We students added up all the class time he missed because he was late, and it added up to three total hours, which equates to a week of class. I will be looking to have this refunded by the University,. :: No, he was often late to class. :: The instructor hardly ever started class on time; usually he arrived between 5 and 10 minutes late, and he often adjourned class early. :: no, he was always a minimum of 5 minutes late, most of the time he was closer to 15 minutes late. :: yes, almost. :: No,he always came late to class. He is late like by 5 mins to 20 mins. :: no was consistently late 10 minutes, always first one to leave. :: The instructor was usually 5 mins late, but they did use the whole class period. :: No he was at-least 10-15 minutes late every class. :: No. Almost always showed up 5-15 minutes late. :: I can only remember the instructor being on time to class about 2 or 3 days. While he was late by about five minutes on most days, there were numerous times when he was 10 to 15 minutes late. Class time was mostly used for ineffective lectures that were not particularly helpful with many parts of the material. :: NO. showed up late 3/4 of the time. :: He showed up late nearly every day. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He routinely started class late. This was immensely frustrating. :: good. :: Usually a few minutes late but otherwise fine. :: The professor was late almost every single class period. :: Good. :: no. :: He was sometimes too late (an average of 4-5 minutes), but honestly I was this time too late too."
3049,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He encouraged us to investigate certain topics on our own time. He also asked lots of questions for us to think about during class. :: Well, he answered my questions and engaged with me. He seemed interested in my learning and teaching in general. :: He doesnt. :: He did not. He was extremely disrespectful and condescending to students whenever they had questions. A very rude, lazy man. :: He didnt. :: The instructor asked us questions regarding our presentations, making sure what we had done more than cursory research and that we understood the applications of course materials which we were researching. :: he didn't, last one to get to the classroom and the first one to leave. 30 minutes late to our first exam. :: he clarifies our doubts, by giving extra information, and making us imagine the things. :: No ,he did not. :: not at all omg. :: He did want us to learn, however I do not believe he demonstrated very obviously. :: Nope. :: He didn't. :: He demonstrated no such interest. :: he showed up to class. :: He made it interesting when he taught it but it wasn't my favorite topic. :: Very good. :: Motivates in learning the course in order to learn more materials on the advanced engineering courses. :: good. :: He almost seemed like he didn't care if you passed or failed. :: Good. :: He gave a lot of very interesting practical examples."
3050,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He was decent at communicating thoughts in class. Sometimes he didn't understand students' questions. :: About as effectively as you can ask any person to communicate. :: Never needed. :: Never responded to email, danced around questions when he didn't know the answers in class. :: Emailed important information to students when necessary, but often at the latest possible time. For example, when a test is coming up he will give us a list of topics to study, but that list often comes the day right before the test. Not much time to perpare. Or he wont give us assigned groups/topics till 1 week before the project is due. Not much time to work together as a team and compile a well constructed project. :: The instructor communicated effectively, but often did not give feedback and study guides in a reasonable amount of time. For one of the exams, he posted the study guide the morning of the exam, and we only got one of 8 in class quizzes back through the entire semester. :: he didn't even try. :: good. :: BAd. When I was absent in class,I went to his office during office hours to catch up the missed class but his response was to collect the friend's note. :: awfully. :: The instructor took a while to answer emails, other than that I have no experience with his communication. :: Takes approximately a week for him to respond to emails. :: Not very effective. Always sent out emails/upload homework at the last minute. Because of that, you wouldn't have enough time to get things done. :: Did not effectively communicate at all. He actually chose class representatives for students to tell about their problems so that he would not have to deal with the various complaints and concerns of a mostly confused classroom that was representative of his poor teaching ability. :: bad he did not help much in office hours. :: He was hardly ever avaliable for consultation. :: Bad. :: Good. :: Poorly. After the first exam, students were caught off guard by the material on the first test as it seemed to differ from what was taught in class and on the homework for at least half the test. On the next test, we requested a study guide that would help us figure out where the he was pulling information from. He reluctantly provided a study guide that we discovered to be an outline of the section headers of our textbook showing once again little thought was put into the material he was providing. :: good. :: Email communication was prompt and helpful. :: He didn't fully define what he meant in his explanations. :: Good. :: very. :: Very effective. I liked it a lot when I got a reminder to do the homework via mail. I forgot rarely homeworks in other classes, but I have never forgotten any homework in this class."
3051,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, it followed a logical progression of material. :: It was pretty good. I'd like it if there was additional content posted on pilot, but the whole course progression made sense. :: Yes. :: Not at all. He just ""winged"" every lecture, he had absolutely no class plan. :: yes. :: Course lectures were not very organized. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes. :: sort of. :: The content and lectures were well organized. However, I wish he would have uploaded his slides onto pilot for review. I realize this might not have been possible, since he used the notepad on the projectors. :: No. :: No. The lecture seemed to bounce all over the place with concepts and none of the knowledge was retained because you never went in depth with some of the topics. :: The course content was well organized, yet the lectures did not seem to help in making sense of a good portion of the content. I learned more out of class than I did while attending it. :: no it felt as if he got up there and winged it. :: No, his notes were confusing. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The lectures were well organized and he did make effective use of the book during his lectures. However, there was a divide between his lectures, homework, and tests. :: good. :: Yes. :: The class was well organized. :: Good. :: yes. :: Yes, it was structured and straight forward after the used book for this course."
3052,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He said a couple times that if we had issues we could talk to him after class or during office hours. :: I think so. I only communicated with him outside of the classroom a couple times. :: Never Needed. :: No. Only have 1.5 hrs of office time each week, never responded to emails, was late to every exam. :: Emails were often not replied to, or if I did email he a say a question about homework, he often wouldn't answer till it was already turned in and to late. Same about test questions. :: I did not attempt to contact him either via e-mail or office hours. :: no. :: yes. :: He was available but not helpful regarding course matters. :: at times. :: N/a. :: no. :: No. Again, always did things last minute it seemed like. :: The instructor seems to have a habit of not checking his e-mail for questions of concerns about students for weeks at a time, which either shows that he lazy or that he just does not care. I believe it is a little bit of both. :: yes ill give him this one. :: He never responded to emails. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: He had very short office hours. Less than an hour. :: Good. :: yes. :: I have never had questions at home or to come to office hours."
3053,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- This dude is a dick. That being said, he's not a bad dick really. He seemed really disrespectful, rude, and condescending at first, but I could honestly see myself hanging out with this guy. I bet we'd get along really well. As the course went on, I think we warmed up to each other more. As I said before, he was an effective instructor, and that is his job. Not being #1 most likeable professor, but actually teaching material. Anyway, don't take anything I say too seriously. I'm a real piece of work. :: I have no idea why this man is a teacher. He doesn't know half the information he is in charge of teaching, he is disrespectful to students, he was late to all but two class sessions, he laughed at students' failures. The simple fact that Wright State University has this man as a professor is nothing short of an insult. I feel sorry for every student he is allowed to teach. Information is hardly transferred. If he doesn't respect my time, then I can't respect his. :: -. :: The instructor did not make the material interesting. He did not stimulate my interest in the topics covered, and, while communicating the course content fairly effectively, did nothing more. :: I have no idea why he is a professor. :: no. :: He should be imparting knowlegde regarding syllabus to the greater depth rather than testing our intelligent. Nobody is born intelligent by birth. We are all here to learn not to show how smart we are. He should be teaching his course materials properly not surfacely. Every topic he covered and lectured was surface description only. :: no. :: N/a. :: I know he has tenure and this survey means nothing but man is he an awful professor. :: Should not be allowed to be a professor. Very unprofessional when it came to dealing with coursework, students, and teaching concepts. :: This instructor is the worst that I have had in not only my 3 semesters at Wright State, but in all of my high school career as well. His laziness, tardiness, and incompetence when it comes to teaching has made the whole class suffer through a class for an entire semester that was ineffective at teaching them the skills needed for future courses. :: 10/10 worst professor i have ever had. :: No. :: good. :: Needs to start class on time. I like the idea of using projects to learn because I seem to have responded better to project work than to exams. Plus projects help me understand and do my own research. :: no. :: I liked the way he gave the focus to the mechanical engineering majors which means he gaves a lot of additional examples and information which are for mechanical engineers necessary."
3054,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- best course to learn actual software and concept of the topic. :: teaching efficiently, responsive to questions, behaving well. :: Great teacher. Always willing to clarify and take extra time to explain things. :: Very effective- presented lecture material in a cohesive manner and clearly linked it to the computational part of the class. Explained how to use computer programs well and frequently stayed after class to make sure students were proceeding in the right direction on projects. :: Dr. Farajian is very knowledgeable on the material for this course considering computational materials science is his background."
3055,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes he did. :: Dr. Amir provide the knowledge more than my expectations. He clear many concepts of his subject and allow us to understand it easily. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian evaluated my work with a bias to the upper threshold of knowledge of the graduate students in the class. Dr. Farajian did not format the course content based on the minimum prerequisite course, ME 2700 Structures and Properties of Materials I, which put some students at a major disadvantage."
3056,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: He always began class on time and used all time allocated to class. :: Most probably. He has excellent knowledge of the subject but couldn't convey the material. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian was habitually late to class, sometimes 15-20 minutes after the scheduled start time."
3057,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- excellent. :: He encourages students to involve in class. :: He never use presentation unlike other professors so his lectures are very interactive and deep enough to understand the topic. :: Guiding teams on projects by providing each one a direction to go in, then stepping in to explain what might be going wrong and/or what to try differently when problems came up. :: The lab portion was more informative than the lectures. Seeing through the software what the theory was trying to portray was much more effective. All lectures should have been held in the computer lab."
3058,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- he is a good responsible instructor to answer all questions. :: well. :: He always spend 10-15 minutes extra after lecture to know the progress of his subject's project and help us to reach to the next stage. :: Well. :: His accent can be thick, which makes clarification necessary. He rarely checks his email and at times he fails to respond in a timely manner."
3059,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: I think that they both were. :: Really knows his stuff, but may have a hard time getting his point across from time to time. :: Yes. :: The textbook for this course was titled Molecular Modelling for Beginners By: Alan Hinchliffe, but the content was way more advanced than for the purposes of this course. Despite this, Dr. Farajian was able to structure the content in a chronological order where each new chapter expanded upon the previous one, starting with point charges and moving to molecular dynamics."
3060,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes he is available and responsive to our questions. :: I met him and he motivate me to select his subject and always support us to work more and more on this subject. He is always willing to help to his students. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian rarely checks his email and at times he fails to respond in a timely manner on important inquiries."
3061,Amir Farajian,2015 Fall,ME 4830,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- He is one of the best instructor in the WSU. He is knowledgeable in all materials that relate to the topics. :: No that was all. :: He motivate us and not for only subject prospective, also suggest us what to do for the subjects that can make our CV more valuable. :: I appreciated the hands on experience that this class offered and the opportunity it offered to develop a skill. It may have been helpful to have a homework on the Schroedinger equation, but we did have a chance to work with it during the extra credit opportunities in class. :: Only one midterm and the final exam worth 60% of the final grade give little flexibility in terms of boosting your final score. However, he did offer opportunities for 0.5-1% extra credit towards your final grade. If asked for help he makes one beg for it, and if you ask a question he MIGHT answer it in a manner that isn't condescending. He suffers from a superiority complex. Dr. Farajian is one of those professors that is very condescending, especially to undergrads. This was a problem considering of the 6 students in the class, half were graduate students and half were undergraduates students. He is not very understanding of the fact that undergraduate students have a much heavier course load than the graduate students and that demanding the same amount of work from both is unfair."
3062,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Lectures were not very effective. Learned more from learning from HW, examples outside of class on my own time. :: good. :: This instructor did not teach. He would stand in front of the class and mumble and not be prepared with examples. Half of the time he would mess up and example and need to go back and figure out what was wrong, taking class time to do this. I would have to teach myself from the book, and this is not what I expect out of class experience. Overall a D. :: Good at demonstrating examples. :: Ineffective. Lectures several weeks behind course schedule, assigned to learn an entire chapter's content in a week outside of class. :: Got much better after midpoint evaluation. Good explanations when class allowed you to make them. :: Professor gives good examples and materials in class. HAs helped understand the subject. :: very bad. :: Poor. Knowledgeable on the subject, nice person, but extremely poor educator. Cannot convey meaningful information in a reasonable amount of time. We were constantly on the material and lectures were filled with meaningless information. :: Poor. He needs to organize his lectures better and needs to be more prepared to show a solution to example problems to the class. :: I would rate his overall effectiveness as average. :: Concise but describes material well, good effectiveness. :: The teacher did not do very well teaching the material. He always seemed to get lost in what was being covered and repeated many things multiple times. This caused us to get behind and have to rush at the end the semester. :: Not very well. Wasn't confident in the material he was teaching. Got very lost in almost every question he put on the board. :: He's very scattered and has a tendency to waste a lot of time. :: Not a very effective instructor. He would constantly loop information when lecturing leading to little progress during class time. By the first exam, the class was behind schedule by 2 chapters. :: very bad instructor. he was a very nice guy and didn't make the course impossible to pass but he made learning the material very difficult. :: Not very effective at all. Didn't explain things well, would get side tracked during examples and never go back to finish said example. Very soft spoken and authoritative, very easy to zone out with. Showed enthusiasm about the material, thus I didn't care to be enthusiastic to learn it either. :: Poor !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. :: Fairly effective. If he would have gone over problem more rather than lecture a lot I think he would have been more effective. :: Terrible, he never showed up prepared. Each class was comprised of him showing slides someone else made. He never completed any examples and BSed his way trough the rest. He's an even worse educator than Dr. Farajian and that's saying something. :: Hard worker and always available to answer questions. explain all necessary topic that are related to the course.  Affable and friendly. :: The instructor is friendly and approachable, but has issues with organization and instruction. He is not familiar with how knowledgeable his students are and wastes time describing concepts that students should arrive understanding (trigonometry, summation of forces), which meant that difficult concepts did not receive the appropriate amount of time they needed. :: He was a great teacher!. :: Dr. Mian is a great professor. He is very effective, clear and helpful. :: Overall positive experience.  Sometimes he got sidetracked or confused and ended up confusing everyone else but he did lots of examples and tried his best to try to get everyone to understand the material.  He seemed to genuinely care about the student's success. :: He was a very good instructor and I did learn a lot from his class. :: really unorganized and he is easily confusing himself and everyone. :: He is pretty effective, but he needs to prepare more for lectures. :: He was good, However he needs to do more examples. A whole lot more only because it seems like everyone understood the concepts. :: He is very good. :: Overall this instructor had much desire to help his student to improve in the class, even to the point of having a mid-term course evaluation to see what could be changed. This course also provided review sessions and example problems provided. At some points information could have been explained more clearly, but the main points were understood. :: He is great and very kind. He cares about answering students questions. He is just slow in lecturin which might be useful for some students, but boring for some other students. :: Not very effective at all. Used all previous knowledge from statics to pass this course. :: The instructor was always available to meet with but moved through material slowly and needs to show more examples in class. :: I learned a lot from this instructor, effective teaching methods. :: Dr. Mian was not effective at all. His lectures had no structure, and he did not communicate the material well at all. I stopped going to lectures and just took notes out of the book. :: I thought the instructor was very effective in getting the class to understand a topic and how to apply that knowledge to engineering. He took his time and made sure that everyone understood it. :: His English speaking skill is not good, it is hard to understand what he is saying. Everything else is good. :: .... :: I feel like he wasn't very effective in explaining the material needed. He explained more concepts than actually applying concepts. The examples he did were jumbled and unorganized and hard to follow. :: The professor was fairly effective in teaching the material however,  sometimes he would go on tangents from examples that would make them hard to follow. :: HE IS REALLY GOOD AND HELPFUL. :: The overall effectiveness of this instructor is relatively low. He seems to have trouble holding the attention of the class, explaining things in a helpful manner, and staying on topic. :: Had a hard time keeping the class engaged for a whole class. When everyone was engaged class ran fairly smoothly. :: Overall, Mian was a good instructor. He taught what was relevant and what was going to be tested over. :: Overall decent. Although he often got off track in lectures. :: The overall effectiveness of the instructor was average. :: alright, not great. :: He was not very effective. He could not decide which medium of instruction to use. He would ramble on about a topic for way longer than was necessary to get his point across, then when encountered while doing a problem he would ramble on more about it. He also would go off on tangents. :: ineffective, spent way too much time reviewing basic topics from statics. :: Average. He doesn't present the material in a very coherent manner, but if you can understand his style then you will learn. :: Very good. :: I think that he knows what he is talking about, however his way of teaching isn't the most effective. A lot of the material I had to go through and learn myself. :: Gave lots of example problems and is very good at answering questions. Doesn't seem to be very good at holding students' attention."
3063,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, stayed true to the syllabus minus a few schedule changes due to time. :: good. :: Some of the time the grading was very off the wall. :: Yes. :: Very fair grading on assingments. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: kinda. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Mian outlined his expectations and followed his syllabus. :: Yes. :: Everything seemed to be evaluated to the standards that the syllabus stated. :: Yeah we were tested on the material that was given. Although we got behind about 3 chapters or so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. I have learnt nothing from this class. :: Think so. :: No, he went with whatever he felt. :: Yes. :: Somewhat, he gave out so much partial credit people who never showed up until exams passed fine. :: Yes. :: We are significantly behind where the syllabus said we should be. :: Yes I think so. :: Yes. Expectations were well defined. :: yes. :: Yes. :: nope. :: Yes, but as mentioned earlier. Prepare more. :: Yes. :: yes he did. :: For the most part the work was evaluated based on the course syllabus, there was slight confusion with some of the quizzes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes followed syllabus. :: Yes, syllabus was followed and topics were covered in detail. :: His grading was very fair. :: Yes, I believe what he expected out of us lined up well with what was outlined in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: ..... :: Yes. :: The instructor was extremely fair with his grading. :: YES HE DID. :: Yes. :: The course was evaluated as said in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, I feel that he graded fairly based on the syllabus. :: yes. :: I guess. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did!. :: Yes"
3064,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes always used full class period. :: good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Class ran for the full time with trouble keeping students engaged. :: Yes. Insistently used the entire class period. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Mian started and ended class ontime. :: Yes. :: They did start the class and use the full period time. Though most of this time was used recovering what had already been covered and not teaching new material. :: Yes he used the full time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: When there wasn't communicative or technological interferences/delays, yes. Students began setting up the classroom before the time for class to begin solely so the first ten minutes weren't wasted trying to explain how to move the overhead projector so that the board, and the things written on it, could be efficiently seen. :: Yeah just was a worthless waste of time! With nothing actually taught for most of the semester. It was a sad semester at wright state with this man as a professor. :: Yes. :: No, so much of class was spent wasting time that nothing was ever accomplished. :: Yes. :: The instructor spends a large amount of time doing tasks that really shouldn't take as much time as they do. For example, attendance and passing back papers can be a 20-25 minute activities. Also, transitioning between slideshow portions and whiteboard portions took long amounts of time and were frequent. This does not leave much time for teaching and often results in him going past the time he is allotted for class. This can be especially annoying because I have another class immediately afterward. The instructor has exceedingly poor time management. :: Yes always on time. :: Most of the time. Only once or twice we left the classroom five minutes earlier. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: yea but it was a waist of time. :: He starts the class on time but does not use the full class period effectively. For example, he sometimes read from the textbook to make sure something is correct. Also, Sometimes he gives us ""2 minutes break"" when we don't need it. :: Yes. :: yes he always started on time. :: Class was usually started on time until the ending time, with the time being well spent on the material. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes instructor always on time and went the full time. :: Yes, instructor always used the entire class time effectively. :: Yes but again, not effectively. We were way behind according to his syllabus. :: Yes, he was always there when we were suppose to be starting and he usually used the full class period to teach. :: Yes. :: ..... :: Yes. :: Yes, sometimes he would try and start examples to late in the class period. You CANNOT to a 20 minute example in 5 minutes and make it fully clear. :: YES HE DID. :: The instructor usually taught the full class time and started on time. :: The class was started on time and finished on time; a majority of the time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, class started on time, and taught the whole time. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes usually went over the class period making students late for a next class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did!. :: Yes"
3065,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Always asked for questions, made sure students understood before progressing. :: good. :: He tried to teach us, but it was very hard for him to engage the class. :: By adding on what was taught in Statics. :: Recommended recitations and reviewed exams after grading. :: Held a midpoint evaluation and modified teaching style to suit class needs. Honestly, that's important and I hold you in high esteem for doing it. :: He made sure we were understanding the content on every example before moving on. :: I did not learn anything. :: He knew his lectures were really long and boring so he tried to add jokes in between slides that were prepared before hand. :: Very interested. :: Dr. Mian showed his interest in our learning by asking often if there were any questions. :: Personal contact with students and good involvement in learning process. :: He did this through example problems and quizzes over material we had covered. :: He took passion in the material but wasn't the best at conveying the information to students. :: no one in class was able to pay attention due to the poor teaching and pausing class constantly to read the book and figure out what he was doing. :: Not really. :: NO. :: Taking pauses to ask if we had questions. :: help me to understanding better by asking fundamental question. :: Dr. Mian never appeared apathetic and would do his best to answer questions he was asked. :: Always posted extra material on pilot. :: I think he needs to demonstrate things in more details. Sometimes he goes over things more quickly. :: He continually asked to make sure we were understanding the material and would explain further until we understood. :: He was very interested to see us learn. :: he didn't. :: I learned a lot from him. However, it could have been better. :: It was. :: He used the slides and in class work. :: By asking if the class understood the material, if there were questions. Also asking what he can do differently to better explain the material. :: Yes. :: he was interested and cared. :: Always tried to get the class involved by asking questions. :: Relating to real world engineering examples. :: Yes, but he expected us to know the basic gist of new material without him teaching it. :: He always asked if we had any questions. He would take the time to explain if anything was not clear. He was very helpful to go to in office hours as well. :: He helped me a lot. :: ..... :: He is really enthusiastic about the topic and really wants us to understand the material. :: I enjoyed his slideshow with the jokes. :: TRYING TO RELATE EVERYTHING TO REAL LIFE SITUATION. :: The instructor took a survey mid semester to survey the class response and feelings about his teaching. :: The instructor would repeatedly ask if the class was understanding the material. :: Not sure what this question is asking. :: He asked for questions and input regularly, and seemed interested in our understanding the material. :: he seemed like he cared a lot but had a hard time teaching. :: sort of, he eventually changed powerpoint format so he could post it on pilot. :: Did not demonstrate interest. :: He had us do midterm evaluations to try to better understand how he could improve the course. :: In class questions were answered promptly and well. :: He was enthusiastic and I enjoyed the jokes he put into the slides. :: Pauses lecture to answer any questions."
3066,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Being in a big classroom, and the instructor having a foreign accent, it was often times tough to hear him. :: good. :: He was fast to communicate. :: He was well spoken. :: Poor communication in class, focused on simple concepts for too long. :: Fairly effectively. I feel as though the class itself hampered attempts. :: Effectively when needed. :: it was okay. :: Poorly. :: Professor communicated poorly in class. It was hard to follow along with his lecture. :: Dr. Mian worked hard to improve thoughtout the semester. It seems that english is not Dr. Mian's first language and he would sometimes struggle to get his point out. :: Well in both cases. :: I did not see the instructor out of the classroom but in the classroom he always seemed to get lost in the questions that he was asking. :: Well. :: He occasionally does not answer questions in a clear manner. :: There were some difficulties communicating due to his accent and phrasing. :: well. :: In class - Terrible. Never finished examples, got easily side tracked, couldn't the parts of examples he did do without pausing multiple times to look up how to proceed with the problem. Passed out exams by calling names but never kept control over the volume of noise in the classroom so it was difficult to hear who's name was being called by him since he's so quiet. Out of class - Emailed occasionally about online quizzes, posting of homework, or days that he'd be unavailable and thus no lecture on that day. :: NO. :: Well. :: Extremely poorly. :: perfect. :: Assignments were posted in a timely manner and at no point was I ever confused about when assignments were due. This is something Dr. Mian did well at. :: Very well. :: He responds very quickly to emails. Very helpful!. :: Fairly well with questions in class.  Never tried contacting him out of class. :: decently he was always in his office when I needed him but going to ask him a question I was more confused then before. :: Pretty good. :: Jumping around, however by the end of the semester, he was very straight forward. A lot of improvements happened during the course. :: He communicate very good inside and outside the classroom. :: The instructor returned graded work in a timely manner, as well as updated grades regularly. :: Greatly. :: fine. :: The instructor had troubles keeping the classes attention, the classroom (144 Russ) chairs are incredibly distracting because of the noise they make with the slightest movement. :: Very effectively through email. :: He was fine at sending out emails, that's about it. :: He clearly stated what was expected and he would email us and post on pilot if anything had changed from what he told us in class. :: Not good. :: ..... :: He was very effective in communication. :: The professor was able to communicate effectively as far as assignments being assigned and when they where due. His examples were unclear at times because he would go on tangents about something in the problem and it was very difficult to follow him. I would suggest he work all the way through the example first then go back and bring up the point he wants to emphasize. :: RELLY GOOD. :: In the class room the communication was sub-par. Outside is unknown. :: Communication was better through Pilot and emails than it was in the class. :: Well. :: Explanations could have been clearer, and it seemed as though he was unsure of some details during examples. :: communication was okay in the class room. out side he had office hour that was better. :: Not at all. Once again, he rambled. :: semi effectively. :: good. :: Pretty good.  Accent sometimes difficult to understand, but that's not really his fault. :: He communicated very well and was always sending out emails and posting on pilot for information. :: Communication in class needs improvement. The instructor stammers a lot. Communication out of class is better and doesn't stammer as much."
3067,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not really. Very unorganized, did not seem to prepare too much for lecturs outside of class. :: good. :: They were not well organized at all. He would switch back and forth from the power point to him trying to do examples that were poorly put together on the board. Then we would discuss topics that should have been learned in the pre-requisite classes. I do not feel like I have learned the proper material for this class to say that I have any understanding of the material. :: Yes.  Some notes could have been more organized. :: Course and lectures very far behind schedule, 6 weeks for less than 2 chapters with 6-7 condensed into remaining 9 weeks. :: Yes, especially after midpoint eval. :: Yes. :: yes but he was so far behind in class. :: No. :: No, not at all. :: Dr. Mian's lecures were not well organized or structured but did improve over the course of the semester. :: Yes. :: The lectures seemed well organized but not many of them were used because to much time was spent going over old material. :: No. They were not organized at all. Pick teaching style and stick with it. Don't switch between PowerPoint and board. If you wish to do powerpoint and board dont keep putting the screen down and up leave it up and keep it there. :: For the most part, yes. :: No, the class was constantly behind schedule due to the instructors inability to present material in a progressive manner. The instructor would constantly loop information and would make little progress during the lecture. :: not at all. :: No. No. No no no no no. Absolutely not. 0/10. No gold stars. Not even a clap on the back for a job well done or a shrug for a good attempt. :: NO. :: Yes. :: No. :: yes. :: This was the largest issue I saw. The instructor was poorly organized and made poor choices with the mediums he used to teach. He frequently used a smart-board program so that he could write his slides, however his drawings and penmanship in these portions are illegible and were often irrelevant. For example, the professor once spent 8 minutes drawing a diagram of an example problem that was going to appear on the next slide. The professor does not make effective use of his equipment or time. :: Yes they were. Even though it was off topic the teacher would show the class funny pictures during our ""break"" and they were so funny I really enjoyed that part of the class. :: Lecture slides were very helpful. They were extremely organized and clear. :: yes. :: Decently, they could use some work to make them flow better though. :: not at all. :: Yes and no. Because we spent so much time on the early ""easy"" chapters, so we could not spend that much on the last few chapters. I would suggest doing the opposite. He/you spent so much time teaching (statics) on the first 2-3 weeks. He/you don't need to spend 2-3 weeks teaching (Statics) on a Mechanics of Materials class. :: For the most part, he went by the book. :: yes they were. :: Overall the course was fairly well organized, while some of the courses could have been structured better. :: Yes. :: not at all. jumped all over the place hard to follow. :: Not really, sometimes spent time looking for problems to do, and spent too much time on problem and was unable to finish it. :: Yes, covered both theory and plenty of examples. :: Not at all. He seemed completely unprepared most of his lectures. I never saw him have lecture notes, frequently got confused and lost on example problems. I think he just thought he could wing each class just because he had the slides provided by the book. :: I believe that they were well organized. He would come in with a clear goal for the day and he would make sure that we stayed on course to learn everything needed to succeed. :: Yes. :: .... :: I feel like he needs to come to class better prepared. Maybe use the computer less for examples as it becomes very jumbled very quickly. :: He improved over the semester but I feel he can still be more organized. :: YES. :: The lectures were not terribly well organized. I felt for the beginning of the semester he did not have a very detailed lesson plan, and did not have problems worked out before class. :: The lectures and content were organized. :: Somewhat. :: Course content was good. Lectures were often got off track with random tangents though. :: They could have been coordinated better, but it wasn't bad. :: no they were all over the place and seemed like he didn't have a plan before coming to class. jumped around way to much and was had to fallow. :: The course content and lectures were not well organized. He would go back and forth between the board and the slide show. Then he would start a problem on the slide show, go through part of it, stop, turn off the projector, put up the screen (which took a lot of time) and either start the problem over again on the board OR start a new problem altogether. He also just used the slideshow the book provided which basically repeats the same content and pictures as the book. It probably would have been more effective just to read the book instead of attending lecture. Homework seemed to be an afterthought. At one point he gave us a homework that was due two days later because of a test the following week and he had forgotten to post the assignment. Most students in the class felt that they didn't have enough time to do the work properly because they had to squeeze it into their schedules; whereas, when given a week to complete homework, the student can plan ahead to when they can get it done amongst the assignments and exams in other classes and if they run out of time it is their own fault. He gave out midterm evaluations, and what we told him there was to pick either the whiteboard or the powerpoint, but not to switch between the two, to stop wasting class time on rambling and tangents. The following class period he spent the first twenty minutes reading all of our responses to us. He wasted time telling us we told him to not waste time..irony? After the midterm evaluations the class didn't change at all. I don't know why he bothered to give it to us. My suggestion would be, since he had the lectures recorded, to have another professor or two (considered good professors by students) watch one or two of his lectures at random (some lectures were better than others) and give him feedback. :: No, I dont think there was ever much of a plan and he seemed to lose his train of thought often. :: not really. :: Pretty well.  We fell a little behind the schedule at times. :: Sometimes, there were a few times where we would go completely to a different topic in the middle of another one. :: Yes"
3068,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Never sought the instructor outside of class. :: good. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Offered many times for recitation and office hours. :: I did not require much. Was there for occasional quick question after class. :: Yes. :: I think so. :: Did not use office hours, so I wouldnt know. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I did not need to use office hours or other kinds of outside meetings. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Didn't bother contacting the professor out of class, if I had questions it was easier to ask friends and get a group answer of what we thought was expected of us and what was wanted than to worry about trying to contact the professor. :: Who knows. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The instructor posted his recorded lectures on line, which when played at 1.5 or double speed sounded like he was talking normally. This was an especially helpful resource that I utilized extensively as he tended to speak painfully slowly. :: Yes always available. :: Although he had to travel for conferences for multiple times, he was available all the time through his email. :: He was very responsive. :: yes he did he was good about that. :: Yes, he was always available and responsive during office hours and appointments. :: Yes. :: yes he was. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always willing to meet and provide additional help. :: Yes, he was very helpful in his office hours and he would always email back usually within the hour to any questions that I had. :: Yes. :: .... :: I can't comment on this because I did not meet with him outside of class. :: The instructor was reasonably available and responsive. :: Unknown, I never contacted him outside of class. :: Yes, he was available for appointment. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never tried. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was!. :: Yes"
3069,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 3120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- good. :: I think that he should be evaluated. His test scores may not be bad, but if you show up and write some equations you will get a C. I feel like this whole semester was a waste of my time. I wish that I would have had a professor that was prepared for each class. We were way behind the syllabus then he thinks it is okay to have us read an ENTIRE chapter on our own so he can get to the next topics. I do not think this is right, I do not think that I have learned everything that the course requires. He would also put up quizzes online then email us that they are up. Sometimes by the time I would get that email the time would already be past that it was due. If people tell me that he is the teacher for this class next semester I am going to tell them that they should wait until they can take someone else. :: Thanks for a good semester. :: No. :: NIce guy, bad professor. :: No. :: The class got behind from the start which caused us to rush very quickly through important material. The instructor was also not very easy to understand in the way he presented the material. :: Make the class more fun. Make it more interactive to keep the students engaged. :: He was not very good at teaching. I think Mian should teach how Scott Thomas teaches. Do not worry too mush about the theory or derivations (we can read about those in the textbook), just go over a lot of examples all the way through. :: After doing an evaluation during the middle of the semester, it improved, but overall he is scatter-brained and does not present material in a clear manner. :: No. :: we didn't get nearly as far as we should have. grading was very fair though. :: Will attempt to never have another class with this professor again so that I can have a shot at actually learning the material. :: Do not let this man teach again. :: No. :: For the love of all that is holy, if you truly want students to ever learn anything stay as far away from a classroom as you can for the rest of your life. :: No. :: The instructor uses PowerPoint slides provided by the same people who make our textbook. This is extremely frustrating and sometimes leads me to believe that our instructor is seeing his slides for the first time the same time we are. I realize this is something teachers are allowed to do, however this style of teaching makes me wonder what role exactly the instructor plays in our education. :: Good teacher and I hope to get a good grade in the class. The final was hard though. :: Dr. Mian recorded every lecture, and put them on pilot as a reference. That was very helpful. I wish every instructor does the same. :: he is one of vaguest people I have ever met. :: This instructor is one of the best instructors because he cares about his students, and willing to improve. In summary: 1- Prepare more for lecture 2- No need to spend 2-3 weeks teaching (Statics) on a Mechanics of Materials class. 3- Solving more problems on board is always a good option. Thank you. :: no. :: No,. :: seemed like he had a crash course and then had to teach it to us. very difficult to follow. :: He utilized the online learning service. Go take a look at his lectures, and you'll see what I mean. I found absolutely no merit to go to class. :: He was a great teacher that really took the time to make sure that students understood the material. :: No. :: ... :: Room 144 in Russ is the worst classroom on campus. It needs to be completely redone. Almost half the chairs are broken and the other half aren't far behind them. :: I felt the instructor truly cared about his students learning, and I respect him for that. I felt his overall teaching style was not suited well for that class room, as he took time, multiple times each class, to raise and lower the screen to jump back and forth from the projector to hand writing on the board. His examples, even when they were straight from the book, were relatively unclear. :: Maybe easier to keep the class involved if the notes were your own and not just the book notes because everyone already has the book and can read it. :: No. :: he is a very nice guy but not the best instructor. :: Nope. :: spend less time on review material, and move the course at a faster pace, find simpler ways to convey topics you seemed to over complicate it. :: no. :: Just try to explain how to use the material a little better. Have a good holiday!"
3070,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 4150,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He is very kind professor. i would recommend to everyone to take his subjects. He teaches very well. I have take computational structural dynamics under him and this is the second subject for me. :: Very effective. :: Classes were not very beneficial to the students' understanding of the course material. Applying what we are learning to real events and real material was beneficial. Some organizational issues did make things difficult. :: Not very effective, he seemed confused by the material and there was a lot of problems with clearly following along with what he is doing. :: Poor quality teacher. :: A very fair instructor, homework and tests were tough but reasonable. :: He is very poor, I did not learn anything during his lectures.  When he would do examples in class, they were hard to follow. There was no structure/lesson plan for each day. :: Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, and explanations weren't always clear. :: 2/10. :: It was okay, the examples did help.  The book is great though. :: The material could be explained a little better. :: He's not a very good professor. He doesn't explain things well, gives homework that he doesn't know how to do and gives tests with crucial elements that have nothing to do with the course material or were never taught or gone over. Ex: we needed to use power equations on the first exam but no homework problem required them and i didn't have them on my formula sheet because there was no prior mention of them. This is not something I have memorized. :: The deliver of the material was not as effective as hoped. The material delivery was some what scattered and was not ordered in the best way. :: I am just satisfied. :: The exams in class are extremely long for the 50 minutes provided. The graduates and the undergraduates take the same exam and there is no difference between the 4000 and 6000 level course except for a few homeworks. :: The material was taught effectively. :: Effectiveness was below averaged compared to other professors. :: he was a good instructor and knew his topics well. :: Zero Effectiveness. Assigns a Project to design gears shafts and bearings and  completely skips the chapter covering shafts because he was  running behind. Tests are worthless. I had a friend get a higher score on a calculation problem on the second midterm without using any numbers or calculations. My answer was mostly correct except I carried an error I made early in the problem throughout the entire problem. He took 13 weeks to grade the first quiz. I can honestly say I learned nothing from this professor. The MME department needs to watch the recorded lectures and see for themselves. :: Absolutely terrible. He cannot teach. Anything I got from this class came from my own study time. :: Poor instructor. His lectures were not organized. Transition into topics was not clearly stated. Explanations were not clear. :: Good. :: Somewhat effective. :: good. :: The instructor was not very effective. :: Did not do well at explaining, anything. :: I give The instructor a 90% of effectiveness. :: Very effective. :: good. :: He is very good instructor and explains the material very well. :: Very good. :: Good. :: he did very well. :: unclear and disorganized at times. :: Okay. :: I feel like the instructor was not very effective in teaching the material to the class. :: Not very effective. He does not understand the material well enough to teach it. :: Very Poor. :: he was not. :: good. :: Good. :: Well organised schedule and online classes were awesome. :: Professor teached us all the concepts very well. He is more talented and tells us the correct methods that are useful in real sense for the design of mechanical elements. :: Excellent. :: Mian usually keep in class quiz and online quiz. That indirectly shows much interest to study.  He is excellent in providing material in easy manner. That helped me alot while preparin for exam. :: excellent. :: Good. :: Taught well, tried to answer questions in depth and detail.  Wish more example problems had been completed in class. :: good. :: good. :: not good."
3071,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 4150,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, i like his teaching style and the way he explains. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No, he curved because everyone did poorly because he didn't teach the material. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: 4/10. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He doesn't really grade with consistency. :: The instructor was fair. I believe I could of done better if the deliver and explanations of the material was more effective. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, for the most part. The professor aligned the course well with the textbook, notes and quizzes with a syllabus to match. :: yes he did evaluate the work as expected. :: No I have no idea how he came up with test grades. Nothing was marked and there was no consistency between different student's tests. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, The instructor did. :: Absolutely. and a fair grader. :: yes. :: yes the instructor evaluate my work based on the expectation in the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Good. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did, he is a fair grader but terrible teacher. :: No, we skipped over entire chapters that were on the syllabus. Then we were expected to used material from the skipped chapters on the assigned project. Either a grossly negligent oversight, or total incompetence. :: yes. :: yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes,he gave  assignments and quizes which helped me to grow my knowledge in course .there was a lot of improvement in me from week to week. :: Yes, he evaluates my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: ofcourse he did. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
3072,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 4150,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes ,  he came everyday on time and use the full class period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: generally. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He started class on time and used the full class period, but the time spent was not used effectively. :: Yes. :: 8/10. :: Yes, he was always on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, for the most part. :: yes he always started on time and used the full class period. :: Yes. :: Started on time and ""used"" full class period.

I was lost in most of his examples, and could not follow his logic in class. Mechanical Design 2 (NOT MACHINE DESIGN), is a simple class based on table reading and fundamental principles. I could teach it better than him. :: He would answer any questions we had. :: With teaching. :: good. :: He graded assignments. :: He wants us to learn, but he can't teach us properly. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in my learning by giving HWs related to the subject as well as the exams. In addition, the project was helpful in my learning. :: You can tell he is excited about what he teaches. :: good. :: He is very active and answer all my question in the class and he is very cooperative in the office hour. :: Good. :: Good. :: by using actual examples from the things around us and let us work on it. :: not too much. :: He did okay. :: He really didn't seem to have much interest. :: He didnt. :: He completely negated my excitement for learning about mechanical design. Craig Did an excellent job of teaching Mech Design I, and I was completely disappointed with mech design II due to the poor teaching of Dr. Mian. :: he didn't. :: very well. :: Good. :: Citing additional material and journlas related to subject. :: By giving the lectures in the design of the components of mechanical elements. :: He gave a lot of importance to student doubts .he explained those doubts clearly. :: Mian usually keep quiz and give us homework. This indirectly demonstrate interest in learning. :: friendly contact and describing the application in a practical way. :: he is good in explaining the basic concepts. :: Always willing to answer questions. :: good. :: good. :: I didn't learn too much."
3074,Akm Mian,2015 Fall,ME 4150,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well. :: Well. :: Well. :: not very well. :: Not very effectively outside of class, death by powerpoint inside. SHOW us how to do it step by step instead of just showing solutions. :: very well. :: He would send a lot of last minute emails regarding quizzes due the next day and homework due dates. :: Somewhat effectively, the project was never really explained. :: 2/10. :: Fine, he sends emails with important info that we need,. :: Could be better. :: He doesn't communicate well. :: The communication of the material was not the best. While the instructor did try he missed the mark as far as the deliver. The material could of been more effective if the basics was first explained. Then go into detail on all the necessary formulas and explain each variable or correction factor. Once this was covered examples that were explained more details would of been beneficial. :: Absolutely fine. :: 7/10. :: Good. :: he was very effective at communicating. :: Poorly. :: Do one sentence emails count?

3078,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor was very helpful in teaching SolidWorks. :: he was very kind and was more than happy to help if you needed it. :: The class showed me shorter alternatives to performing tasks in solid works. Also expanded my understanding of what is expected in engineering reports. :: Dr. Young is very cordial and interesting in class, making learning fun and memorable. He is also easy to get in contact with, for he checks e-mails and replies promptly. He expects you to listen and learn the material, but grades fairly and realistically. Learning SolidWorks from him was very effective. :: Professor Young was very effective at teaching hands on. Speaking as one of the people in the class who had never used Solidworks, I believe he made it very easy to learn by going step-by-step the first few days. :: very effective. :: Dr. Young was effective in teaching the program, SolidWorks, in an effective way. He took the time to answer questions and used a hands on approach of learning that worked sufficiently. :: This professor taught very in depth on the use and purpose of solid works and gave  the class many examples to aid in understanding and working the program. :: The instructor has a great passion for what he is teaching which makes the class very interesting. He is able to explain things thoroughly and is very reasonable with students. :: Very effective, energetic, available for questions, easy to talk to, gives descriptive explanations and examples. :: Very kind instructor!. :: Very helpful and interested in your opinion. :: High. :: Dr. Young was a very good instructor. :: Dr. Young was very good at teaching the content necessary for completing the task at hand. :: The instructor was effective because he allowed students to learn at their own pace, while giving them assistance when necessary. :: The professor was very informative and helpful with all of the topics covered in the class. :: Extremely Effective and very educational. :: Dr. Young was one of the most inspirational and astounding people I have ever met. He made every class exciting and made you feel welcomed in his classroom. His knowledge of solidworks modeling software made the class a little easier such as when something wasn't quite right or a certain measurement was out of place. He would point out any mistakes you had and give positive feedback to help on the next task or project. :: He always made sure that everybody knew how to do assignments and was available to help when needed. :: Professor Young was a very well instructor. He explained everything in detail and would take the entire class step by step though projects that we were working on. He was always open to questions if we needed them and would personally help someone if they were behind. :: He is eager to help students. During open lab he and the TAs are constantly involved in helping students with assignments. He presents the course material in an interesting fashion with practical applications. :: I learned the most in this class this semester. :: The instructor was able to effectively  guide the class through concepts through lectures and one-on-one assistance. :: He taught some stuff in Solidworks but most of it was left to us to figure out on our own. :: Dr. Young was a great teacher who helped me to understand how to do many different tasks. :: the instructor was very great, he always made sure all the students were on the same page as he was when he was teaching. :: He was very effective and I feel that I have learned a lot during this course. :: Dr. Young is a great professor, I really enjoyed his class and his teaching style. :: He's great!!!. :: Dr. Daniel Young used the class to encourage students to pursue computer aided design at home and at work. Dr. Young allowed students to publicly perform step-by-step tasks in front of the class resulting in useful public speaking/performing experience. Dr. Young also encouraged thinking outside of the box when choosing/building projects. :: Instructor was good and knew what he was doing, could have been better had the instructor used examples with numbers instead of letters (numbers is my personal prference). :: Dr.Henry was a good instructor and he did his best to make sure that we knew what to do. :: Highly Effective. :: Instructor was very effective, I learned a lot throughout the course. :: Very good at explaining concepts and applying math to real world applications. learned a lot. :: Very simple step by step instruction giver. He was a very helpful professor. :: he's a good teacher and is effective in class. :: Very effective. :: dr. young was awesome. :: The class what taught well and the way Dr. Young has the class set up is very effective(lecture then open lab). :: Dr. Young is a very knowable professor that explains the content of class very well. :: Struggled on some topics but by the end of the semester I was able to effectively show my knowledge of solidworks and build objects."
3079,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes, he and his two assistants inspected each project and judged them based on what was written in the syllabus. :: The work was graded upon the same objectives that were set out  in the first class. :: Yes. :: Yes, although I wasn't quite sure what the expectation was all the time. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor evaluated the work based on the details stated in the syllabus. :: The instructor followed the course syllabus to the dot and was very clear on how they evaluated the our work in class. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes, as well as how he felt you did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Young graded fairly and according to the syllabus. :: Yes. :: The instructor graded all of the assignments very fairly. :: Yes. :: Dr. Young followed the exact specifications he stated in the class syllabus for grading. In solidworks, we had ""design tasks"" where we would be given drawings for parts to be modeled up in solidworks, and if the part didn't meet the exact specifications, then points would be taken off accordingly. :: yes. :: Yes he evaluated our work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: Yes, as far as I could tell the syllabus was followed exactly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes the instructor evaluated my work based on the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was graded exactly how he said it would be the very first class. :: Yes!!. :: Yes, Dr. Young did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes he graded our stuff very fair. :: Yes. :: Yes he did. :: yes, we did not know which questions on test he graded, but I'm sure he graded the way he was suppose to. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. We learned all of the content listed in the syllabus. :: He grated very fairly, and made sure our work was what he asked for. :: The instructor was very fair and always made sure to communicate the expactations."
3080,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes and gave time to start design task to ask questions that we had. :: yes, he was able to manage time between his lectures and allowing students to have enough time to do as much work as they could for the class. :: The class promptly started at 6:10 and lecture lasted until 7:30. After that open lab would last the rest of the slotted time to complete the handful of projects due. :: Even though he rushed from a class he taught on the opposite side of campus, he was still on time each class and the time was spent well. :: He was pushed for time because of his class right before ours, but that was not a problem. Our class was set up in such a way that he would lecture first and then give us the rest of the class as an open laboratory. You could utilize the full class period if you wanted to. The Ta's and Professor Young were always available during open lab to answer any design questions. The length of class period depended on three things 1.) the length of the lecture, 2.)  pop quizzes, and 3.) The student. :: yes. :: The instructor attended class as soon as he possibly could. Since he had a class right before he may have run a couple minutes late. However, he always tried to start class as close to on time as possible. The professor gave a lecture for a hour and also gave open lab time for the rest of the period. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Used approximately one hour of instruction and one hour for class work. :: Yes. :: did not start on time ( but understandable, he was teaching another class and had to walk across campus to teach ours) but always used class time wisely. :: Yes. :: Yes class was started on time but we had open lad and was allowed to leave when we wanted to. :: Class was almost always started on tine, class tine was always used completely. :: Yes. :: The professor spent the class time very effectively and efficiently. :: Yes. :: The class was supposed to be from 6:10 PM-8:40 PM and he would always start right at 6:10, and sometimes a little later to allow the late students to walk in and get their items set up. Depending on what was due that day or week, Dr. Young would explain the project in detail to convey to the students what was needed from them. If nothing big was due, then a short, interesting lecture would take place and the rest of the time would be given to the students as ""open lab"". :: yes. :: Yes he always started the class on time but if he finished his lecture early we had open lab and people were welcome to stay or leave the lab. :: Yes, sometimes he was a couple minutes late but he had to rush from another class. The entire class period was not used to lecture, rather it always ended with open lab, as designed for this class. :: the instructor would use the first hour of class to lecture and leave the rest of class time for students to work on projects while he and his TA's were available for questions until class ended. :: Class was started on time. Any class time the instructor didn't use was deemed open lab. :: The instructor would be late either getting to class or getting started in class and most of class was free time to do our projects that were due almost every week. :: Yes. :: yes he was always on time and made sure we used the full time sometimes went over a little to teach more. :: Yes. :: Dr. Young always started class on time and he used the first hour to hour and a half on lecture and teaching us solid works and the rest of the time was open lab. While this may seem like he gave more open lab than actual teaching, it is actually very effective because some students (like me) don't have solid works on there own computer, also this open lab time allows the students to work with the addition of being able to ask for help if they get stuck. So overall I would say that Dr. Young did use the whole class period. :: Yes. :: Dr. Young usually started on time but did not use the full class period for lecture. Time was allotted for students to work on computer aided design projects each class period. :: yes. :: He did you the whole class time and we started as soon as he got to the class. :: Yes, however the final portion of the class was optional, although the instructor stayed for this entire time. :: Yes, class was slightly different with an hour of lecture and then open lab, but he was always there to field questions throughout the entire period. :: yes every single class was started right on time and went for the entire deration. :: He was a minute or so late every day but it's because his schedule,  not his negligence. He was routine and proficient with the way his time was spent. :: he started on time but gave us open lab after his lecture for the rest of class. :: Would start on time, but the only half of class period was needed. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he started class on time and used the class time for lecture and open lab. During open lab, the students could leave if they wanted to be it was not recommended.He stayed until the end of class every time. :: Class was started on time and was never longer than it need to be. Good balance of instruction and lab time."
3081,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he was always willing to help me with even the simplest of questions like locations and confirming if i was doing anything right or not. :: Routinely would ask of my background in engineering and see if he could help further my knowledge. :: Dr. Young demonstrated interest in my learning by answering questions promptly and thoroughly, making sure the answer was understood. He is easily contactable and friendly. :: He always seemed really excited about what he was talking about, especially when he answered questions. :: Was very helpful. :: The instructor answered any questions asked and helped with solving problems that I faced with the SolidWorks program. :: The gave us open ab time after every lecture so that they could walk around the entire room and help every student as they asked questions to ensure the student was successful. :: The professor would always be willing to go out of his way for a student if they had a question or needed something for class. He cared about how the students were doing in the class. :: Showed an energetic and enthusiastic attitude everyday. :: Very well. :: he was very encouraging with what ideas i had and how to improve them. :: Was very available for questions and willing to help with any issues. :: I've always been interested in enginnering and really liked the hands on par of the class. :: Dr. Young was always available for questions and was a way willing to help. :: He gave us meaningful projects that always had real world relevance. In this class, the focus was not on grades, it was on learning. :: The instructor always helped with one-on-one questions very well. :: He takes the time to listen to your questions and individually answer. He would also individually walk you through things on Solidworks if you were really struggling with a concept. :: Dr. Young would always go at every project from many different angles to make sure all students understood the task at hand, and sometimes did a demonstration on harder projects so the students would know how to get started, or even do the project the correct way. :: He was always there to help us and give us his opinion on our projects. :: By going step by step to make sure that everyone had learned the program or the tool that we were learning that day. :: He tried to show the real life application of what we were using and how it was important in mechanical engineering. :: I was compelled to learn Solidworks and Dr. Young demonstrated some very interesting features while teaching a majority of the class the program when most students had no prior knowledge of Solidworks. :: Not really, he was just like here's this do it and turn it in when I say so. :: By always being available to help you with any work you were doing. :: showing us things that helped us and by not boring us at the sametime. :: Routinely patrolled rooming seeking to help student, including myself. :: Every lecture he would have a different student come to the front and do the lecture on the screen in front of everyone. Also during open lab he always walked around in case someone needed help or give students tips. :: He showed us how to use Solidworks which is really interesting. :: Dr. Young showed interest in my learning by introducing new features and techniques for building objects in SolidWorks 2015-2016. This interest was also shown when Dr. Young listened to students share new techniques or features in SolidWorks with him or other students. :: answered questions and made sure everybody understood the material. :: He made everything fun and made us pay attention by doing things and making the tasks interesting. :: By providing opportunities to demonstrate your skills acquired in front of the class. :: By doing live demonstrations. :: if we weren't paying attention he would point us out to the whole class. :: He was interested in what he taught. :: he helped me when i needed help. :: Would come around and talk to each student individually if they needed individual help. :: by always running around the class full speed during open lab to answer every ones questions. :: Thoroughly answered questions. Allowed the final project to be an idea of the students' choice. :: He would make the class fun. He would show us the cool stuff we will be able to create. :: Answered every questions and even help out when I would not ask a question. Always made sure everyone was on the same page."
3082,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor was easy to get a hold of in and out of the classroom. :: he was easy to understand when explaining things. only once was i confused about something, but when i asked about it he was able to explain it to me easily. :: He communicated very well in and out of class. :: Again, the instructor is a very good communicator and easily contactable through e-mail. :: He was very great at communicating ways to fix problems in person and via email. He always responded to his email quickly and cleared up questions very simply. :: very effectively. :: The instructor was very effective with communication in class but out of class he did not always respond to emails sent to him. :: The instructor was very effective on communication of information both in and outside the classroom. :: The professor communicated very well. There was never a time when I was confused what was happening in class. The daily agenda helped out with the schedule for class. :: Communicated well. :: Very well. :: very well. :: Used pilot effectively to provide a schedule for projects. Provided useful lectures. :: In the classroom really well. Not much need for out of the room contact. :: Dr. Young communicated very well in class he also responded to emails in a quick and reasonable time. :: Very well. :: The professor posted each class agenda so we always knew what was expected. :: Very he was clear in class and always reminding the class of due dates and expectations. He would send out emails for reminders on big projects or schedule changes. :: In the classroom, Dr. Young and his teaching aides would always answer any question from any student no matter what time of class it was. They would stop what they were doing to answer the question to the best of their knowledge. However I cannot speak on behalf of outside of the classroom because I never attempted to make outside contact with him, because such good communication was displayed in the classroom. :: He would quickly respond to emails asking about projects and was always there to help in class when needed. :: I had never gone to his office hours but in class he always welcomed questions and would talk if needed. :: Very well, never had any problems. Often information was stated multiple times for clarification. :: he always identified important dates and student responsibilities. :: Well. :: I never knew anything till the class before it was due. He never gave dates that were known more than the class before beside the final design project. :: always communicate with the students like I said making sure we were on the same page. :: Incredibly. His emails were always very helpful and replies were received quickly. :: He is great at communicating with his students. Every class period he would start by going over things that were due and what time the drop box on pilot closed. So I always knew the due date of the design tasks. :: He was really effective both in and out of classroom. :: Dr. Young used all methods of communication effectively to answer questions in and outside of the classroom. My questions were answered in a concise manner within a reasonable period of time. :: the instructor communicated well. :: He communicated very well inside the class but I did not see him outside of class. :: Highly effectively. :: Very well. :: very effectively. he was always open to extra questions after class and during office hours. :: There wasn't much information on pilot so it was hard to know exactly what was going on in the class if you didn't hear him say it is class. In class he always made time to go over the schedule. :: very well. :: very well. :: Well. Answered questions in class and during office hours, and responded to emails in a timely manner. :: He has very helpful if asked for help. He communicated everything very clearly and effectively. :: Always got emails back from him and made sure to answer each question."
3083,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yeas. :: yes, despite the complexity of the course's program, solid works, he was able to explain it in a way that allowed me to become familiar with the program rather quickly. :: The lectures were structured to understand tools needed to complete design tasks. :: There was a ""class agenda"" that was meticulously followed for each class, which was very well organized. :: I thought so. There might be room for improvement on organizing the due dates for the class and having it posted on one sheet instead of a class agenda slide every week. (To clarify, the class agenda slide every week was very useful--keep it!). :: yes. :: The lectures were decently organized but sometimes there was some confusion on what was expected for certain projects. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Very organized. Could be more of a schedule on Pilot. :: Yes?. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Content in class always follow the agenda set up for that day. :: Yes. :: All of the lectures were very inclusive and explanatory. :: Yes. :: On Pilot, Dr. Young would update grades daily and before the class started, he would update what was due that week and send out emails or pilot notifications stating what was due. He also had a tab on pilot for lecture files, so the students could follow along on the computer or just listen to the lecture and perhaps take notes. The same thing was for every project that we had to do, which included a grading rubric so the student knew how he or she was being graded. :: yes. :: Yes the course content and lectures were well organized. We always new due dates for projects because he would put them on the board before beginning his lecture. :: Yes, it seemed to follow a logical progression throughout the class. :: yes, very well. :: yes. :: The course content and lectures were actually well organized. :: very organized and was listed in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, it is clear that Dr. Young has experience in teaching this course and knows the best way to teach it. He always had a plan for the lectures. :: Yes, he organized it really well. :: Despite the three week delay, Dr. Young focused on exposing students to as much practical information as possible. The content and lectures expanded upon the content learned in the previous class period. :: yes. :: Yes you knew when everything was supposed to be turned in and we turned everything in on the dates the tasks were due. :: Yes. :: Yes they were. :: yes, every class had a set plan of material to cover. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, In pilot. :: yes. :: Yes. The lectures applied to the tasks we were working on and provided a wide range of knowledge in regards to the program, engineering drawings, etc. :: Yes. He has a schedule he follows perfectly. :: Yes because each class built on to the knowledge we previously knew."
3084,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yeas. :: i can't really answer that since i had no real need for his office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was! See previous answer. :: yes. :: I never attended the professors professor's office hours; however, the lab times held by the TAs were extremely helpful and effective. :: Yes. Whenever I had a question to ask in class or outside he was very quick to respond with the best answer possible. :: yes. :: Reasonably available. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Office hours were always post, however I personally never went to office hours. :: Yes. :: Always, he quickly responded to my emails. :: I cannot say because I never made my way to office hours because communication was excellent in the classroom, however on the syllabus it was stated that anyone could stop in to office hours with any questions and he would use his ability to best answer it. :: yes. :: Yes the instructor was reasonably available and responsive to our needs during office hours and appointment. :: I never went to office hours or any appointments outside of class. :: yup. :: yes. :: Yes when I needed him he was always an email away. :: yes he always had time for us. :: Yes. :: Yes, I never had a problem getting a hold of him or meeting with him outside of class. :: Yes, I sent him a message over the weekend and he replied right away. :: Yes, Dr. Young was available and responsive to any requests/questions whether by email or appointment. :: yes. :: Yes he had TA's that helped us during their office hours because he had another class that he had to take care of. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes, he responded to email very quickly and always showed interest in helping outside of class. :: Never met him in office hours. :: Yes, reasonable office hours. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, if you needed him and you asked for him, he would try to meet with you. :: Yes. Always answered emails."
3085,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I think teaching how to use the software could be emphasized more. :: not at the moment. :: Great instructor!. :: I would recommend this instructor to incoming freshman and take his courses in the future. :: I felt like we feel behind because we were unable to use solid works the first few weeks of class, and that is why we did not have as much time to do our final project, so ignore this comment if that was the reason we did not have much time, but I think more time should be given for the final project!  Overall, great course and great instructor!. :: no. :: No. :: no. :: No problems following along in class of communicating. :: Thank you for trying! I apologize for never being in class. I am just not an Engineer and will be switching majors. I think you are a wonderful professor and are very kind and accommodating! Thank you!. :: Fun and interesting class. Dr. Young is very helpful and personable. :: no. :: This instructor was very helpful, was a fair grader, and was willing to answer any student's questions. :: Great professor, learned a lot from him and made this one of my favorite classes. :: Dr. Young made my first semester of college very like able and doable. He is a great professor and takes his job very seriously, no bad comments at all on Dr. Young. :: Very good, engaging, and fun teacher. :: The instructor should let it be known well before when the assignments are due and should consider doing things in a different order so it's not so repetitive. :: just that the instructor was very great and would take a class taught by him again. :: No. :: Dr. young is a great professor!!. :: This class was provided practical knowledge and experience to students in a manner that understands the workload of full time students. :: He was a good instructor and his TA's related to us and were really cool and very helpful. :: no. :: He was a great professor, would recommend him to anyone. :: There could be rubrics for the projects that are more clarifying, it was hard to know exactly what was needed for the reports most of the time. :: nope. :: awesome class fun and dr young did an excellent job making the class fun and giving ereyone an opportunity to prove themsleves. :: I feel that the design task with the coffee cup and wrench should have been assigned a little later in the course. Not having experience with SolidWorks prior to this class, I wasn't familiar enough with the appropriate tools and had to have help during class/office hours for almost the entirety of the project. :: Great instructor. Hope to have him in other classes. :: Great professor and should give small quizzes on the functions of solidworks and other engineering info frequently."
3086,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Young was an effective instructor. He understood the material and was able to explain it well. :: Dr. Young seems to really enjoy the subject he teaches and passes that on to his students. He answered questions quickly and thoroughly whether they be asked in class, through email, or in office hours. He was the best at taking somewhat complicated subject matter and breaking it down to be more intuitive. :: good. :: He was amazing within lectures. He made learning the material interesting. :: I felt as if he did a fair job; not bad but not spectacular either. I had taken a Thermodynamics class in the past so much of what we went over for the beginning of the semester I had already at least seen before. But once we started to get into new material I had to learn most of the material of my own because his in-class notes didn't really help, at least for me anyway. :: He is knowledgeable but needs more organization. :: Explained concepts very well. :: Informative, yet can get off topic. :: Very effective, great in class explanations of planned lecture material and very thorough when answering questions. :: Very effective. Had a clear plan for class learning and slowed down through tough portions of the curriculum to allow class to understand. :: One of the  best at lecturing I have ever had. Could give more useful homework problems."
3087,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, Dr. Young evaluated our work according to the expectations in his syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Exams and homework assignments graded very fairly, notes on mistakes and places to review given for feedback. :: Yes. :: absolutely"
3088,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Dr. Young occasionally would have difficulties with tardiness, but he would use the full class period. Unfortunately, since he had to teach another class across campus scheduled for ten minutes after the end of our class, he wasn't really available for questions after class. If he did stay, he would be late to his other class. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: No, but this was understandable given his schedule. He still covered all the material. :: Yes, unless people were butts and were late he always started on time and went till the end. :: He was a few minutes late sometimes. :: Class time was used to its fullest. :: Within a five-minute window, yes. I understand his schedule was very full this semester. :: few minutes late. not a problem"
3089,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- You can tell that Dr. Young really enjoys the subject by the way he teaches it to his students. He is always excited to explain it to us and is bursting with energy. He is usually bouncing around the front of the room as he talks. :: He made himself available for questions and concerns. He postponed an exam for a less than confident class and everyone was better off for it. :: Yes. :: He did a good job at making sure we understood the topic we were covering before moving on. He might have to go over two or three times, but he did his best to make sure we understood it as well as possible. :: By always letting us ask questions and kept us involved in class. :: Carrying on from ME 2700. :: Very helpful in office hours and any other times outside of class in addition to handling questions very well during lecture. Made a point to increasing understanding of concepts, not just plug and chug mathematics. :: Tailored time spent on material to prepare for later classes that require thermodynamic concepts. Adequately available for explanations outside of class. :: frequently asks class if we understand something. open to questions"
3090,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Young communicated very effectively both in and out of the classroom. :: He communicated well. :: 7.5/10. :: Very quickly. :: In the classroom I would say he did a pretty good job.I didn't need to communicate with him very often outside the classroom but when I did he was quick to respond. :: Very well, always available to consult with and explained concepts well. :: Answered every question asked very well and showed great attention to detail so as to not give an oversimplified or otherwise incorrect answer. :: Very enthusiastically. Some mincing of words here and there, but that's to be expected. :: very"
3091,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- I would have liked to have had more time to discuss the calculation of phase diagrams. (We only got to the formation of phase diagrams during the last class session.) I'm not sure what other subject should have been truncated in order to allow more time for this section, but I was slightly disappointed because I am really interested in phase diagrams and I know that they are extremely important to Materials Engineers. Maybe a slightly longer class time would have been beneficial for this class, in order to ensure complete discussion of all the topics in Thermodynamics of Materials. :: May need to structure classes a little more. We would often go off on tangents for long periods of time and miss some more important information. :: 7.5/10. :: Yes. :: This would be my biggest problem with the class; his lectures could have been much more well organized. At times, his notes would be all over the place and it would be hard to follow along with what he was doing. The course consisted of drawing and redrawing a lot of phase diagrams, graphs, or processes going from some state 1 to state 2. Rather than draw an entirely new graph/diagram he would just keep adding on to the one he had already drawn or just wipe something off with his hand or eraser real quick. That's great if you're working on a whiteboard, but it makes it difficult if you're working with pencil and paper because things get cluttered up really fast. :: It was adequately organized. :: The lectures and content could have been organized a little better. :: Yes. :: Very well organized; course felt a little faster paced near the end but nothing was left out and still had time for questions and review. :: Generally, yes. Some issues with notes that he had to correct on the fly. :: as well as a thermo class can be"
3092,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Dr. Young is ALWAYS willing to help out with any questions students have. This is something really great about him as a teacher. He never belittles students, no matter the question, and if he doesn't know the answer right away (which isn't often) he researches the answer as soon as he can and gets back to students promptly. :: Yes, easy to get a hold of. :: yes. :: Yes. :: I didn't really need to meet with him throughout the semester so I can't speak to how responsive he is to his students' needs during office hours. However, he did promptly return any e-mails that I sent to him. :: Yes, always. :: Yes. :: Very open, available, and helpful. Would answer any questions when free to, not just inside office hours or lecture. :: Yes, see above. :: yes. responded quickly"
3093,Henry Young,2015 Fall,ME 3750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- It is really encouraging to see a professor so invested in student learning and understanding. Dr. Young is definitely one of the best Materials Science and Engineering professors at Wright State. I only wish he would be teaching more of the advanced classes in my major, especially Diffusion and Kinetics. :: I understand Dr. Young's reasoning for not using examples in class but he needs to find a compromise between a class full of problem examples and a class with none at all. :: He is a great professor and one of the best within the material science department!. :: Overall it was just an okay class. My biggest critique would be the organization of the in-class lectures. It was hard to follow exactly what he was doing on the board sometimes because he was kind of all over the place and his notes/lectures were messy. We had to draw a lot of graphs and it was hard to keep up and follow along with him at times. You could either just listen to him and try to understand conceptually what he was saying, or just focus on recreating what he was drawing on the whiteboard in your notes but not really focus in on what he was saying. You couldn't really do both. Since the class consisted of making so many graphs/diagrams you would go back and look at your notes and see everything you had drawn but wouldn't have any notes to go along with them. Sure, it's  great to have a lot of graphs but if you don't know what they tell you they're useless.  If he organized his notes a little better it would be a much better course. Rather than perhaps just deliver his lecture on the whiteboard, pass out some worksheets beforehand that already have the graphs and figures that you're covering that day with space for notes. This way students can focus more on interpreting the graph and taking notes on what information you can get from it and what he is telling you about them, rather than spending a lot of time trying to make them look right. :: I really enjoyed having Dr. Young teach this course and have a much better understanding of thermodynamics because of him. :: Well done. I feel like this class was well worth it and effective. :: no"
3094,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was good. :: I enjoyed real lectures as opposed to the new teaching style. The professor worked hard to get students to learn the material. :: This instructor was not effective.  His teaching style was not conducive to learning, as students discussed topics with little to no input from the professor.  The professor was in the process of writing a text book, and it was still in the very rough stages.  There were little to no examples, and in many cases, he was trying to finish writing the chapter as we discussing the material. :: very good. :: concepts were explained well wherever the questions arised."
3095,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: No.  The instructor immediately got off the schedule listed in the syllabus.  The syllabus listed the class grade was going to be based on several quizzes and a group project.  Instead, there was no group project and he gave a take home final.  There was no direction, and when asked for more direction, he commented that it didn't matter because he ""would be very lenient with the grades."". :: Yes. :: yes"
3096,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: The class was not directed by the instructor, but the class typically started around class time.  Several classes the prof did not say a word, and the class just sat in silence, reading material. :: Yes. :: yes"
3097,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He would always answer all questions that were brought up. :: See 1. :: I did not see evidence that the instructor had interest in my learning. In fact, on the last day of class, we had a test where he asked questions like nothing we had seen before.  We took the test individually and then as a class.  After discussing my questions for a while, as the prof sat in the corner saying nothing. Once class was over, he commented that we missing key points.  He missed a value teaching moment, as we (the class) did not learn what are mistakes were. Also, several times people in class asked if we could have a lecture instead of student led discussion.  He never wanted to lecture. :: very good. :: The whole concept of classroom learning took a different level with the introduction of annotations. Since it was a very concept the instructor did keep pushing all of us to annotate which did help everyone"
3098,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good. :: Email was the best form of communications. Sometimes sent last minute but usually due to unusual circumstances. :: The professor did not communicate at all. :: very good. :: Good
3099,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- There weren't really any lectures. :: First time with this style, so not too organized but the attempt was made and will progress into something easily by next semester. :: No.  The layout was ill-thought out, and there were no lectures. :: yes. :: yes"
3100,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: The instructor was not responsive online or in-class. Despite having taught this class for a number of years, he seemed unprepared. :: yes. :: yes"
3101,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4770,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I didn't really like how there wasn't really any lectures. I felt like the way the class was set up we were kind of supposed to teach ourselves with only the book as a reference. I wish that there would have been more lectures so he could go over example problems that were similar to the homework. :: Not a huge fan of this teaching/learning style. :: I would not recommend this class or this professor.  I was sorely disappointed in the class. :: no. :: Since it is a very new concept, it will take much more time for the students to adapt to it and get familiarized. So lecturing some important concepts right away instead of reading them will help and this was done during the later part of the semester which turned out to be quite helpful."
3102,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: He is terrible and gives no help what so ever.  All he is looking to do is bash our group and tell us what we are doing wrong instead of telling us what we can do right to fix the situation.  He didn't even finish grading our proposal and said it was hard to look at and didn't even finish reading it. :: Would be much more beneficial for Senior Design Projects to have less classes. Much of the material covered by lectures and guest speakers were things that would have been beneficial freshman year, and those who are persistent in engineering have knowledge of all this material. :: Great instructor, nice guy. :: Knowledgeable and helpful, but forgets things said previously in class. :: Good intentions but class was very unorganized and not structured well. :: he is great and i think all his comments are reasonable. :: Very unorganized. Never made clear what the expectations were, or they were changed before an assignment was turned in. :: Did not learn much from him, Dr. Roberts did most of the lecturing. :: He was a very good instructor and very nice, helpful. :: i don't know. :: Instructor was not clear about requirements of course submissions. The various assignments due were not well defined and not clear what was expected. :: great teacher. :: Not a bad instructor, knowledgeable on materials. Some of the lectures are pointless. The lecture on Microsoft Word should not have happened. We are seniors, if we have not learn how to use Word by now we shouldn't be engineers. Most of the lectures are not beneficial and take up time that could be used on the projects. Also attendance should not be taken for a grade in college, especially in a senior capstone class. :: good. :: Good Professor. :: good. :: he was very good DR. :: Very good and helpful. :: very good"
3103,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- good. :: Nope didn't do anything because classes were combined so Roberts did everything, but it was fine by me because Srinivasan probably wouldn't have done much anyway.  Changes things that are due even though he said they were due a different day.  Very unorganized I think. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Don't have grades yet but so far, the class has been a waste of time, haven't learned a thing waking up at 8 am to learn Microsoft Word. :: yes he did. :: Yes. The syllabus was followed pretty closely. :: There were no explicit expectations given. Notebook grades were given based on no rubric, it was very subjective and extremely inconsistent. There were many comments in the feedback for the papers that were not discussed beforehand, online, or during lecture. :: Yes, he gave us a lot of feedback and tried to help us do our best work. :: not good enough. :: The expectations of the course were not even outlined. Cannot make this assessment. :: yes. :: No. The feedback was not clear. We did not receive a graded rubric back. There was no standard for notebook grading. :: yes. :: Fair enough. :: yes. :: YES. :: Yes."
3104,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- good. :: Showed up right at class time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yeah. :: yes. :: Typically started on time and ended early. :: Mostly. :: Yes. :: i don't know. :: Class started on time usually. :: yes. :: Came late several times, ever though we had to sign in for attendance. So we couldn't sign in until he arrived. If professors claim that attendance taking teaches professionalism then they should arrive on time every class. He did use the full class period though. :: yes. :: Yes Great Time management. :: yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes"
3105,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- good. :: Hasn't interested me in anything because he always shoots our ideas down. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He had us do a presentation which was helpful for our learning, and he gave us lots of feedback to help us prepare. :: i don't know. :: great teacher. :: Asked questions about our project. However he focused on instructing us on things that were mostly irrelevant to our project. :: very well. :: Not really because he knows more about the material science instead. :: good. :: YES. :: Very good."
3106,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- good. :: Held meetings every other week and they were unproductive because he thinks we haven't got anything done. :: The class was very unorganized because of having two instructors for the first 75% of the semester. Hard to know when to compete assignments because of this. :: Great. :: He forgot some things but overall questions were answered. :: Not very effective, waste of time in class for the most part. :: He often would forget to tell us something in class, and then would have to email us. Or, we would have to ask him later because he forgot to tell us in class. It was very unorganized and a lot of times we had no idea what we were supposed to be doing for our assignments unless we asked them in class. :: Outside of the classroom he gave inconsistent responses. I think the joint lecturing with multiple sections made it more difficult for each prof to give a definite answer when the other prof may have said something else. :: Very well. :: i don't know. :: yes. :: was so good with everyone. :: Very bad on emails, never responded. :: good. :: YES. :: Very clear. :: very good"
3107,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- good. :: yes. :: Nope. :: A lot of the content in the lecture was common sense and was very boring. Most of the class would just do their own thing in lecture. The guest lectures provided good information. A lot of the stuff covered in class could be done in 3 lectures total. The first or second should be only about how to write a notebook properly. I feel like the lectures needed better material, and possible get the teams more involved with the lectures. :: No. :: Most of the time the lectures were guest lecturers that were a waste of our time. Group meetings were somewhat helpful. :: sometimes. :: Yes, although sometimes it seemed a little disorganized and expectations were unclear. Guest speakers were not always very interesting. :: i don't know. :: No, most of the lectures were pointless and waste of time. :: yes. :: No, not organized at all. The lecture were pointless most of the time, and the schedule was changed so often it was hard to know what was going on day to day. The same goes for assignments. Pilot was incorrect most of the time. :: yes. :: Some how yes. :: yes. :: YES. :: Yes. :: yes"
3108,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- good. :: Hardly met with him because he just told our group to talk to other people because he couldn't help us. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was available outside of class to ask questions. :: Was available and responded accordingly. :: Yes. :: i don't know. :: yes. :: Responded quickly but sometimes did answer the questions, which shows he didn't fully read the email. :: yes. :: Not much but OK. :: yes. :: YES IN BOTH. :: Yes. :: yes"
3109,Raghavan Srinivasan,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- good. :: WOULD NEVER TAKE!!. :: nope. :: Write down notes of things mentioned in class or questions after class so you can remember without a doubt what was said. :: no. :: Although there was a lot of guidance in the senior design project, I feel like expectations could have been more clear sometimes. :: i don't know. :: Class should not be held as often as it was. Biggest disappointment with this course was regularly meeting about things not relevant to project. Course wastes students time especially when it could be spent on the actual project. Should have only met 5-6 times throughout semester in my opinion. :: no. :: no. :: NO. :: No. :: no"
3110,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 3320,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very good instructor for the course. His knowledge of Thermodynamics and work experience with thermodynamic cycles has really made him an excellent instructor for the course. Since he has taught this course in the past, he was well prepared for teaching the material to a new set of students. :: The instructor was very effective in making the topics interesting. :: Very organized and clear. Did an excellent job of utilizing pilot and the technology available to give students every opportunity to learn. Periodic quizzes made students understand material throughout semester and not have to cram for exams. :: Aided in learning of material.  Good balance of theory and examples to understand real world applications.  Made sure we had all resources that we could possibly need to learn material. :: Very Effective. Good communication and good examples. :: Dr. Roberts is a very energetic and effective instructor.  He manages to make the subject matter interesting even during plain note taking. :: Dr. Roberts was very easy to understand and provided great explanation of content. :: The instructor gave many useful examples and took time explaining himself. :: Dr. Roberts is a good professor. He is very fair when it comes to exams and grading and makes his expectations clear. Some of his examples could be clearer, but overall his teaching is effective. :: effective. :: This instructor was greatly effective. :: Dr. Roberts is very knowledgeable and knows how to convey information in an effective manner. :: Decently effective. Taught the material needed for exams. :: great. :: Very helpful. Learn a lot from lectures. :: Effective made good use of class resources, interesting teacher for the course. :: Great! Everything was clearly explained and made sense. :: Well-balanced in grading and challenging students with course material without throwing too many curve balls. :: Good, it seemed like you hadn't reviewed the subject in a while during some of the lectures, but other than that it was a pretty enjoyable experience. :: I feel that he taught the tested the right concepts. :: Good. :: He made me interested to learn more every week during in the semester. :: Very effective. :: Definatly one of my favorite teachers up to this point in my academic career. Dr Roberts makes this class applicable and interesting."
3111,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 3320,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, especially when it came down to homework and our exams. The material that we were tested over required much thought, and all was graded well with reasoning behind why grades were assigned. :: Yes. :: Yes. Went directly by the syllabus. It was very cleat what was expected of the students. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, any variances from the syllabus were documented and had advance notice. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Everything was outlined in the syllabus and stayed the same throughout the semester.

He is a fair grader and does an excellent job making sure the content is understood and that the level of understanding is reflected in the grade."
3112,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 3320,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, the instructor never had a late day. That, and he placed all of his lectures online after they had taken place. :: Yes. :: Yes. Never late, never finished early. :: yes.  Very punctual, good at using full class time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the professor used time efficiently and effectively. :: Yes. We always started on time and typically took the whole hour and twenty minute class period. :: yes. :: Class was always started on time, and the full period used,. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yea and only on quiz days. :: Yes, big time. :: Yes, always on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. He made good use of time and came to class prepared."
3113,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 3320,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He continually asked if we wanted to know how anything worked thermodynamically, as well as what may or may not interest us about the material that we did cover. :: By working examples thoroughly. :: Always asked for questions, wanted to be sure things were clear before moving on. :: Made himself available for help outside of class. :: Dr. Roberts showed concern the first few weeks when I did not have a textbook. :: Very much. :: He did this by asking if anyone had questions and offering all lectures and notes on pilot. :: He is very excited about teaching thermodynamics which helps make the students want to learn too. :: Asked us questions. :: He gave real world examples and was enthusiastic. :: Dr. Roberts seemed to make an attempt to relate our class topics to real world projects that he has experienced. This appeared to be his method of showing us the importance of the material at hand. :: Not very much. Sat at the desk and wrote on his iPad during the entire class. Could rarely get class involved. :: Cordial, if strictly professional. :: Very much so. :: He always answered every question I asked. :: 12345. :: 100% Yes. :: Brought in own experiences to show how topics relate to the real world. :: Dr Roberts made what was to be learned and why it was being learned clear."

Dr. Roberts did a good job of making this transition less painful. :: Very uninteresting lectures, didn't teach enough material to entirely solve homework problems. :: no. :: No. :: Very easy-going demeanor helped make class more fun & interesting. :: A strong suggestion for improvement would be to offer additional coaching and instruction in how to use the EES software. :: Some of the homework questions seemed harder just because they weren't exactly over things we had discussed in depth in class. :: no. :: He is really motivated and talented in the Thermodynamics. :: No. :: No."
3118,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He was very helpful in giving us ideas and telling us what was expected of us for our senior project.  Helped us rewrite papers to make them better. :: Good presenter. :: ok

Great guy. :: Dr. Roberts was fair and helpful through all phases of this course. :: sufficient. :: Dr. Roberts was always interested and engaged when we met with him. Feedback was always clear and effective. :: 10/10. :: The instructor was moderately to very effective.  The course itself was not that effective. :: Dr. Roberts is able to inform the class on proper communication techniques due to his experience within the research community. He is very knowledgeable over the topics he covers and effective in teaching the information. :: He is the best ever teaching . :: Dr. Roberts has planned the course perfectly. As an international student, the idea of Capstone is highly praised and therefore executing the course work with the help of our advisor Dr. Mian and very well devised lectures by Dr. Roberts and Dr. Srinivasan. :: Good. :: Good instructor. :: Not every effective at all. Provided a lot of confusion and unclear instructions and deadlines. :: Dr. Roberts was effective in communicating the necessary information to the class. :: I like Rory but the class don't teach us anything!. :: He's not too bad. The schedule of this course was well defined. However, he did not supply us with enough information to complete most of the assignments which resulted in some F's and low grades. He gave us second chances to redo our work. His feedback was the only helpful thing to finish an assignment. It would've been a lot more helpful and efficient if he gave us the information in the feedback of what he truly wants before turning the assignment in. He needs to give better and more details about what he expects from us for each assignment."

So some lower grades were given that I did not think were fair based upon what was expected in the syllabus. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes the evaluations are most reasonable. However, since my team lacked the number of students required in a group for this project, certain expectations were very difficult to meet. Examples would be: absence of either one of the group members results in an individual presentation. :: Yes. :: Not necessarily. This course is very poorly laid out and the specific responsibilities aren't well-defined. :: The syllabus was lacking in explanations of what was expected of students. Grader of notebooks provided very arbitrary grades that were inconsistent. :: Yes, the syllabus gave a detailed setup of the class work and requirements. :: yes. :: There were no well-defined expectations.

The group meetings were very helpful inside of class effective. :: Ok. :: Dr. Roberts was clear in his discussions and made the classwork efficient. :: Communication was sub-par, but it was getting better towards the end. :: Writing assignments were somewhat vague, especially in the beginning of the semester. Questions were answered well, and lectures were clear to understand. :: 10/10. :: Communication was good. :: very well. :: very goodyes. :: Very effectively, because we had group meetings sorted in time frames for each professor with each group.

Mostly just the classes fault not Roberts. :: Yes, but I would have liked to have more engineers from industry come in to talk with us. :: I would like to hear more from practicing engineers. :: Yes, except it was sometimes difficult to find criteria for writing assignments. :: 7/10. :: Course needs to be better organized.  Seemed like items that were due were not brought to the students attention until someone asked about the,. :: overall I feel that the course was not properly organized, there were many topics (mainly over how to properly write a proposal) that were not covered in time or at all. It would be more beneficial for students to have an in-depth coverage of the proposal contents as opposed to just having a rubric online. :: yes. :: Yes the course content was well organized and it was easy to navigate between different sources and documents. :: Some of the lectures were not that relevant and the time could of been used for more beneficial items possible. :: I guess so. :: Not at all. Lectures did not outline what was expected of students, and guest lecturers provided redundant information and were involved in the grading process when they shouldn't have been. Most lectures felt like wasted class time that could have been given in 15 minutes instead of 80 minutes. :: Lectures were organized and planned well, and followed the syllabus well. :: no. :: Not really. The lectures did not have any connections. Also, there was a lecture about Microsoft Word towards the end/middle of the semester which should've been one of the first few lectures."
3132,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yup. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, communicating with Dr. Roberts was always easy to do. :: yes. :: Yes. :: 8/10. :: He was available. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. Although this is true, the team did not really require any other appointments with the professors because every task was well defined and necessary communications were made when required and on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, but did not offer clear advice. :: Yes. :: kinda. :: Yes."
3133,Rory Roberts,2015 Fall,ME 4910,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- This course can NOT be at 8 Am in the morning . the lecture is just talking . know one will have the mood to talk and participate at 8 in the morning !! even the gusts of the classes were not happy with the laziness of the student at 8 am. Just put it on the afternoon. :: Overall, Dr. Roberts was a fantastic instructor to have for capstone, his suggests during team meetings was extremely helpful.  Overall, I feel he is invested in our success and I am excited to have the same experience for capstone 2 and wish I had more classes with him.  My only criticism is there were some days where it felt as though they were searching for material to lecture on, this was generally a waste of time to even hold a class. :: no. :: Nope. :: no. :: none. :: no. :: Very good overall, I look forward to having Dr. Roberts again in the Spring. :: good instructor but I felt that the lecture part was unnecessary and would be better as a freshman level course to help introduce freshmen to the engineering process. :: no. :: no. :: no thanks. :: This course itself is very frustrating. Responsibilities aren't well-defined. We have a small amount of time to work on our project and spend a large amount of energy balancing between proposing work while currently working on said work. It is bizarre to think that we have time to finish our projects while attempting to do research that would normally be done before a bid for work. I'm not bidding for work and we already have experience writing proposals, from EGR3350, so why is it necessary to make me work on a load of research paper material for a project that has a short, already occurring, timeline. I think this Capstone Design class is very unorganized and, in effect, chaotic. :: Course felt completely unorganized and class time was wasted. Requirements for assignments were not clearly defined, and deadlines were rarely announced. :: Many of the guest lectures and activities seemed pointless and/or below our education level. Particularly the English-oriented lectures by Alysoun Taylor-Hall, as well as the Paper Helicopter experiment. :: no. :: No."

He starts the class with questions from the previous lecture so we refresh our memory he discuss with us the online quizzes and the statistics so he can make sure that the majority of the class is doing good and you can see where do you stand. He is very open professor for office hours and you can stop by anytime and ask. His quizzes were from the notes you are taking in the class so if you understand your notes well and took a good notes you can answer the questions. :: strong. :: Very clear. :: by giving more explanations if he feels students are lost. :: he would bring stories from real life to the subject. :: He made me interested to learn more every week during in the semester. the topic was new for me and,I enjoyed the time being at his class. :: Excellent. :: He encourages students to involve in class. :: Greatly. :: as i said he made it sample and interesting. :: His lectures are very interesting.

It's not fare because 50% on one test is a highly reck to me. :: the syllabus grading scale can be modified to make the final exam weighs less. :: great professor. :: nope. :: No. :: I felt like the term paper could have been better explained, a little more guidance would have been nice. :: Really enjoyed this course. Polymers was not a subject I had considered learning more about at all, but now I would like to learn more in the field through senior design and graduate work, possibly even career work. :: no. :: No. :: Overall Dr.Amer is a very good professor he is helpful and very well educated professor.

3150,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Dr. Mukhopadhyay was disappointingly ineffective as an instructor. :: Very effective at beginning of course, had to backtrack and explain some content from courses that were not prerequisite as the semester progressed. :: lectures are hard to follow and professor can not easily keep the attention of the students. :: The instructor of this course was overall generally effective in teaching the material in the class. :: she was very knowledgeable and is very clear on the explanation of the topic. the book does not cover the formulas and is very out of date. :: teaching efficiently, responsive to questions, behaving well"
3151,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- There was slight inconsistency/confusion concerning the syllabus. The quiz section led me to believe that the class would have a significant number of quizzes. However, we only had a quiz in the first week of class, testing us on our prior knowledge from ME 2700 - Structures and Properties of Materials I. I found this to be extremely unfair, to be graded on material that had been covered in previous classes, especially since several of the students in this particular class had taken this class several semesters (or years) ago. Our grades for this class should have been based solely on knowledge taught in this particular class, building on the material from previous classes. :: Homework and exams were graded as expected. :: expectations were not clear. :: yes the syllabus clearly spelled out the expected material and how each portion would be weighted in the final grade scheme. :: yes. :: Yes, she did."
3152,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- She was routinely late to this class. One such time, she was precisely 11 minutes late to class. However, she did use the full class period, from the time that she arrived, until the scheduled class ending. :: class occasionally began a little late, 5-10 minutes. but the 80 minute time slot made this unnoticeable when it did happen as all content was covered. :: almost always on time. always uses all the time. :: yes, class time was effectively utilized. :: yes. :: yes she always began on time and used all time allocated to class."
3153,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- I did not feel that Dr. Mukhopadhyay put significant effort into teaching the students this subject. Her methods of teaching nearly turned me off towards Ceramics. I got the impression that she did not really understand the subject herself, or if she did, she was not able to communicate it to her students. What is really sad is that I know that this is not just the case with me. Before taking the class, I spoke to several of her previous students, including successful Wright State alumni, and they all had the same comments. None of them felt motivated to learn about ceramics after taking a class with her, which is frustrating since I know that it is a very important field in Materials Science. It is sad to see the negative effects she has had on so many of these students, who could have potentially gone on to contribute greatly to the advancement of ceramics in industry and research. :: tried very hard to engage students and encourage in class participation in conceptual and problem solving situations. :: presentations at the end of semester show interest. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in our learning by actively engaging students in the class and encouraged students to utilize outside materials to reinforce material learned through the use of term papers. :: she answered all questions promptly. she also did a good job of tying the information to our previous knowledge. :: She encourages students to involve in class."
3154,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Sharmila Mukhopadhyay is NOT an effective communicator. She seems unfamiliar with computer tools, such as Pilot, and emailing students occasionally seems difficult to her. A frustrating part of her communication is how she caters to the graduate students taking the graduate level version of the class, rather than starting out teaching the basics so that the undergraduate students can understand. To make up for her lack of efficient communication, she tried to have students read all of the material and teach themselves, since she seemed incapable. :: Occasionally unclear on when homework was assigned and due, but very forgiving of due dates in these cases. :: not good. not bad. :: The instructor was responsive and  easy to communicate with both inside and outside of the class. :: good"
3155,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Several of the slides she used, and had her name on, looked suspiciously familiar to other older slides found online while studying. As for the lectures, most of her lecture time was spent explaining why/in what case a concept, equation, or method would be used in research or industry, rather than actually teaching the subject. Basically, we came out of lectures with an idea of why we would be using these concepts, but have little to no understanding of the actually concept. :: content was well organized, but there was a noticeable jump in difficulty of concepts through the last half of the semester. :: slide show lectures were well organized. lectures without slide shows seemed poorly organized. :: The course material was well organized into logical sections of the lecture material that progressively built from previous information. :: yes. :: I think that this course had this state."
3156,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- She always seemed to be in a hurry, and preoccupied with her graduate students. :: Open for email communication and office hours. :: no applicable. :: yes the instructor was available for consultation in any reasonable form of communication. :: yes. :: Yes she is available and responsive to our questions."
3157,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 4730,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Mukhopadhyay should stick to teaching graduate level courses since her inability to teach the basic subject to her students leads to more unnecessary time spent reading for the undergraduate students. It felt like she purposely hid information from the students, such as units on equations, then tested heavily on parts she did not emphasize. It was extremely frustrating to have to endure her teaching this semester. I would have learned a lot more if Dr. Amer was teaching the class, as I understood Polymers very well from his teaching style. :: there needs to be more homework. without the homework it was difficult to know what material was most important to focus on during the course. :: Nothing else comes to my mind. :: None"
3158,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The topics very well organised and good background was given for each topics. :: I enjoy Dr. Mukhopadhyay's classes. Her command of the subject matter is astounding. :: not bad. :: Excellent. :: The professor was pretty effective.   I feel like I learned quite a bit, BUT I could have learned much more.  With hardly any homework assignments and outside reading, and overviews of the material in class, I feel like I did learn it, but I didn't learn it in depth. :: The instructor was very effective in her teaching technique to present vast knowledge on advanced topics. :: She good. :: It was Excellent."
3159,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes
3160,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No, sometime she was late about 10 minutes, and would let us out early. :: Instructor was punctual on time. And she utilized overall time period of class perfectly. :: Yes. :: Yes"
3161,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- the applications of all new types of advanced materials in the present world were demonstrated very well which made the course interesting. :: She made sure we were all tracking, asking, or answering relevant questions nearly every class; particularly during problem solving sessions. :: OK. :: excellent. :: By posting her slides from the lecture and testing us several times over concepts she thought we SHOULD know before we graduate. :: Her teaching technique was fantastic. Which increased my interest to the subject.  The slides presented on advanced topic which are still new topics was outstanding. Those helped me a lot to understand difficult topics. :: She is good. :: explaining outside syllabus"
3162,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- The instructor was always available and cleared all doubts and questions that came up. :: Terrific for both. :: OK. :: excellent. :: Effectively.  Responds to e-mails very quickly. :: She was available for the help over the subject during his office hours and in class also. And always ready to help her students. :: Absolutely fine. :: good
3163,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Kind of.  Sometimes it's difficult to follow her train of thought, however, the point came across eventually.  Slides were clear and aided in my understanding. :: Yes they were well organized. :: Yes"
3164,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: She remarked many times with regard to homework, tests and term paper/presentation that we should contact her with any questions. Quick response to emails. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes instructor was really helpful all the time. :: Yes she is available. :: yes"
3165,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,2015 Fall,ME 7750,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- It was a very new and a fresh course and the subject was interesting. :: Tests were on the hard side, but it's a graduate class. And I didn't prepare well enough, MTH 6050 was dominating my budgeted amount of homework/study time. :: no. :: I feel like the professor should expect more out of her students.  I learned a lot, but I still think I could have learned more with additional homeworks, reading assignments, etc.  Overall, extremely intelligent professor, but sometimes her thoughts get lost in communication.  I enjoyed the course!. :: The instructor's teaching technique was fantastic and he was available every time when I need a help during entire course. :: No. :: nope"
3166,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good instructor. Kind of crazy, but he was straight forward with everything that he stated. Probably the most ""effective"" engineering instructor as far direct understanding of real world engineering applications. :: Very Effective. :: Very great professor, helps alot in class and in office hours. :: The instructor went through the material well. :: good. :: not effective on my learning of the subject. :: He is a good instructor. :: Talks about things not related to the subject and spends most of the time talking about them, when he talks about the subject, he just rushes through it. other than that, he's alright. :: Great. :: The class material in class had nothing to do with what was on exams.  He is a smart guy but he expects us to know everything and I think most students didn't and they struggled on the exams. :: Professor Slater has a very difficult teaching style. He is very informative when discussing the material, however he tends to come across in a ""he knows better"" manner very aggressively. :: Majority of learning done outside of class. He seems like he really wants his students to succeed, which is admirable; however, the implementation of the teaching was difficult to benefit from. :: Very effective, knows how to relate to students and get them engaged in his course.  Clearly invested in his students. :: Spend less time talking about irrelevant things and go over more examples. You said it yourself, you don't remember half the things you talk about the previous lectures. Neither do we. :: He did very well at describing problems and walking us through them based on what was needed to be found. :: Sometimes goes to quickly over examples, expects students to know what they should already know. Not a bad thing, but students can get confused in the beginning of an explanation and not understand anything the rest of the lecture. This can always be solved by asking questions, which he stressed endlessly the importance of asking questions. I think overall he was effective in his teaching, if the student desires to learn the material, which is the case for any class. :: the course was useful. the instructor was very nice and helpful. :: the exams are not similar to the homework. :: bad. :: did not explain how to solve problems very well, often generalized how to get to the solution. Class problems did not reflect the exams very well. didnt teach in every class. :: Very effective he showed us how to start from the beginning and work through a problem more effectively. :: Dr. Slater has a different teaching style than most professors. I feel that for me, his teaching in the lectures was not very effective. For the students who have excelled in their classes and do not need much outside help, Slater would be for them. The lectures were taught as if you knew the subject already and explanations for topics seemed hidden. Dr. Slater is far more effective after class (one on one) than a lecture based class. I was unable to make most of his office hours but when I did I learned far more in those 15 minutes than I did in any of his lectures. :: Dr. Slater was over a pretty good teacher. Although it seemed like he really just wanted to show off how much he knew, he really cares about his students and tries hard to help them learn the material. :: Good lectures, although the written notes were not as easy to follow. :: Good. :: Explained theory well but was extremely vague in how homework was to be completed. :: The instructor was clearly knowledgeable on the topic and cared about students learning the material. Class was filled with appropriate and properly challenging examples that helped my understanding of the material. I feel like he was a good professor. :: Good instructor but tricky tests. :: His lectures were easy to understand for the most part. He was available via email and in person. :: Very effective. Was available for consultation. :: Dr. Slater was very effective given the short class period. :: Effective but spent too much time on stories and experiences instead of material, had one too many pep talks when disappointed about exam scores. :: Good instructor, need more explanation on some things. :: Dr. Slater was available and easy to contact both through email and regular office hours.  I wish that more examples would have been solved in class since we sometimes were barely able to complete a single problem during a class period.  This was better during the later chapters for electrical circuits and fluid systems and had a good balance between teaching principles and actual example problems. :: he dose not explain clear the material. :: he tries really hard. he truly cares for the students and tries to encourage us as much as he can. he is really good helping students identify with him. But his classes are a little bit messy for me. got lost sometimes. :: he was the kinda of teacher that will tell us that we need to know something but he never explain it to us, there was some lecture where he came and sit and just gave us something to work on which doesn't make sense. also he will explain alot of things in MATLAB but in the test its all hand solution. :: Effective."
3167,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, however, because not many of the individuals taking the course are able to grasp basic concepts, the expectations were not set as high as they could have been. This instructor held us accountable for making sure we knew the content none the less. :: Yes. :: yes,. :: Yes. :: good. :: I dont know. the syllabus was not clear.. :: Yes. :: No. :: He evaluated our work based on how previous classes performed in the class and hardly gave any partial credit at all. :: Yes however exams were graded inconsistently. Small mistakes amounted to large amount of point deduction. :: Yes, to my understanding. A possible overall curve will be placed at the end of the course, depending on how results of the final.  Partial credit was few and far between, making it really difficult to receive a good grade.  Came to every class, did every homework assignment to the fullest, and still not performing well in examinations. They are worth 85% of the credit in the class, once again making it hard to do well. Especially when the examinations are in 55 minute time intervals. :: yes. :: Sure. :: yes. :: Yes. Syllabus had homework with due dates, exam dates, grading etc. He rarely changed the plan from the syllabus besides adjusting homework assignments due to where we were at as a class, we got a little behind it seemed. :: yes. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, course expectations were clearly defined in the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Unclear. :: Yes the work was evaluated fairly. :: Yes. :: Haven't got grades yet but yeah, he was clear from beginning. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Absolutely!. :: yes, but i think his syllabus is not fair. :: Yes."
3168,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, everyday filled the entire class period. Never a late class. :: Yes. :: yes,. :: Yes. :: good. :: yes. but some times would go over time. :: He start on time but finish after time. :: used most of the class giving advise. :: Yes. :: Yes he used the full class period and he always started on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. Sometimes filled the time with motivational speeches. This time would be better spent on covering the material that is required. :: absolutely. :: Yes, went over a lot of times due to talking so much. :: He taught from start to finish. :: Yes, always on time, sometimes went over the class period time. :: yes. :: no. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the class did routinely start on time and end on time. We rarely stayed over class, but when we did there was a good reason to do so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, often went past class period time to finish explaining something. :: Yes, he even went over a bit. :: yes. :: Yes, went over time a few times but wasn't his fault. The clocks at wright state need to be hard wired into the wall to keep them from stopping. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: he take extra time. :: yes. :: mostly. :: Yes."
3169,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By asking us what we were understanding and what he needed to discuss with him on a regular basis. He made sure we knew what we were learning. :: Office hours. :: The course material was very hard but he made it interesting. :: By explaining the topics well and working through examples. :: good. :: kinda of yes.. :: Nothing because he is teaching like we are grades students. :: required us to meet with him during office hours, which helped somewhat. :: Alway suggests to look at the big image. :: He told us he had office hours and said he is willing to help everyone. :: Made everybody come to his office for receiving any grade lower than a ""B"". :: He encouraged every student to come to his office hours and to constantly communicate with him. :: He likes to talk a lot. :: He told the class many times that we could come to his office at anytime if we were struggling with something related to the coarse. :: Begged students to ask questions if something wasn't clear. :: yes. :: by coming to class and  saying '' i don't feel like teaching''. :: yes and no,. :: He kept it light and effective. :: Dr. Slater showed interest by always finding time to meet up with him after class. He did this very well compared to other professor. If you tried to get help from him he seem to have more interest in your success in the course. :: He was always available to see after class. Responded to emails in a timely manner. Always there to help the students. :: He would always explain the problems in a real world situation. :: Well enough. :: He had mandatory review sessions for student who did not do well on test 1. He bumped into me a few times outside of class and was able to specifically identify my general mistakes in problem solving and give relevant advice. :: made professionalism a part of your grade. :: Yes. :: Was very interested. :: Related to real world stuff which was good. :: no. :: Was great during office hours, really concerned about how much material the students actually understood. And our overall success. :: i dont remember. :: Had routine office hours and even required struggling students to attend office hours or setup a meeting at another time."
3170,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: Effectively. :: very professionally. :: Very effectively. :: good. :: communicate very well .. :: Not bad. :: effective. :: In class good Off campus badly. :: He held office hours regularly and told us in class when to come visit him. :: Fair, difficult attitude. :: Well. :: really well. :: By talking a ton and also very inviting to his office. Talked a ton in his office too. :: He used email a lot out of class and told us what we needed to do in class. :: His explanations sometimes were too in-depth or physical that the students would miss the essential concepts of the topic. :: yes. :: bad. :: sometimes hard to follow. :: Very effective. :: In class communication was very poor. Lectures did not help with the course material. Out of class is where he was far more effective. :: Taught class a little too fast. It would be great if he slowed down a bit and showed a few more steps. We are not all PhD's like him. :: Very effective outside of the classroom. :: Good. :: Very easy to contact via email or in person for questions. :: Well, I feel I've addressed this. :: Good. :: Sometimes his explanations were worded in a confusing way, not because I didn't know what he was talking about. He emailed a lot to communicate outside of class. He was available for office hours. :: Was good at conveying points. :: Very effectively. If I didn't understand something I contacted him via email and he responded quickly. :: Available outside of class, very effective. :: Well. :: nothing. :: out of the classroom, Great!!  In the classroom not always.. :: mostly outside,. :: Effectively."
3171,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, we both covered new material, and went through examples to make sure we knew how they worked. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: good. :: no .. :: No. :: writing on the board was messy and hard to read. :: Sort of. :: No not really.  Some days we went over stuff that wasn't even relevant to the class like going over Simulink and we weren't tested over it. :: Yes. :: Somewhat. It would really help to have an introduction to each unit, telling what you need to know and how it is relevant to the material. :: yes. :: Yeah for the most part. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes and it complemented the book very well. :: Lectures did not contribute to the learning of this subject. They did tell what chapter we would be covering but the explanations of those chapters were very poor. :: yes. Wish the in class examples were closer to the homework and exam problems. :: Content was, although written notes on the board sometimes were not. :: Yes. :: Yes, though more material on how to solve problems would have been helpful. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Most were. :: Some lectures were hard to follow. :: Yes. :: Not well organized. :: Yes. :: no. :: no. :: no. :: Yes."
3172,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was available. :: Yes, highly available. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Always responded to emails quickly, was available during his office hours, and would schedule time outside of office hours if necessary. :: yes. :: no. :: yes. :: Yes office hours were very well spent. :: Dr. Slater was available when you needed him. He replied to emails quickly and was open to meet up after office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. It was encouraged. :: Yes. :: Yes. Very good at responding to emails. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, see point 5. :: Yes. :: Dr. Slater was very good at returning my emails and made time for me outside of office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: always available for questions at the office and by email. even replies during weekends. :: Yes."
3173,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- None for this instructor. :: Nope. :: He should give easier exams, curves the grades when the average is low. :: No. :: good. :: no. :: no. :: Professor must count for the class time in exams (when 55 minutes!)  Also, most homework problems are not related to class and exam problems. :: No. :: I'm good. :: No. :: i hated this class because of the instructor. :: no. :: Nope. :: System Dynamics covers a lot of material, so it is a difficult class to teach. A lot of subjects need to be perfected before taking this class. I do feel that Dr. Slater could have brought the class to speed quicker by a short review of the subjects we need for that certain chapter. Many of the important subjects at Wright State, such as statics and dynamics, are taught by professors that do not help you learn the subject. You are forced to learn how there test works rather than the subject itself. That is why a short review would benefit the class as a whole. Lecture time was not spent to help the majority of the class. A few students (In my class around 3) understood what questions Slater would bring up in class. He required to much knowledge of this class prior to his teaching. I feel that if the he would slightly take a step back and make sure the class as a whole were close to being on the same track, more students would show up to his lecture. :: N/a. :: No. :: You should give this guy a raise. I quite enjoyed his class. I feel like I could have done better in his class but I'll accept responsibility for that. I should have worked harder on homework. If you don't believe a student wrote this (it does seem quite nice) you can ask me to verify. Assuming this is properly anonimized, I'm the workout buddy. He'll know who that is. :: I hope I pass. :: He should grade the homework like he does the exams. What is considered partial credit on homework was way different than on the exam. The homework should be a good idea of how well I will do on the exam to improve the homework grade to then know ill do good on the exam. He should write down notes of questions asked in class that need to be answered outside of class so he doesn't forget. A few times students asked questions he said he would answer and forget to get the answer and remember the next class he should of had the answer. :: Expects a lot out of you and needs to focus more on how to apple concepts, homework was very tough. :: Tough course, but material was well covered. :: he is bad professor and he dose not now how to explain the material. :: I dont think he is the one who should teach this class. :: Some homework material was never covered in class, that would have helped the students. Other than that, the class was taught well and exams were fair."
3174,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- The instructor has a very broad understanding of the subject covered. This made for a smooth flow of class time. However, I feel that it also made it hard for the instructor to relate to students difficulty in grasping the topics covered. :: Awsome professional teaching with new innovative way of explaination. :: Good. :: He is nice to the person who is well acknowledged with all the subjects which are interlinked to this subject like computational methods for structural dynamics, Mechanical Vibrations, Finite Element Applications, Optimization and also who are good at programming in Python, Mat lab etc. In personnel I can not able to understand his lecture even in a single class.  So, i think this subject if it has pre-requisites of all these subjects will be good to the students I can give 05/10 for his delivery of lecture to meet the student understandings. :: Hard class, so obviously its not easy to keep up with the material when it is first given. I thought it the online notes as notebook files were a great way to understand everything that was presented. I felt that this course may need a few more prerequisites, Dr. Slater tended to assume I knew more than I did during lectures which I will admit is also something I should be able to catch up on in my own time. I frequently got lost in the lectures and couldn't even say where I was lost at. Some of the material was just really hard to follow. :: he is good professor. :: He is very helpful both in class and in his office hours. He explain course material in details with lots of figures."
3175,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I have not met his expectations.  So, he might evaluate 80% according to the papers that I have seen.  But his evaluation is hard. :: syllabus stated there would be multiple projects but the way the class played out over the semester there was only one. Other than that I thought grading, homeworks, and the project was absolutely fair. This was a graduate class and I felt like I was treated like a graduate student. :: yes. :: Yes he did"
3176,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He will utilize entire class time without wasting single second. :: Yes, class time was well spent. :: yes. :: Yes he does."
3177,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He very much encouraged class participation via discussion and questions about the topics presented. He also made himself easily available during office hours and email. :: Made me to learn programming. :: Good. :: His demonstration is not at all interested because his teaching will be impressive to the students who are well acknowledged with his terminology and took his classes earlier.  And also the student should be at PhD level. :: Dr. Slater was always available for office hours and spent time understanding the issues I was having and had particular interest in my understanding of the material. :: was good. :: By giving projects and explaining the practical uses of course material.
3178,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Communication was very good. However, as stated earlier he may have not related well with student struggles during the term. :: Extrodinary. :: Good. :: Out of the class communication is too subjective where I can understand little better compare to inclass. :: reasonably well. Sometimes I got lost but that had as much to do with the difficult content of the course as it did with Dr. Slater. :: awesome. :: He makes sure that you understand the subject"
3179,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- For the most part everything flowed well considering it was his first time teaching this class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: lectures are organized but not accurate. :: Yes, lectures and notes were presented very well and was one of the main reasons I found success in this class. :: yes. :: Yes"
3180,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, I never had an issue finding time to talk outside of class. :: yes. :: Yes he was. He was available most of the time even when it I did not have an appointment."
3181,Joseph Slater,2015 Fall,ME 7160,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Students who want to take this class in the future need to be explicitly informed that programming skills are a must if one hopes to pass the class. This in fact should be a prerequisite that is strictly adhered to. I was fortunate enough to have programming experience and conscious understanding that in order to solve problems posed in this class required numerical techniques. :: No. :: No. :: 1. In each and every class the last 10 minutes, if the professor explains the information that has explained in the last 01 hour without any formula and with application (Animated video will be better) is the very good idea for understanding the lectures 2. From the first class, if the programming in the form of projects or home assignments is encouraged then excellency can be seen from many students 3. If there is any new terminology in his field, that should be detailed according to the students understanding 4. The outline of the entire semester course details, if he detailed in the starting of the semester for half an hour, will be productive in terms of understanding. These comments might be helpful for the understanding levels of upcoming students who haven't registered for the course work and also not shown interest. I am very sorry if there is any thing wrong comments made by myself. Thanks for the opportunity to provide the survey to be completed. :: I think github has the potential to be a really good online environment for course materials. however, I spent more time than Id like to just figuring it all out. Perhaps a quick tutorial on github and some python basics would be good especially for students who are not great programmers."
3182,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He is a good individual. He is a good professor. He just needs to work on coming to terms with how much work he expects out of his students. For a three hour technical elective course, I found myself easily putting in 10+ hours for some projects that did not equate to a portion of the course grade that they should have been. He makes sure you learn the material, but most is taught be going through the book piece by piece. Like I said, good professor, just really expects 120% out of his students no matter what the subject. :: Good Instructor. :: He is very Patient and answers all questions, though he teaches more towards the graduate students assuming everyone has already learned topics from the prerequisite classes he also teaches, that other professors may not have gone over. Would be useful to have more examples. :: Dr. Wolff communicates very well, but his writing style on the whiteboard is somewhat disorganized. He tends to write where ever there is space, which can lead to confusing note layouts. Other then that, I have no complaints. :: Dr. Wolff was effective with teaching aeronautics by covering a lot of topics during the semester. :: Prof. Wolff is an excellent instructor. :: Dr. Wolff was a good professor who explained topics in good detail and very thoroughly. :: I wish we did more in class examples. :: Very effective and explained content well. :: Prof. Wolff is very clear on what is expected in the class. Explains the concepts with lots of examples and numericals. The projects assigned in the class have helped on understanding the concepts clearly. :: Good lecturer, available for questions. Very effective. :: Dr. Wolf was very organized and very knowledgeable about this course. :: Dr. Wolff is very knowledgeable and clearly explained everything in lectures. :: He is a good professor, but not the most organized in this class. Some of his lectures could be more effective, but since Dr. Wolff has not taught this class very many times, he is still learning how to teach it. :: Overall very effective. :: 10/10. :: Very effective in showing that he had an interest in the subject and wanted us to be interested in it as well. :: The lectures are very interesting, the tests are a little bit long but he fairly grade it based on how much do you understand about the theory and procedure. :: moderately effective."
3183,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Ehhhh.. Sure. He made the grading very fair, and came to terms with what we were able to provide with the time that we were given. However, there was a lot of stress build up when preparing for exams and such in this course. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, and any time there was a change from the syllabus, Dr. Wolff gave plenty of advanced notice and documentation. :: Dr. Wolff did evaluate the work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus and that he set in the beginning of the term. :: Yes, Dr. Wolff has stuck to the syllabus and his expectations are made clear. :: All was well defined but the projects. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The course expectations were made clear at the beginning. :: The grading was fair and stuck to the syllabus. :: 9/10. :: Aside from the projects and the second exam, everything that was excepted of us was laid out in full both verbally and in the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, for the most part.  There were projects that were not described very well in the syllabus, and the weight of them was not in the syllabus,"
3184,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, most if not all classes went the entire time period. Start to finish. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Wolff did use the entire class period to teach and sometimes would start class early if everyone was there since there was a lot of material to cover. :: Yes, every class started on time and used the full class period. :: yes. :: Everytime. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was always on time and used the full class period.  Lecture time was well spent going over notes and examples. :: Yes. :: Yes. He always used the full class period and sometimes went over. :: Yes he did. :: 9/10. :: Yes, not a second was spared. :: Yes, he spends the class time very well. :: Class was started on time for the bulk majority.  There was one or two classes that were started late.  Class took up the full period."
3185,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He was always able to provide some input to all interesting questions that were asked by students in the course. :: Answered all questions and was available outside of class. :: Answers all question clearly. :: Dr. Wolff would revise the schedule based on how busy the class was, so that there were very few times this class competed with others for attention. :: Dr. Wolff demonstrated interest in the learning by coming up with projects to simulate the topics of discussion. :: Dr. Wolff always responded to emails and helped students with questions. :: yes. :: Projects based on useful concepts discussed in class. :: Prof. Wolff is very approachable in the class and also during the office hours. :: He asked questions to make sure we understood material. :: Questions were always answered, and homework/projects were always relevant to what we were studying. :: Yes. He is always there to answer questions and make sure you understand. :: He was willing to answer any questions, most often he tried to get the students to come to the conclusion on their own by reminding them of a few things we had covered and then leading them to it. :: 10/10. :: Although there was not much time to go over a lot of questions during class, we were able to meet during his office hours. He showed great concern that we understood the material and was open to any questions that we may of had. Additionally, he brought a lot of real world applications and applied them to what we were learning. A lot of this was brought full circle in the last class but it would have been nice to have this sprinkled through out the whole semester. :: There are always new materials in lectures. The materials are very complicated but i think he explained and example were very well and clear. :: He was available and willing to help."
3186,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very quick to responding to messages from the students, and always provided quality information. :: Very Effectively. :: well. :: Dr. Wolff communicated very effectively. :: Dr. Wolff communicated very well in and out of the class. He was available by phone and email during the week and weekend to quickly answer any questions we might have had on the homework or projects. :: Dr. Wolff answered every question in class and was available in his office as well. :: He was always available. :: very well. :: Yes he is interested in each student work. :: He communicated well and often. :: He sent some last minute emails regarding the projects: due dates, and important information needed to solve the problems. :: Very well, always quick in responding to questions or emails. :: For some of the assignments, he did not make his expectations clear as to what all he wanted. However, by the end of the semester he had fixed this problem. He kept changing his mind for the first project, which was very frustrating while trying to complete it along with our other class assignments. :: Effectively. Was available outside the classroom and even outside office hours. :: 9/10. :: Yes, he was very effective in replying to emails as well as making time to meet with the students if they were not able to meet during the office hours he had listed in the syllabus. :: He is a little bit busy, but always reply our email within 24h. In class, he always try to find a best way to answer all your questions. :: Not the best communications regarding projects.  He did not communicate what was expected and revised the projects several times."
3187,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Very well organized, but then again, he had the opportunity of teaching this course in the past and always came prepared to teach the information provided to him. :: Yes. :: Mostly, as mentioned above, the in class notes had a somewhat confusing format. :: The course content an lectures were well organized. :: Yes, our lectures followed the book chapters very well. :: I wish there was less derivation and more examples. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, however the time given for assignments was generally underestimated. Due dates had to be pushed back to allow time to complete projects. :: Yes. His lectures were very organized and when he made a mistake during class, he was sure to post the correct solution to pilot. :: Yes. :: His lectures were pretty well organized. :: The lectures went smoothly most of the time, there were a couple times where there was an error in his notes that would create a short delay, nothing major. :: 10/10. :: The teacher presented some of the most well organized and laid out lectures to date. Although the syllabus had some leeway, we knew what we were learning and what we would be learning next. :: Yes, we don't have enough time to cover everything in the book in one semester, and he pick out all the important and helpful materials for the class. :: Fairly well organized.  The lectures could run into some issues, such as incorrect equations, which were corrected by the next class."
3188,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Very much so. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Wolff always responded to my questions in a timely fashion. :: yes. :: very available. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He was available when I had questions via email. :: Yes. :: Yes. He is always quick to respond to emails and answer questions that you may have. :: Yes. :: 9/10. :: As stated above, yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was available."
3189,J. Wolff,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Nope!. :: Good Instructor, Difficult material. He did a good job. More Projects that are less involved (time consuming) would be more effective than few projects that consume a lot of time in my opinion. :: No. :: None. :: no. :: NO. :: I just audited the course for a few classes. :: No. :: He is a hard, but fair instructor.  The only aspect of this class that needs work is the projects.  We were the guinea pigs for them and it showed.  The amount of confusion that came with each one was very frustrating. :: Very good overall, Dr. Wolff's lectures are very helpful and I enjoyed the course overall. :: This department needs more professors like him. He's one of the very few good ones in the department. :: great teacher I enjoy his teaching method.  I would attend another class if he was the teacher. :: For the lectures it would have been nice to get an idea of what we were working towards. For example, show the end result so that we know what we are looking for and then take us step by step on how to get there. Additionally, more examples of problems or more homework would have been helpful although the textbook used didn't exactly facilitate this. Moreover, more concise projects. It is understood by the students that the projects were a new idea to help us understand the material better, and the instructor listened to the students when they said they needed more time on the projects and was not against extending the time. The projects did help to the overall understanding of the material and were more effective in illustrating what was being taught to the students more that the homework was. The only suggestion for the projects is that they be weighted more in the overall grade or to make the work load less intensive. With this being said, the projects were very helpful in contributing to the overall understanding and they should be included in future teaching of this subject. Finally, it would be better if this intense course was held earlier in the day when the students aren't so sleepy. :: Great professor His assignments are long and hard, but he fairly grade it. :: Too much theory and equation deriving.  More examples would have been helpful.  The projects did not contribute all that much."
3190,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Who?. :: I only saw Dr. Wolff. :: Not my instructor. :: I do not know who this guy is.
3191,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Who?
3192,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- I have no idea who you are talking about.
3193,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Does not exist.
3194,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- ..
3195,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- He was the worst.
3196,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- He was a mute."
3197,Ramya Vankamamidi,2015 Fall,ME 4430,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- It's almost like he wasn't even there."
3198,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Spends time wisely and wants you to learn. :: Not good, he ridicules his students. He expects too much out of his students. He plays favorites. He was in Germany for one entire month. I don't think he should have had the class due to his months absence. :: Dennis was excellent at teaching this course. He was very helpful with problems that arose when doing the design tasks and projects. He was also generous when grading. The only problem with this course was the fact that he was gone for a month in Germany. He made up for it by holding longer classes and staying after if he needed to help students, but it was very disruptive to the course. It would have went a lot better if there would have been a teacher or grad student to help students during that month. Overall, this course was very helpful in increasing my abilities as a designer. :: ok. :: Instructor is effective and knowledgeable. :: Dennis is a very good instructor who genuinely cares about his students learning and success. Dennis is very good at motivating his students to get their work done."
3199,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: He barely graded anyones work. I know some kids who simply copied over photos of their work without changing the text from previous tasks. He gave students 100% regardless. He plays favorites as well. :: yes. :: No. Expectations are held at an unrealistic level and the grades are heavily curved to compensate. :: Yes.
3200,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes.
3201,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He did not. He ridiculed students in class. He put students on the stop. This did not create a learning environment. This creates a classroom full of vulnerable students. :: yes. :: Instructor was interested in our learning but tended to treat students with levels of disrespect at times. This caused the learning environment to be unpredictable, stressful, and uncomfortable at times. :: Dennis would routinely stop lecture and ask for questions so that each student was caught up in a particular exercise that we working working to complete."
3202,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Okay. :: great. :: Instructor was helpful when present and was accessible through Pilot discussion boards. Instructor was not present for the month of June which made communication more difficult. :: Dennis is able to be reached in the classroom very easily by raising your hand and outside of classroom either by the discussion board on pilot or by email if it is more personal.
3203,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Somewhat, he would float from one subject to another, expecting us to retain the information. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, all of the course content was laid out in the syllabus and followed in class."
3204,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Sure. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dennis would respond to emails/discussion board posts within an hour inside of regular working hours."
3205,Dennis Hance,2018 Summer,ME 4160,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Dennis is a mean, unfair teacher, who treats his students with favoritism. He doesn't realize this but the entire student body does. :: He told us the very first week of the course that all of the design tasks and projects did not have a due date. He said as long as we turn them in before the end of the semester they will count. Then a third of the way through the semester he started giving us due dates on everything. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see this is clearly going back on his word. Then the students that went to Germany he said we didn't have to do anything while over there because the work we do in Germany will count for what we miss in this class. This is also a lie because he chewed all of us out in Germany half way through the trip because we were not working on it. I learned a lot in this class and thought it was very beneficial don't get me wrong, and no one would be upset if he didn't tell us lies. But the lies are what made me and many others very upset. :: no. :: Thank you for running this course Dennis!"
3206,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: Great, every topic was covered with great detail. :: Dr. Thomas is one of the best professors I've ever had at this institution, hands down. :: He was very effective. :: yes. :: Amazing. :: He covered the subject well and covers everything that will be on the exam. :: Cares about his students, but there's a disconnect between class difficulty and homework/exam difficulty.  Tons of time needed to actually bridge the gap between lectures to homework, then homework to exams. :: Very. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Dr. Thomas is very effective at communicating lecture content as well as keeping the class focused and involved. :: 8/10. :: Dr. Thomas is one of the best instructors at Wright State. He is very detailed in his explanations and always attempts to explain things in a way that are visual or have applications in the real world. :: very good. :: Wasn't very effective. Teaches terribly. Does not explain fundamentals, he just gives you equations and assumptions out of thin air. :: Scott is the example other professors at wright state should follow. :: Fantastic, one of the best professors at WSU. :: Dr. Thomas is an amazingly fair, structured, and organized professor. His explanations are clear, and he makes sure everyone is on the same page before moving on to the next topic. :: 10/10. :: Scott was great. He was consistent and very clear upon expectations. He followed his syllabus to a tee and evaluated the class according to what he laid out in that syllabus. :: He's my favorite professor in all my college time. He's energetic, cares about students' learning and also really funny. He went over the material pretty quickly, but this is expected in summer semester.  He does a good job at deconstructing and explaining every step of the material, and putting it on terms we will understand. He has fun examples and keeps class interesting. :: good. :: Great professor. I learned a lot, and everything was set up in the course great, and related to real world applications, which made it easy to understand."
3207,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Absolutely. :: Yes. :: Yes, he follow it to a T. :: yes. :: Yes, every day. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Yes, the syllabus is the defining contract for everything within Dr. Thomasâs class. :: Yes. :: Yes. The syllabus was discussed the first day with specific expectations. Then it was reference every class so that students could see exams approaching and take initiative and prepare accordingly. :: exactly. :: Sure. :: yes. :: Yes he provided a syllabus on day one and stuck to it chapter by chapter. It's impressive to see a professor have such a difficult curriculum to teach, plan the semester out and get through it all and have most of us following along and understanding. :: The expectations were very clearly described in the course syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he is very organized with his notes/ assignments/grading. It was all laid out and explained in the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes"
3208,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: He made it a point to start class exactly at the posted time, every time. :: Yes he always started at exactly 4:40 pm. :: yes. :: ""4:40 exactly!"" except that one time.. ""Ah man, I missed my 4:40 exactly moment. You guys distracted me!"". :: Class always started on time and ended on time. :: Yes, on time on the dot every day. :: 4:40 Exactly. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Yes  â4:40 EXACTLYâ. :: Yes. :: 4:40 exactly! We always started class on time and used the full period in most classes. The one time he let us out a little early was because we had a System Dynamics exam right after. He understood that we have other obligations outside of Heat Transfer. He obviously cares about his students a great deal. :: yes. :: Yes. :: every class he starts exactly on time. :: Yes Scott started at ""4:40 exactly"" cause that's how he rolls. :: ""4:40 exactly!"". :: 4:40 exactly except the day he was distracted by nick. :: Yes. :: Alway right on time. He's always early and starts talking at exactly 4:40 . We only didn't use the full period once or twice and that's because he didn't want to introduce a new thing with just a few minutes left in class. :: yes"
3209,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Was very responsive to questions and remembers people's names. :: Absolutely, shared many personal experiences with the material covered in the course as well as used a lot of examples that were easy to understand or picture to make his point. :: I've never had a professor be so hell-bent on making sure everyone understood the material the best they could. :: he was always available for questions and would always make sure the student had a better understanding after they asked a question even if it meant talking after class. :: yes. :: Abso-posi-lutly. :: He has a strong passion for the subject that is shown strongly when teaching. :: Very enthusiastic teaching style. :: Yes. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Dr. Thomas loves his job an is very interested in my learning. This was apparent in everything from his expectations to his teaching and evaluations. :: Thomas readily answers any questions and addresses all concerns. :: Scott would always take time to answer questions during class to make sure everyone understood the material. :: yes. :: Emphasized ""ultra fairness"" but didnt really care that we learned or not. :: With the enthusiasm of someone who measures their coffee in gallons not ounces. :: Providing the home work solutions really helps allot. When I first took his Matlab class I thought it was kinda silly him providing the solutions but now that I've been through more classes I see the benefits. If you take the time to walk through each solution and see how things work it helped me get much further than just using the book. Plus hw is only worth 10% so the hw scores arnt going to pass anyone that doesnt put in the work for the exams. :: yes. :: Scott would offer us real world examples of the concepts being covered, as well as fielding any questions we had at any time in lecture. He often spoke to many students after lecture and discussed their future plans for their education with them. For me personally, we spoke about whether or not I should pursue a Masters Degree in ME where he gave me his advice to do so. We also discussed my future Senior Design class and what I would want to do for that, where he gave his advice as well. :: He really cares about students and making sure people were understanding the content. He was always available for questions and even answered questions after class time ass over. :: yes"
3210,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very effectively. :: Very well. :: Excellently. :: yes, he was very good about it. :: good. :: Extremely effective. I think the man lives by his email. :: Communication was great in and out of class. :: Very responsive to questions in class Regularly responded to email within a day. :: Very. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Very well. :: 10/10. :: Scott communicated very well in the classroom and out. :: very good. :: He was always available to talk. :: very. :: Posted or emailed anything we needed to know so I would say thats as much as he could do. :: 10/10. :: Extremely effective. :: He emailed grades as soon as they were posted on pilot and his emails were always well timed. :: yes when needed. :: The professor was very easily accessible and responded back every time I messaged him within an hour."
3211,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Best organized lectures I've seen to date from any professor. :: yes, he was organized from day one. :: yes. :: Every Class. :: It was well organized. :: Yes, schedule was well kept the entire course. :: Yes. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas is one of the most organized professors I have had. :: Yes. :: The lectures were always organized around the syllabus so I always knew what to expect during class. :: yes. :: some what. The home works were super long and tedious. The homework due dates were not consistent with what was covered in class for the week. (i.e some problem have not been covered in class yet but were already due). :: extremely so. :: His website had everything laid out in a convenient and orderly manner I really liked that he posted the homework problems and solutions as well as the exam content for all the previous semesters. :: Extremely well organized. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Always! It's all laid on on his webpage. I took Matlab with him previously and I still refer back to his notes there from time to time. :: yes. :: The course was extremely well organized, and the online lectures were fantastic! Wright State needs more of this!"
3212,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Seemed to always be available. :: yes he always had office hours and would meet with students around the office hours if necessary. :: yes. :: Always. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Scott always made himself available to students that needed extra help on a subject. :: yes. :: sure. :: yes. :: Yes I would say he was, he would stay after if anyone needed any one on one time and he had office hours. :: Always. :: yes. :: Yes, Scott would reply in timely manner inside or outside of the classroom. :: Yeah, I met on office hours a couple times when I had some questions on homework problems. He was very helpful and willing to meet. :: yes. :: He responded within an hour at all times of day."
3213,Scott Thomas,2018 Summer,ME 3360,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Wonderful class would not have wanted to take the course with anyone else as the professor. He turned a very difficult class into an enjoyable and educational experience. :: Would take him again for any class he offers. :: Great Professor, we need more professors like him. :: yes. :: Please have him teach Thermodynamics 2 this fall!!!!. :: The exams are very demanding.  A lot of personal effort must be made to do well in terms of time needed to prepare.  It's very difficult if the person (such as myself) is employed at or near full time. :: No. :: neutral. :: not good very hard exams. :: Dr. Thomas should teach me every subject including Pickle Ball. :: would take another course with this instructor. :: checkaroonie and a banana. :: Fantastic semester, really enjoy being in the classes you teach. Your have really good way of explaining hard or complex subject matter in a way that relates it to simple things that are unstandable. Thank you very much for all the help transfer knowledge. :: I wish Dr. Thomas taught all of the required classes for the engineering department at WSU. He is an extraordinary professor, and I consider myself lucky to have had him for two courses. I very much appreciate his enthusiasm, organization, clarity and fairness. Thank you, Dr. Thomas!. :: none. :: Scott is one of my favorite professors!. :: He's a really great professor. I really enjoyed this class. Exams were challenging but fair to the content.. I really enjoy his style of teaching and I hope I can always be as happy and excited about my job as he is. :: I greatly enjoyed this course and would gladly take another course from Dr. Thomas again."
3214,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- So incredibly unorganized! Very hard to learn without outside help. Quite frequently scattered when trying to explain concepts, class structure, answers to questions, really anything. :: good. :: good. :: The teacher obviously knew a lot about the topic, however, derivations in class were sometimes hard to understand. I felt like the material was made harder than it actually was sometimes. :: He's a very bad teacher. Has trouble communicating sometimes. Makes mistakes or misspeaks. :: Good. :: less effective than reading the book. :: Dr. Mian was extremely ineffective.  He seemed preoccupied the entire semester, and was not able to convey information to students.  The only subject matter I actually learned in the class were items that I learned myself, outside of class.  It is very disappointing that a professor of such poor caliber teaches so many courses at the university.  I had him for Mechanical Design 1 this semester and will have to endure him for Mechanical Design 2 in the future.  I have also been informed by some of my classmates, though I have not confirmed myself, that Dr. Mian is also in charge of teaching other classes.  It is extremely disappointing that any university would employ a professor that is as awful as Dr. Mian. :: 7/10. :: Not very effective at all. I can't really say that I've learned anything from this course. :: Covered the material in lecture."
3215,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Not sure just for the plain fact of rarely getting homework and quizzes returned to us after the grades were posted. Still even now while writing this evaluation on the last week of classes, we are missing 4+ quiz grades, and 4 homework grades. Quizzes were not scheduled or presented in the way the syllabus describes.  ""Quizzes will be IN-CLASS, open book and closed notes."" Majority of quizzes were posted on Pilot after the time stated in class, one in-class quiz was closed note, dates listed in the syllabus for these quizzes were not reliable and hardly followed. Homework was assigned with less than a week to complete and not posted routinely. :: good. :: good. :: Yes. :: sure. :: Yes. :: no. :: It is hard to say.  There was not very much instruction given for the class to know what to expect.  At the beginning of the semester, Dr. Mian informed us that he did not have a grader (for our class of about 15-20 students), so he would not be assigning much homework since he didn't have time to grade it.  In addition, he informed the class that he would not be grading the homework, but would instead just be giving completion credit to those that turned it in.  A project was assigned and very little instruction was given regarding it.  Many of the other groups I spoke with about the project simply said they were guessing at their dimensions or were just oversizing everything in their design to avoid having to do any real design work on it. :: yes. :: Yes. Although, he had a difficult time following the syllabus when it came to teaching material. :: Yes."
3216,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, fairly routine. :: good. :: good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, Dr. Mian was rarely late and utilized the entire period, just not well. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes."
3217,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Not sure. Hard to tell if there was any interest. :: good. :: good. :: He always asked if we had questions and would willingly give a detailed answer. :: he did not. He was not very approachable during office hours. :: Giving good example problems. :: he didnt. :: I cannot say that Dr. Mian showed any interest in any of the students' learning.  If it didn't reflect badly against him, I doubt he would care if the entire class failed. :: yes. :: Couldn't really see much interest"
3218,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Out of the classroom: Emails were very helpful when assignments were posted (only because they were not routinely posted until halfway through the semester.) In the classroom: Good communication was scarce. A lot of times, students had a hard time understanding what was being asked and/or knowing what to ask due to so deep of confusion. Questions were asked and many times answered, but mostly confusion still lingered among many of us. :: good. :: good. :: Sometimes there was a delay in grades being uploaded to pilot and dropboxes being opened on time but it was mostly good. :: average. :: Well. :: very poorly. :: Communication was extremely poor.  Dr. Mian would regularly tell the class he will post items to Pilot at a certain time or by a certain date, and then never post them or post them late.  Not even half of the grades were posted at the semester's end, so the students had no clue where they stood going into the final. :: alright. :: He communicated well. :: Effective outside of the classroom, however expectations of what we needed to know were not communicated clearly in the classroom."
3219,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Not at all. Luckily those of us who went to class were caught up on short-notice homework and quiz assignments, but they were not posted routinely until more than halfway through the semester. Until then, usually scheduled ""spur of the moment"" and not frequently as otherwise stated in the syllabus. :: good. :: good. :: Not really. :: not really. :: Yes, grades could have been posted earlier, but other than that good organization. :: no. :: There was some organization to the lectures, but we were pretty much behind schedule the entire semester.  In order to try to catch up, Dr. Mian held several classes where he flew through the lecture material and told the students to not worry about writing things down because he is posting all of his lecture notes to Pilot. :: decent. better at the end of the course than the beginning. :: Not organized in the slightest. :: To a certain extent, however the material covered in class jumped around from all over the text. Also, there were many times that an example problem was started in class and not finished, and when asking to finish in the next class, we were told that there was not enough time and that we were behind. The final two topics in the class were merely brushed over in the last lecture period prior to the final exam."
3220,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- I wasn't inspired to even attempt. :: good. :: good. :: Yes. :: not very effective during office hours. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Dr. Mian did answer several questions I had emailed him throughout the semester within an acceptable amount of time. :: yes. :: Yes"
3221,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4140,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I think it is clear that lack of organization was a huge contributor to the difficulty of this course, and many of us agree. This is not particularly hard material when learned elsewhere. In class, similar variables were frequently not distinguished until asked about, and thank goodness for those students who were aware to ask about them. Handwriting in class and on notes posted to Pilot was almost unreadable. Pilot notes were posted directly before class, making it almost impossible to come to class prepared. Constantly had to pester the prof. to hand back graded homework. Feedback was rarely given for homework and never for quizzes. Our last quiz was one question on Pilot and the answer assigned was wrong, leaving major confusion among the entire class the week before finals. Grade still has not been adjusted.  Unorganized, noncommittal, unorganized. :: good. :: good. :: He seemed like a good guy and cares about how students are doing in the class. But I found the lectures hard to follow and that restricted what I took away from the class. :: I really wanted to learn the material in this class but he did not do a very good job teaching at all. Kind of disappointing because now I will  have to go through the book all over again and learn key topics. :: I have become more and more disappointed with Wright State's Mechanical Engineering program.  Although there are some great professors that are employed at the university, professors like Dr. Mian greatly hinder the learning of students.  I would much rather take a very hard class with a professor that thoroughly teaches the material, and teaches it well, than take a class with a professor like Dr. Mian in which I feel like a great deal of my time was wasted.  Often times, I end up getting at least an ok grade in these courses because the professor curves the final grades in order to not look bad with a high percentage of failing students.  Please, help the students by doing away with professors such as Dr. Mian and replacing them with truly caring professors that are skilled at instructing students.  At the very least, limit the number of classes that these poor professors are allowed to teach.  I feel that there is no reason I should have to encounter Dr. Mian twice, or more, throughout my college career.  I shouldn't even have to encounter them once, but I do understand that it is sometimes unavoidable.  It just seems to happen too often at Wright State. :: no. :: Stay on track better for the sake of your students."
3222,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Sufficent in providing information and having the ability to deliver the material in the classroom setting. :: For the material presented, Dr. Mian did an alright job. He seemed spaced out in some of the lectures but overall delivered appropriate material. :: Good. :: He was very unorganized. :: . :: good. :: good. :: good. :: good. :: 7/10. :: very. :: I don't learn very well from this professor. :: Okay. Feels like he looses the classes attention to easy. :: 1. :: Nice guy but his lectures are a bit disorganized so its hard to track what hes saying when he is deriving an equation. :: Terrible, he either does not know the material or does not know how to communicate it. His lessons appear to have no structure and just uses other people's material. When I looked at the syllabus it was titled University of Kentucky. He clearly just copied a syllabus from UK and added a couple of things. He didn't think to change the file name after he downloaded it. Same with his powerpoints, appeared to be someone else's material or he had never rehearsed going through them because he would get hung up on slides, skip, or not know what to say, or just tell us to read up on topics outside of class because he could not explain them. :: Not great. Felt like some days I might have learned something if I look back over the power points and notes more and other days I felt like I new less coming out of class than I did going in. We needed more examples to make any of the topics we covered effective but instead we just talked a little about some of them and moved on to the next topic. :: He is a good professor, whom I have had for several classes. I wish the group projects could have been assigned earlier in the semester as everyone in my groups had busy schedules that didn't allow for a lot of time to meet as a group. :: He is really passionate about what he teaches, and it shows in his teaching style. :: Instructor was effective and used useful examples in class to explain. :: Mian is knowledgeable on the topic and seems passionate about it, which makes the class more interesting.  He does a good job with presenting the information in a combinations of ways including powerpoints, on-board notes, videos and articles. :: Excellent. :: Excellent. :: Not good. :: dr Akm Mian is a professor with great knowledge in the subject! I would rate him out of out as an effective professor"
3223,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: YEs. :: yes. :: good. :: Yes. :: yes.. although he does need to work on getting grades back at a more even pace.  he was fine with the exam, but for the homework the wait was too inconsistent. :: Yes. :: 1. :: He did provide a syllabus and stuck to it but what I didn't like was homework was not turned back in a timely manner to be useful as exam review. :: No, not at all. Mian just teaches like crap, keeps really low expectations, arbitrarily assigns grades to assignments without truly evaluating them and just curves everyone at the end to keep from being looked into by admin. He admitted to not knowing solutions to exams. A student's answer was marked wrong on an exam and the student asked what was the correct answer and Mian said he didn't know... How could he have properly evaluated our exams if he didn't know the solutions to the problems he assigned after he had graded them?. :: I'm not sure. I was given almost no feedback on any of my homework assignment. It was frustrating trying to learn from my mistakes when there was no feedback on what I did wrong or how I could improve. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, syllabus was followed and clear to understand. :: Yes.  Evaluations felt fair based on the syllabus provided. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: No. :: yes"
3224,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: good. :: good. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: 1. :: Yes he used the full period. :: No he emailed saying class would be starting an hour or so late. We would get out early sometimes, and most of the time during class he kills time by switching between the dry erase board, projector (which he has never been able to figure out how to use, just a press of a button), and powerpoints. He constantly raises the projector curtain up and down while switching between lecturing methods because this kills about a minute to raise or lower the curtain. This seems to be his go to method to stall for time or to get through lecture. He emailed us to say we would not have lecture the last period before the final exam because we got through all the material in the class. I couldn't even tell you what we discussed in this class. :: Usually. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, instructor always started on time and used full class period. :: Yes, almost always started exactly on time and finished the class right on time. :: Yes he started his classes on time and used the full class. :: Smart usage of class time. :: Yes. :: he was on time to every class!"
3225,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Showing and explaining all of his personal research as well as previous students to help the understanding of different topics. :: He was always available to answer questions and offer advice. :: Yes. :: Emailed us. :: good. :: good. :: good. :: He was enthusiastic about class every session and offered a few minutes of Q&A, on top of answering questions anyway, during the lecture. :: yes. :: 1. :: He got a guest speaker which was cool. :: He would ask if everyone understood what he just flew through or wrote that you could not read and when I said I couldn't understand he would usually just move on or say to ask a classmate outside of class. :: He wanted us to learn but I don't think he was using the right methods. :: Yes. :: By using real world examples and brought in physical parts to look at to aid in understanding. :: He explained real time examples in detail. :: By live examples. Circulating lab manufactured components relating to the current topic. :: He is not taking any interest to explain the topic with full extent. :: yes"
3226,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good outside the classroom and decent in the classroom. :: Well enough. :: Very well through Pilot and email. :: He would start a sentence off strong but as the sentence got longer he would trail off and mumble. :: good. :: good. :: good. :: 6/10. :: pretty good. :: Yes. :: 1. :: Other than his lecture notes being very disorganized, he did send emails if he wasn't going to be there. :: Mian is very bad at communicating. There is an obvious language barrier. He tells you on the first day of class that if you cannot understand him or if he uses the wrong English word, to try and have a classmate clarify for you. :: Great. :: He did good. :: Very well by using pilot and email. :: Very effectively.  Mian was able to convey the material very well and was always able to be reached via email outside of class with a response being received in a timely manner. :: He was very effective. :: Excellent. :: Not good. :: i am really satisfied with the communication he made both in and out of the clasroom"
3227,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Seemed to be a course that was put together quickly and without a good amount of resources. :: Not really. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: good. :: good. :: Organization could be improved. :: yes. :: no, jumps from slide 25 to slide 7 then slide 16. Very hard to follow lectures. :: Ye. :: 1. :: Not really, he would add slides during lecture, and some of the content he only showed to people in class but It would have been nice to have that available afterwards. :: Ha! not at all. He clearly has no lesson plan prepared. He would jump from topic to topic and not even tell you what he was explaining. He would write some equations on the board but not explain what they applied to. He left variables out of homework problems and told students to look them up or make them up. Most of the time did not explain what variables were in the equations or where to find them. I don't know why we were required to buy the text book for this course because we did not use it at all and I could only find one equation he showed us in the text book. :: No. I still have no idea what is going on. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was organized on pilot. :: Yes, they seemed well organized and followed the syllabus well. :: Yes perfectly. :: Very well organized. :: Yes. :: they were more than well organized"
3228,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: never contacted him. :: idk. :: good. :: good. :: Yes. :: did not go to any. so I can't comment. :: yes. :: Yes. :: 1. :: I didn't contact him outside of class. :: No, I asked him about a homework grade I received and he told me he would review it the following day and never did. It still has not been settled and final grades are about to be assigned. Also he assigned a group project to create a part in Solidworks. We made a part and asked him if it was okay and he never responded. :: Usually responded to emails in a reasonable amount of time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he had weekly office hour. :: Yes, see above answer. :: Yes he was. :: Yes. :: No. :: yes"
3229,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 4180,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Not at this time. :: no. :: No. :: idk. :: good. :: good. :: nope. :: lectures were very quiet, he could speak louder. :: 1. :: I know this was an additive manufacturing class and I believe you are very intelligent but I think you were too overly negative towards traditional manufacturing methods. There is allot of skills that can learned from being able to use those methods and not everything needs to be printed. I think more engineers need to get out in a shop to get turn some metals, drill and ream some holes, and possibly do some surface machining to help demonstrate application of the fundamentals of engineering. One more thing, as an additive class I think we should have done our own 3D prints. :: I don't think I have enough time or room in this field to explain why Mian is such a bad professor. In fact this is probably a waste of time all together because when I made a complaint last semester I was told to go to another school if I was not satisfied with a course (great customer service). Instead of making complaints to the university I have directed them to the general public and anytime someone asks me how I like Wright State I am always sure to give a negative review and advise them, their children, or anyone they know to go to another school because Wright State is a terrible institution. I talked with other students in the class who work with additive manufacturing outside of school and they said what material he did present to us was outdated by about a decade and he made all kinds of false comments about additive manufacturing. :: Students need a few examples of each subject covered in order to draw necessary conclusions about the material and its uses as well as the proper methods of applying it. Try shortening the explanation of how it was created and give us workable problems in class that we can draw conclusions from. We need something to interact with so just lecturing us and then asking if we have questions is not going to fill in the gaps that we have on the material. A student needs to be given the chance to test what they just learned without being graded so we can find out what we are missing and what we need to gain to progress further. :: While the class seemed well organized and taught well, it would have been beneficial to have to set up our own .stl files for printing, or have to choose what method of printing we thought would be best to print our parts for the project.  It also would help to have the group project be in smaller groups if only one part is required.  Other than that, it was an interesting class on a topic that is still being researched and developed. :: Overall good experience, worth it. :: Everything is pretty good and I would love to recommend him to any of my friends interested in learning a practical course and a great teaching by him. I got interested in additive manufacturing and I would like to consult him for my future works on additive manufacturing and take guidance for that. :: I had a very bad experience with professor. He is not organised and putting much efforts in teaching. :: no"

3237,Akm Mian,2018 Summer,ME 8950,Question 8,0
3238,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Effective instructor but often lectures in class on aspects that are not on the curriculum or test. :: very ""true to life"" which sparks interest, fair grading style, prompt and extensive results (tests and homework), flexible in the sense that he'd adjust the material being taught according to what we needed. :: Very effective at keeping everyone's attention. Not a boring teacher and easy to understand. :: Excellent at getting material across in the classroom as well as outside the classroom. :: Was effective. Learned plenty about real world applications. :: He is very knowledgeable and knows what he is talking about. I think he was very effective given he wasn't given everything he needed to know about the semester to help him succeed. The ME department or Slater, whichever one that was suppose to prep him to teach this course as far as dates, deadlines, and the schedule failed. :: Fairly effective. It was obvious that this was his first time teaching but with more experience the effectiveness will increase greatly. :: Greg is super intelligent and really knows what he is talking about. :: great lecturer, actually interesting. :: This guy is awesome! Really effective for learning the material for class. :: overall good instructor. :: good. :: He was very thorough in explaining problems and their applications. Made sure that everyone understood the concept and went over material multiple times. Provided enough content for us to the understand the overall picture for the use of problems covered in class. :: He manages to pretty seamlessly blend theory and application, so I'd say that's effective. :: I thought Greg did a great job for his first class. He was able to pick up when we didn't understand a topic and go over it again. His explanation of block diagrams was the best Ive had at WSU. What I liked about him the most was that you could tell he enjoyed his work and was a working engineering, he shared allot of his personal experience from the base which to me was exciting to hear about. :: He was a very fun instructor and really cared about student's learning. He sometimes went over material a little fast but this is expected in a Summer course"
3239,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Not too much of a strict syllabus, but nice that it is so flexible. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus, was flexible with students and worked with us to get the most out of us and help us succeed in his class. He was also to give real world insight to the industry that only someone with field experience has. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes,. :: yes. :: Yes, he gave us a syllabus at the beginning and stuck to it throughout the semester. :: Yes."
3240,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Always began on time and used a reasonable amount of time for material being covered. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he started class at 6 30 every time and used the entire time almost all the time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, on absent days, he made sure to have some of his experienced colleagues come in and conduct useful lectures. :: yes. :: Yes he was always there at 6:30. :: Yes. He was always there on time. Only had to cancel class once."
3241,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor helped encourage me to do well on the final and responded promptly whenever I had questions over e-mail. :: Great feedback directly on exam problems (loved it!) and payed attention to trends within the class (missed homework problems, common exam mistakes, overall misconception). Also, prompt homework grades and solutions were very helpful when learning the material. :: The instructor was able to relate course material to everyday life. :: He related every topic back to a real life use of the knowledge that we were covering, as well as going the extra step to make sure every single person in the class understood the material. :: yes. :: He would answer questions, give us real world examples as well as extra information for our own benefit. :: Gave real life examples from industry. :: Definietly. :: Went more in depth of what the topics of class were used for in âthe real world.â Was available to answer any questions. He asked how the exams went when we turned them in. :: neutral. :: enthusiasm. :: He seemed to genuinely care about each students understanding of the content, provided more feedback than just grades on the exams. :: He taught theory, went over book problems and then discussed applications. :: He would take the time to build models before class and use them in his lecture to better explain topics. :: He was always willing to answer questions, and helping people understand the concepts"
3242,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Kinda tangential during lecture but always has a point, which again sparks interest and keeps me intrigued about the material being discussed. Also helps me picture ""what"" we are actually solving for. :: He communicated well. :: Very effectively. :: effectively in both cases. :: He was great about communication once he got a wright state email.. and he was good about sending us the class homework and test information even without the pilot page that was never made for him. :: Very effectively once Wright state got his account set up. :: When he was finally given an email address (3 weeks into the semester), it was super easy to get a hold of him. :: Very effective. :: neutral. :: eh. :: Very effective, he made sure to communicate through email of any announcements. :: It seemed like he was never given access to pilot, but he was quick in his response time for emails so that made up for it. :: The administration, or whoever handles pilot really dropped the ball for this class because we never had a pilot page for this class. Greg said the administration kept giving him the run around to getting pilot up and running and after half the semester went by he gave up and we had to resort to email. :: Sent out emails with homework assignments and answered emails promptly"
3243,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- The lectures often took unexpected turns to topics not on the curriculum. :: Very well organized, wish we had homework assignments posted earlier though (while we were learning the content). :: Yes. :: Yes, the course had an excellent flow from topic to topic. :: mostly, sometimes we would get off track, but I would say getting off topic was ok because it was still at least useful information about engineering (even though it was not directly class material). :: Yes, he was a little scattered at the beginning, but he settled in and had good lectures that kept the students awake and paying attention. :: Yes. :: Yes. Wish we could have had lecture slides or printed notes for easier understanding. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, very well organized. :: yes. :: Since there was no pilot it wasn't organized as well as it should have been but for the most part I knew what was expected and when it was due. The in class lectures followed the book pretty good. :: I believe so he had examples he wanted to go over prepared ahead of time. Sometimes he talked about other things but they were all related to engineering and applications of what we were learning"
3244,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Hard for him to schedule office hours for an evening summer course, but was reasonably available when needed. Also difficult for him to get a Pilot page running, but still got our materials to us regardless. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes he was always will to come before or stay after class to answer questions as well as answer them online. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, I had to email him  a few times and he was very quick with a response. :: yes. :: He provided us his contact info but I never used it. :: Yes always. His office hours were during a different time but he was always willing to answer questions trough email or after class"
3245,Gregory Russell,2018 Summer,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- The course got better as the semester progressed (organization and time management). Very interesting material and loved his presentation (real world examples rather than cookie-cutter ""on paper"" work). :: Keep everything the same for any future classes. :: Pilot would have been nice to have to keep track of hw grades. :: Wright State needs to figure out their summer exam week shit so students don't have back to back exams for 3.5 hours straight, where the classes are already taught at an accelerated rate. Also telling a professor they can't move an exam up by one class period is BS, Slater. Just because its summer semester doesn't mean the classes are easier nor that the students have more time to study for them because they aren't taking 12+ hours. During any other semester there would be some break allowed. For this semester there was 10 minutes between the classes, which are in different rooms for exams. :: Anything that went wrong this semester had nothing to do with Greg or his teaching ability. It was the department and the lack of communication given to a brand new adjunct professor. The beginning of the semester was really bad and hectic because the department drug their feet on getting him the proper tools to succeed in teaching us. It was also frustrating to the students to find out that this class didn't end until the 26th. All semester, Greg mentioned that the semester ended the 19th which is what he was told starting out. 99% of our class is also taking Heat Transfer which is directly before this class so everyone is a little frustrated that at the end of the semester we are now informed that we will have back to back final exams on the same day because the department says that we aren't allowed to change the schedule even though it would have GREATLY benefited the students in both classes. These are 2 difficult classes needed for a majority of students who are hoping to start capstone in the fall. Summer classes are also ran differently when it comes to final exams than other semesters. This also lets us have LESS time to take our finals and also less time between the finals than we would originally have had if it was fall or spring. Greg was a great professor and I do not think it was fair for him to be so misinformed or treated the way he was. :: The last homework set is a bear. It was confusing even if the person stepping in for the few lectures tried to help us. :: nope. :: Greg is a super nice guy and laid back. Very funny and extremely smart. WSU should employ him full time. :: Great semester, would definitely take another class with you given the chance. :: He was a really good instructor and I enjoyed this class a lot! It was just a shame he was gone on vacation for 2 weeks. His first replacement wasn't really good at explaining the content."
3246,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very helpful and caring. :: very effective
3247,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes. :: Yes
3248,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes
3249,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- planned labs that use common knowledge from class in real world applications. :: Fine
3250,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 5,How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- did okay. deadlines should have been set at beginning and not in the middle of the semester. :: Fine
3251,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 6,Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes. :: Yes
3252,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes"
3253,Allen Jackson,2018 Summer,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no"
3254,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective instructor from the viewpoint of graduate level student. Dr. Camberos understands the course topic very well from an applicable sense and is able to make the relation to real-life situations easily. This helps from the standpoint of a student who would be interested in focusing on this topic in the workforce someday. :: I think he was quite effective. :: He is very knowledgeable, but wants you to learn a majority of the content on your own. :: Dr. Camberos is an extremely knowledgeable and effective instructor when it comes to Hypersonic Flows"
3255,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, for the most part. He wants the students to understand the information he is presenting, though doesn't want the students to stress based on grades. The course is taught more like a ""workshop"" instead of a submission-critical course, which alleviates the stress that comes from most classes in grad-school. :: Yes. :: When he did get the homework graded he did. :: Yes"
3256,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, the instructor made full use of the course time, and sometimes even extended his teaching past the given time if necessary. :: Yes. :: Yes and Yes. :: Yes"
3257,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- The instructor assigned a course project the we, the students, could choose from a wide variety of topics to work on as long as they were Hypersonics related. This aided in showing interest in what we, the students, thought was unique about the course. Dr. Camberos assisted in giving us feedback every step along the way. :: He has a unique background coming from a position at AFRL and so he was able to bring a perspective of someone who is on the ""frontlines"" of this field. This made the class more interesting. Also, I really enjoyed that he uploaded and pointed to vast amounts of supplementary material. :: He is very excited about the topics he teaches. :: Yes"
3258,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Dr. Camberos is on a personal name-to-name basis with all of his students and isn't afraid to send text messages or emails as appropriate to his students in regards to the course. He also is readily available to take questions as they are given to him. :: Very effectively. :: Well. :: Very effectively, lots of emails as well as text reminders."
3259,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- They followed the syllabus that was set up during the beginning of the course very well, and the information taught during the lectures was well organized by both the book and his standards. :: Yes. :: I wish he would do more stuff on the board during class to keep the class engaged. Sometimes I think he tries to cover too much and it it hard to keep up without the interaction. :: Yes"
3260,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes, I already answered a question that was very similar to this. :: Yes. Though I wish there were some slotted time once a week during which we could schedule an appointment to talk about the content. :: Yes. :: Yes"
3261,Jose Camberos,2018 Summer,ME 7400,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I do not. Glad I had the opportunity to be a part of not just one, but two of Dr. Camberos' courses!. :: I think the course could be improved slightly if the pace of the course was leveled out through the semester. I think we spent too much time at the beginning of the class on compressible flow review/intro material while we were rushing through later chapters. I understand that certain things had changed through the semester and this isn't necessarily Dr. Camberos' fault but I thought I would add it as a suggestion. I am glad we got to touch on the more advanced topics at the end of the book."
3262,Sheng Li,2016 Fall,ME 2210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Sheng Li is a highly intelligent man who has an efficiently structured itinerary for his lectures. He is very clear on what is expected of his students there are no suprise materials given in homework or exams. :: Very effective in delivering in class material. :: He was mildly effective to the students understanding. most of his lectures consisted of an outline followed by several examples which i enjoyed. :: Very. :: Dr. Li is an effective teacher.

3263,Sheng Li,2016 Fall,ME 2210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Sheng Li stuck to the syllabus like glue, and if there were changes he would let you know well in advance. Also, he understood the students level of knowledge, pushing us just enough that we were able to learn without being overwhelmed. He curved fairly and went over in detail what we needed to do in order to improve. :: Yes. :: he was fair to his syllabus with reasonable flexibility. :: Yes. :: Yes, graded very fairly. :: Yes. :: Yes.

3264,Sheng Li,2016 Fall,ME 2210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Class began on time +-5min and would usually go to time. On occasion he would let us out early or late depending on how long the problem was that we were reviewing. I can say for a fact that he used lecture time wisely (I have a crazy amount of notes to prove it.). :: Yes. :: it was always on time or just a few minutes after. class often let out a little early though. :: Yes. :: He always showed up right on time at 440 and used whole class period 90% of the time (maybe let us go 10 minutes early a day or two). :: Yes. :: Yes.

Approach to solving engineering problems was clearly defined and demonstrated by practice problems for real world applications.  All lectures ended with a conclusion of what to expect in real-life scenarios and what is expected of us for the course. :: The instructor was very effective in teaching the course with clear helpful examples and notes that helped in overall understanding of the subject. :: Overall Dr. Li was a very very god teacher. However, he could greatly improve by not allowing 3 kids not to ask him 1,000,000 STUPID questions every class. The rest of the class is there to learn to, and these kids trying to mess everything up is really not cool. :: Very good. :: He is very good. :: Good ye. :: Yes. :: Being very friendly in explaining doubts. :: Good. :: He is an excellent professor.

Some of the material was very complex, but he reassured us we will understand it and see it again.  Come exam time, it turned out I did understand it.  He was very personable, and the lectures were relaxed.  This is conducive to learning this sort of material. :: This class was extremely boring but went over a lot of information and did a good job of doing so. :: Both professors were well organized. :: I only had Jared for half of the semester due to his sickness.

3286,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Not effective. :: Fair to poor. :: Effective professor. :: Instructor was not very effective due to poor lectures and poor course materials. :: Dr. Jackson was effective as the instructor of this course. :: The instructor was helpful in my understanding of the subject. :: Not good, can learn way more about the subject if you just read the book yourself. Did not learn anything from him. :: Better than what I heard from last semester. Didn't use excel at all and didn't example problems from the book. Problem is the example problems are nowhere near as hard as the homework. It's impossible to do the homework because they use equations we don't even touch on in class. One particular assignment the TA told us that no one even got a part of the problem correct and there was 5 parts to it. They also said that the problem wasn't in the scope of the class. He's a nice guy and exams were not horrible. Lab reports are horrible due to not understanding the material from the course and not knowing what's going on in the lab. :: He did a lot of examples in class and explained concepts. :: teaches straight from book (not very effective). :: Given the circumstances, he had a hard time teaching the material well. The book that he was teaching from was brand new to him as this was the first semester that he has used it. There are a lot of mistakes in the book itself. The material is very confusing and the lessons conveyed in the book are taught in a manner that might not be the most effective for undergraduate students. Also, we started from the middle of the book and skipped around in the chapters, so that made learning the material even more difficult.  I do not believe that Dr. Jackson had solid and effective teaching methods going into the semester. I do believe he can be a great instructor in other subjects though. He is a very nice guy, just wasn't a great instructor in this class. :: Somewhat effective. :: good. :: He was generally effective and provided easy to understand explanations and examples. :: He gave a good effort. The topic of the class is pretty boring. It is hard to stay engaged talking about statistic distribution. :: instructor was not fair to all student. Also, he brings problem that has been solved by the manual solution that is not solved well and not based on what we cover such as formulas, and equations. Therefore it was hard to follow and keep up with the class. :: good. :: Yes. :: He takes pride in his work and he really does want the student to understand the subject. Some sections are difficult to understand and he tries to spend as much time as possible on them, but I was still having issues with a few. :: Could be more effective. :: Gd. :: Not  a good teaching because of the new book the instructor sometimes skip some material because its new book. :: He was good at teaching a topic that did not make too much sense. :: He was okay. Felt like we started in the middle of subjects where a general knowledge was needed before we could start problems. For example, started statistics without going over what the symbols meant and it became more confusing than it should have been. Walked away from the class still not really knowing what I should have learned. :: yes. :: NOT BAD. :: he is good, but I think he need to explain everything in better way. :: It was a bit hard to follow in class. I would probably have benifitted from some more specific examples, not necessarily the ones in the book. It was a little better towards the end when he started using slideshows. :: He was okay in terms of effectiveness.  The material itself is pretty tedious and the book isn't that great at explaining the concepts, so I think he did a decent job at making the material simple and straightforward."

The grading scheme was a bit harsher than other classes, but was plenty fair. Mostly just took a learning curve on my end. :: He followed his syllabus and made fair homework requests. :: Not exactly, because he does not evaluate the exams equally where he differentiate between students. A such a problem happen to me in the second exam where my friend's answer and approach was completely wrong, and he got higher grade than mine where my approach was right and the mistake was when i plugged the numbers in the calculator i missed putting the right numbers which made my final answer wrong.

3289,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By just being physically present, I suppose. :: Provided multiple examples and real-life applications. :: Yes. :: The instructor would routinely ask if there were any questions and answer them promptly if there were.  If a concept was misunderstood, he would explain it to ensure that we understood. :: He posted some detailed PowerPoints on Pilot so we could look at them. :: answering all questions. :: Not very well, it was very dry material, that might just be the nature of the material though. With that said, I don't think he is to blame for this. :: Made sure everyone understood what was going on in class. :: He encouraged participation and gave us clear connections to the real world applications of the course material. :: He would ask about our work experience and make examples based of the feedback. :: When i started the semester I was so anxious about the course but lost my interest after the second exam and just want to pass. :: Good. :: Yes. :: He was very interested in making sure we understood the topics and tried to convey all of the topics so that we could understand. :: Difficult information. :: Gd. :: the instructor was very good about this, really great guy. :: Answered questions and clarified problems we had with examples in class. :: yes. :: GOOD. :: good. :: He was helpful in and out of class and willing to help individually. :: He asked us questions and gave us in class problems to solve and answer to see if we were grasping the concepts."
3290,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He did not communicate well. In emails he seemed to misunderstand what was being asked or said. :: Poorly. Getting a proper answer to a question usually involved two or three attempts and sifting through a lot of confusion. :: Very well. :: Communicated fine. :: Dr. Jackson communicated well. :: He would email us about changes to the syllabus, homework assignments, and changes to due dates in order to keep us informed. :: Good. :: homework was not posted on pilot which makes no sense. :: When I went into his office hours, he taught me more than I would learn in the classroom environment. He made sure that I understood the material and tried to relate it to other real-world applications so that it was easier to understand. :: Somewhat effective. :: Very effectively. :: He had helpful office hours and was quick to respond to email. :: good. :: Yes. :: He was very good at responding. :: not effective enough. :: Gd. :: He was good at both. :: Good. Sent emails reminding us of lab reports due and due dates being moved. Emailed some of the homework assignments. :: yes. :: GOOD. :: good. :: In the classroom, he was a little hard to follow sometimes, but outside the classroom, very eaSy to understand."

After the first midterm it was apparent that we only really needed to bring the homework solutions to the exam in order to do well. Lecture rarely contributed to learning. :: Yes. :: No, the course texts was poor, lectures provided very little useful information, and class examples were not very legible. :: Yes. :: The lectures were a little unorganized sometimes.  There were also difficulties with the computer system frequently, which hinder the lectures.  Overall, the material was still taught in an informative matter with lots of practice problems. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. He adjusted some of the ordering of chapters as they were presented in the textbook and it made more sense that way. :: for the most part. :: somewhat agree. :: Yes. :: Yes there was always a clear direction we were going in lecture. :: Yes. :: Gd. :: they seemed structured, but sometimes lectures were confusing. :: Yes.

It's unhelpful overall with many irrelevant examples. :: No. :: no. :: Dr, Jackson is a great and respectable person, he is very nice and I like him a lot. He just was not the most effective instructor for this course.

Thanks. :: Yes. :: Gd. :: Really great guy. :: The book was vague and I felt it left out a lot of important information relevant to what was going on.

He would go through the lessons fairly fast and it was hard to keep up. :: good. :: He clearly explained the requirements of the labs. :: GOOD. :: He was effective in going through the labs and showing us what needed to be done.

3301,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: It was a solid and straightforward class.  I think it'd be nice if the lab manual was a little more illustrative of procedures so that if students wanted to review outside of class on their own they could.  For example, the Design Tasks in the ME 1040 courses did a good job of outlining what the objective was and gave instruction on how to use Solidworks to produce the different designs.  It would be helpful if the lab had something similar for the Labview software."
3302,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 3600L,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- meh. :: The instructor was helpful in my understanding of the subject and how to complete the labs.

3311,Allen Jackson,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No, you can have all requirements such as calculations and technical results completed as required, but he will do his best to find a grammar mistake to take off at least 10 to 25% of the grade! Even English courses don't do that! I got straight As in all of my English classes. How can English be more important than calculations and technical results in a Mech and Mat Test Lab! I get it if results don't make sense. However, he takes off points because of minor errors like spelling mistakes!. :: yes. :: Yes,. :: well we only got 2 grades back before the end of the year. sooo the syllabus was find but there was no way we could change the way we did things so our grades we had no idea the whole time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: yes"

He made clear what was due at what time and how we were to accomplish it. :: Effective and helpful. :: the professor is too attractive to the lecture . his voice is too clear for the class and prepared his material well. :: He is one of the most knowledgeable instructor in the WSU. he helps me to set the problem in the Engineering method for solve. :: Outstanding. Made great use of time and policies were fair and oriented toward student success. :: Dr. Young is a very goofy guy, but seems to genuinely care about our learning.

He cares about machinability, hardness, and mechanical properties rather than just the theory of them. :: yes. :: Yes. :: He gave us the information we needed to do the lab then assigned lab reports. :: By giving enough time to complete the experiments and explained stuffs when needed"
3354,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 2600,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Needs to work on his email timing and responses but he was easy to find in person. :: quite well. :: usually didn't know what was happening in the lab, usually had to refer to other professors in the Materials department. :: Yes. :: He knew what was needed for each lab and was available in the machine shop if we had questions. :: Not bad"
3355,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 2600,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: not really. Most of us could have spent a week less on the 2nd lab and 2 weeks less on the 3rd lab so we could have done the 4th lab. If the schedule was more set in stone, we could have gotten through all 4 labs. The 1st lab will always take the longest because of teaching all the steps seperately but the other labs were very quick, once we learned the few new steps. :: Sometimes. :: Content was organized, the lab was not. Some students cannot put things back in place. Or clean them. :: Yes"
3356,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 2600,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- absolutely. :: yes. :: yes. Always in his office. :: Never tried. :: He was frequently available in the machine shop. :: Yes"
3357,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 2600,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- We had to spend a lot of time outside the designated class time. I personally planned my wees to only be in class during that specific time. When we had to spend 3+ hours outside of class for the 3rd lab, it was hard to fit it into my schedule. :: A lot of us wouldn't mind a metallography 2. Do the labs we didn't get to and work with other metals beyond brass and steel. :: No"
3358,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- not effective at all, class was boring to all students and he did not know the material and couldn't answer simple questions. :: Bad instructor. :: he very nice but not the best teacher. :: Mr. Lawless was very effective as the instructor of this course. :: ok. :: great. :: he gives nice lecture and has good explanation for the material. :: Very good. :: John is a super nice guy who cares more about ensuring we have useful knowledge than he does about us memorizing useless formulas from an outdated book.  He has decades of experience and I trust his words more than i trust the words of someone who overcomplicates formulas for the sake of selling a textbook, (the author).  If there was something he disagreed with from the book using his experience as an engineer in a heavily machining based environment, he wasn't afraid to let us know so we had two sides of the story, so to speak. :: wonderful teacher. :: he was pretty good. :: Effective. :: Gd. :: great instructor and good teaching. :: Good. :: The overall effectiveness was good. The lectures could be a little less than exciting at times, but it is hard to make the subject taught too exciting. :: THE PROFFESSOR IS REALLY HELPFUL IN ALL ASPECTS. :: yes. :: good instructor. :: Yes. :: very effective. :: a. :: 55. :: Good. I felt like the book was a great hindrance to the lecture. I think I remember it being mentioned that the book was the required reading for this class. I didn't like it. A lot of things math and formula related were followed up by ""this isn't used in the real world"" or something like that. I wish the lecture could have complemented the lab a bit more on operation the the machines, what to look for when running them, the practical side to it. The book was a nightmare and trying to teach out of it even more so. Overall I felt that many useful concepts were taught and the real world was a bit more revealed in the class. Good class to bring the classroom engineering to reality. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: I don't feel like I learned a lot from lecture. I don't believe that's it is Lawless fault I just don't believe the class should have a lecture portion. :: class was good. book was hard to understand. :: John has years of machining experience and used it to help our class learn the basics of machining. He also taught us things that will help in our careers that we wouldn't get from the book could because of his time as a machinist. :: good teacher"
3359,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 2,Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- No where is the hw. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: wonderful teacher. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Gd. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: YES. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: Yes. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: Not sure yet haven't received anything but midterm grade back. :: yes. :: Everything expected from us was laid out in the syllabus and we were graded just as the syllabus stated. :: yes
3360,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: we would get out early but i have no problem with that. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: wonderful teacher. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Gd. :: Yes. :: Yes, although he did not drag it out once we had covered the material needed, which was nice. :: YES. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: Normally started on time. Lectures got a little shorter as the semester progressed. Wish we would have spent a bit more time on explaining and working through Chapter 6 and the formulas, the cost analysis stuff, there was a lot to it and we sort of rushed through. :: . :: yes. :: GOOS. :: yes always on time and for the most part used full time. :: yes. :: yes"

He even set up a tour with a local company which specializes in machining and fabrication. He attended all of the labs, even with a bum foot, and he was very willing to answer any questions we had in detail. :: BY TEACHING THE CLASS IN A FRIENDLY MANNER. :: yes. :: get some samples in class to see it in real world. :: yes. :: 5. :: Answered questions, went back over material to make sure it was thoroughly covered. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: N/a. :: yes. :: good"
3362,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- No. :: classroom time was not but the lab was very effective. :: Mr. Lawless communicated well. :: very well. :: Good. :: very effectively. :: wonderful teacher. :: he was always available for help. :: Effective. :: Gd. :: Very well. :: Communication could have been a little better, but it was not bad. Pilot was not organized as well as it could have been, but I was able to access everything I needed to. :: yes. :: try his best. :: very. :: 5. :: Good, emails were sent reminding us of the trip and when lab was canceled, etc. :: Wan not bad. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: well. :: easy to communicate with and quick with replies. :: good"
3363,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- No. :: no the slides where never organized but probably because had not teached the class before. :: The course seemed to be a bit disorganized. The book probably contributed to this. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: wonderful teacher. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he organized his lectures and powerpoints very well. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: Lectures seemed a to be rushed to put together, a few times said he didn't have enough time to prepare the Powerpoint and wasn't sure what was in it. As a result, would go off of personal experience which was typically better than the book material. :: Not really. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: No not really felt thrown together last minute. :: yes. :: yes"
3364,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- No. :: i be leave so. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: wonderful teacher. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was always open to help even outside of office hours. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: Yes. :: . :: yes. :: GOOD. :: yes. :: yes"
3365,John Lawless,2016 Fall,ME 4870,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Organize your work and lucture. :: The guy that was filling in for him for the lab part i think was named Denny he was very good at helping and explaining how get best part and would do good job explaining everything. :: Most of our labs were taught by Dennis Weber. Mr. Weber did an outstanding job instructing the lab. He was not only very knowledgeable but very patient. I enjoyed the lab very much and found it to be beneficial to learning the course material. :: no. :: John is a great professor that understands that certain classes shouldn't just be another math class, and that practical knowledge and experience trumps all.  From what I've heard, Dr. Lieh's machining classes end up with less practical knowledge, worse grades, and even a lesser knowledge of the ridiculous concepts from the textbook. :: wonderful teacher. :: no. :: No. :: No. :: good man. :: no. :: 5. :: The book was poorly written and confusing. A few cases where formulas appeared to conflict, either they did or were for different things but not clarified, formulas appearing out of thin air. Really hard to follow and hindered lecture since they were taught out of the book. Would have like to hear more of the personal story side. :: . :: yes. :: NO. :: Thanks for making the class enjoyable!. :: sorry for that, but the classroom is very boring"

I feel like I got a false sense of how fast machining can go since we used softer metals. It would have been nice to see the response of a wider range of materials to machining. Maybe modify this project to have a steel handle perhaps? I know there is limited time and funds but something to think about. Really enjoyed Denny in the shop and the time to ""pick his brain"" so to speak about general machining. Very interesting and useful."

He treats every student in his class equally which makes every student esp International students feel good . I come from a country where teaching and education system is completely different to what it is here. Initially we all students faced issues in understanding the education system here and the subject. But Professor Wolff  understood our weakness, constantly helped us by repeating the topics, conducting interactive sessions, giving additional work assignments and  conducting additional recitation classes (where in we could ask our doubts and get them cleared immediately). :: good"

3429,J. Wolff,2016 Fall,ME 4330,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Some exams were longer than the time given to complete them.  Giving a prerequisite exam was not beneficial for the students, 2 classes worth of material is too much to open endedly test students over. :: HE FIRST NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND ON WHAT LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE ARE ALL THE STUDENTS ARE. THEN HE NEEDS TO PREPARE THE SYLLABUS AND TEACHING CRITERIA BASED ON THIS. AND ALSO GIVE EXAMS BASED ON THIS.

Even if you're scatterbrained sometimes, I still learn a hell of a lot in your classes!. :: I enjoyed the class very much! The only complaint I have is concerning the homework. The professor didn't look at the problems before he assigned them, so sometimes I felt the homework assignments were out of scope. In other words, the assignments took too many hours to work to be considered homework. Some of them should have been given as half semester projects, for example. Other than that, I really liked the course! The professor explained stuff very well, and overall I'm very happy with the course!"
3438,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 3360,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- He could make the online notes easier to follow, but where's the fun in that? At least he has notes online. He is an effective instructor. :: he is a very good instructor, Actually he is the instructor that i have so far in the university. :: over all he is a good instructor it was easy to learn from him. :: Dr. Menart was available to give us guide in Heat transfer. :: Very thorough in examples, sometimes kind of quick through notes though.

Clear with examples and explanations of topics. :: Good. :: best teacher. :: Very effective one of the best professors ive had. :: yes. :: tough grader. :: Genuinely concerned about student learning. :: I am not a fun of one note, because I couldn't keep up in class and going back to review the lectures seemed to slow me down and it was a pain at times. I know that this was for distant learning and stuff but I just like the marker board the best. :: great teacher he made me love heat transfer and I really enjoyed the class because of him. :: Good instructor, but he make mistakes while writing note for class. :: Gd. :: He is a great teacher. :: Excellent. :: Fairly effective. :: yes. :: Dr. Menart loves what he does, and he made us love heat transfer, he is a very good instructor. I will definitely take him again. :: Not really.

I appreciate you work and time. :: No. :: I thought the MATLAB project was brutal. I think I spent more time trying to figure out the coding part than the actual problem which resulted in me turning in a project that wasn't finished. Which it probably makes me look like I didn't do anything or start on it early, but I had a lot of projects this semester and when I did start on this project I was doing it wrong. I started to do the problem like how I would on paper because I didn't know how to do the while and if statements because ME students typically dont solve problems like that and I think MATLAB should be incorporated into the program more. We dont use MATLAB, because we cant use it on tests and most of the time we cant use it on our homework problems, so its pointless and a waste of time (At the time its a waste of time lol, but in terms of the future its not a waste of time.). I am not mad at you Menart, I'm mad at myself because I know my program sucks and I really wanted to do good and I didn't. It was just frustrating because I knew what to do but I couldn't do it in MATLAB, but I learned alot from it and I glad you made us do it and I just hope my grade on it is decent and not a F becuase initally I wrote out 16 equations by hand just to have to redo it all over again. LOL. :: I really enjoyed having him as my teacher i wish i would have taken him earlier in other classes I will really miss him. :: No. :: Gd. :: No. :: Dr.Menart, thanks a lot for video capturing your lectures for without them I wouldn't pass this class. Please, don't stop using this method for your next classes. :: he try his best to make sure the materials is clear enough in a way (step by step). :: Dr. Menart is the best at what he does. :: . :: best teacher. :: nope. Project was painful"
3446,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good. :: Dr. Menart sets a very high standard for professors in which most other professors fall short. :: Simplifies the concepts very well.  Very prompt in grading and getting back with you.  Good Professor.  Tests over qualitative as well as quantitative to cover the full spectrum. :: In overall, Dr. Menart was in love with this subject, that he made it easy. :: good. :: Dr. Menart is one of the most influential and knowledgable professors in the ME dept. He covers just enough to have a decent grasp on the qualitative concepts and reviews quantitative examples each topic. :: Excellent. :: Material was presented in a clear and organized manner. All concepts were covered thoroughly. Overall Dr. Menart does a very good job. :: he is very effective in his way teaching in the class and drawing attention from the students."
3447,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the exams remained on the same days and overall very organized class.  Got behind a little in lectures but always extended hw due date so it was okay. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Syllabus and real-class-expectations are nearly equivalent. However, do expect to fall a bit behind the syllabus schedlue due to extrapolations in class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes., he did evaluate the work based on the expectations"

This was difficult this semester due to the close spacing of class periods. I found myself struggling to get to class on time and Dr. Menart often had a hard time getting there more than a couple minutes before class started. Dr. Menart does a good job using the class time in valuable ways and rarely lets class out early. :: yes., i thoroughly enjoyed attending his classes, they are very interactive and informative"
3449,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- In class discussions were always built around the material and questions were often asked to the class to test our comprehension and retention of material. :: Yes. :: good. :: Absolutely, no other teacher has been as interested in their student's learning. :: Always available for questions. :: In particular Dr. Menart encourages classroom participation and asking questions."
3450,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: Very effectively. :: I only went to the office once, but have no complaints. :: Yes. :: freqently. :: In class, Menart performed well in response to questions. However, he sometimes did drag on a bit too long on tangential subjects. Though informational, the pace of the class doesn't allow for these types of side tracks. :: very well. :: In class Dr. Menart is very clear in his communication. He makes himself available outside of class by appointment or through office hours and generally is always willing to answer any questions you have. :: DR. MENART is a very effective person., he is very communicative in and out of the class. he sends emails for any information that's not been discussed in the class and his class would be an interactive session."
3451,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, most organized notes. :: Yes. :: very much so. :: Yes. :: yes. :: For the most part, I do wish that the one note screen was not scrolled so quickly down, or t least extended either vertically or horizontally to see the previous notes. (They do quickly). Though, I have to admit the recordings can make up for this; however, it is cumbersome. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes they are very well organised. he has his own style of dealing with things. that's the best part."
3452,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Again, for the most part Menart was responsive during hours and appointments. But he is not quite as timely as other profs in email response. Perhaps responding via mobile device would help? But I understand the urge to tune out work and school after hours. No hard feelings at all. :) Just a constructive suggestion. :: yes. :: Yes. :: he is available at all time and he is very gentle in his  response."
3453,James Menart,2016 Fall,ME 4530,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Continue your method of teaching. It works. :: Dr. James Menart was one of the best instructors in Wright State. :: no. :: Menart is the most indefensible professor on Energy Engineering in the entire university. His mentoring and lectures have truly impacted many students' lives."

Fair grader. :: Very effective. :: It was hard to understand the lectures and I feel like I had to teach most of the material to myself. :: Professor Mian is a wonderful professor and one of the nicest professors I have had the privilege of taking. He taught the class through examples and actual ""doing"" of the math portions of the class, which is beyond helpful in class that's more math oriented than logic. :: very ineffective. felt like i had to teach myself a majority of the material. :: good. :: Well. :: He's a nice guy, but is somewhat sporadic on teaching. :: Great instructor but more problem examples would be helpful. :: He was effective at teaching the class however on a few occasions his English caused some confusions. :: He was good. :: Very effective. :: good. :: fairly effective. :: Examples were relatively clear and easy to understand. His explanations were generally sufficient to complete the coursework. :: Not the best proffessor I have ever had, but his tests are fair and he might be the nicest person on campus. He honestly felt bad if we didn't do well on the exams. Great person. :: Professor Mian is a very good instructor. He explained the material very clearly to the class and always checked to make sure that the class understood what he had just said. His grading was very fair for exams and he always treated everyone with respect in regards to concerns or questions that they might have had for him. :: bit hard to understand but was sill able to teach the material very well. :: he really wants to help students learn, although he can be tough to understand and his notes are confusing. :: Great course. :: very effective. :: He was not very effective at teaching the course material. :: A bit scattered, but effective at the same time. :: good. :: Tried to explain everything as best he could. When the class was struggling with a concept, he would spend extra time on it. Many professors aren't willing to do that. :: good. :: the instructor covered all the material in the book and simplified in his own notes which was helpful to get straight to the point of the course. :: good. :: On a scale of 0-9, Dr. Mian's effective would be a 6. :: wish to have seen more example problems. Many times we didn't know what was going to be on the weekly quizzes. Many times we were rushed to do the quizzes because he gave them so close to the end of class.

He tried to make sure we understood the material, however, he was not the greatest teacher. :: Along with being smart and intelligent in his subject, he had a sense of humor and a great personality that made you want to listen to him.

3462,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- he is good instructor and he taught us well. :: Ahsan Has a lot of heart and attempts to teach the class effectively, however I struggled in learning the material due to his frequent pauses to check his work, as well as the speed at which he wrote and the font size. overall he was a fair instructor however I would not recommend his classes. :: very good. :: Instructor was somewhat effective. Lectures were not the easiest to comprehend. :: I felt the lectures were not very effective, I spent most of my time learning from the book and the online notes are very hard to follow for me. :: He tried to teach us everything we needed to know and knew what he was doing most of the time. Sometimes though he did not know what was going on and stumbled around on problems a lot. :: class work isn't always related to the homework. doesnt know how to do some of the homework that is assigned to us and gets lost in problems that he has the solutions to in his hands. :: I don't think he ever comes to class prepared, its almost like he shows up and the first thing to come into his head he just starts teaching about it with absolutely no plan of action. :: He is very effective.  He does a lot of example problems and answers students' questions. :: Tends to not be organized. :: not effective, examples were poorly explained and more often then not left unfinished because either Mian got confused half way through or we were supposed to know how to do the rest despite not being taught the rest. :: Not effective. :: good. :: I felt like I did not learn anything new if this class. I also felt that there was a lack of organization or structure to the class, and was often confused about what we were learning, or how it was applied. :: Not very effective. :: Overall the lectures feel uncoordinated and unprepared.  The professor seems to dither and repeat himself a lot.  I and other students repeatedly feel unprepared for all homework assignments and exams. :: Not a good instructor just isn't good at getting he point a cross. :: Pretty effective, my only real complaint was that sometimes his teaching wouldn't match how things were set up in the course book. :: somewhat, seemed to be ""scattered"" during lecture. :: Great instructor. :: Very ineffective. He is very unclear in his lecturing. This is because of lack of direction, frequent mistakes (multiple per example typically), and not fully solving problems.  By lack of direction, I mean that it is not clear where he is going or what he is doing. Often times, he will pull an equation without telling us where it came from or why we are using it.  He makes many mistakes during example problems. These mistakes are typically a missed variable or exponent. These are easily fixed on the board, but not so easily fixed on paper, especially when the error was noticed only after a few steps. This sometimes renders multiple pages of notes useless. When I can fix a mistake in my notes, it usually takes a few minutes for me to fix the problem, in which time he has moved on.  It is very common for him to stop doing a problem halfway and move on to something else. The result of this is that I have a decent understanding of how to do a problem up to a certain point, then no clue after that point. :: he is a perfect professor in system dynamics. :: GOOD. :: I would describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor as very low.  I and many of my classmates felt lost for most of the class, as he did not effectively explain anything that he was speaking about.  There was very little actual teaching that went on in the lectures, almost no discussion of class materials.  Many times the professor seemed to be confused as to what he was doing, as well.  I will be leaving this class feeling like I have learned absolutely nothing about control systems. :: good. :: Lectures could use more structure in my opinion. :: So effective. It was unreal. Lectures were captivating. :: Great. :: Not very effective. I do not feel that the course as taught was a valuable use of my time. :: I had a hard time paying attention in his class. He was all over the place in his lectures and it made it hard to follow."
3463,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- yes he did. :: Ahsan graded fairly and I'm happily surprised with how I did in the course. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: All the work was evaluated fairly and accordingly to the syllabus for the course. :: yes. :: sure. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes i guess. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yeah he syllabus was fine. :: Yes, though more feedback on homework might have been nice. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: GOOD. :: I think so, I am not sure how I could say how he evaluated my work. :: yes. :: Yup, I took the test and he graded it as expected. :: Yes. :: yes. :: I don't think so. I somehow managed to get 50% on homework even though I had the same answers as other people."
3464,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: He started class on time most of the time and always used all of the class period. :: yes. :: sure. :: Yes. :: was occasionally a few minutes late and always seemed to go a couple minutes over our class time. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, although consistently switching between the white board and projector kills a lot of time. :: yup. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: GOOD. :: The instructor started the class mostly on time, though there were many times he had the class ""take a break"" while he tried to figure out what was going on, and regularly kept the class over time. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Very punctual. Full class was used. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes."
3465,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- he gave us a lot of life example and his teaching was good. :: he asked the class often for input on our understanding of the material. :: good. :: He had lots of examples and notes but he did not always know what some of them meant. :: yes. :: you can tell he wants his students to succeed but his teaching style doesn't help much. :: He answers my questions and explains concepts I don't understand. :: Not sure. :: he showed up to class. :: he didnt. :: yes. :: He was very nice. :: He does seem frustrated at the failed communication between his lectures and the students. :: yeah but just wasn't good at teaching. :: he would ask routinely during lecture about our understanding of the material. :: refresh all method needed to solve in this class. :: He was there. :: GOOD. :: I can't state any particular time that expressed an interest in my learning. :: good. :: Eagerly answered any questions posed. :: He answered questions. Seems insignificant but some profs lack even this simple skill to listen. :: Not very well. :: He did many examples, which I am very thankful for. He also posted all his notes online which is incredibly generous."
3466,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- very well in both. :: very well. :: Fine. :: Sometimes it was very easy to understand the material but sometimes he glanced over material very fast. :: yes. :: Very well. :: often sent emails out but sometimes did not give us ample time to see said emails. :: not effectively. :: not very effective. :: very poorly. :: very well. :: not very well at all. :: It was sometimes difficult to understand what he was saying, but he was open to requests for clarification. :: very. :: He did all the question that I need and if I did not understand something, he work hard to let the idea be clear to me. :: Well. :: GOOD. :: I feel that that the instructor couldn't get his ideas and lectures across very well.  He was not very clear when attempting to do example problems, as he had not really covered any material in a lecture.  The notes that were uploaded to pilot were of poor quality and difficult to read, and the lecture periods did not help the class with comprehension of the material. :: he is very good. :: Well. :: Easily reached at all times. :: Good. :: Not very effectively. It was frequently not clear what the objective of the material being covered in the course was. :: He was a very fast communicator."
3467,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- yes he was. :: the lectures seemed scattered and unrehearsed, however we covered the material on the syllabus. :: yes. :: Lectures were organized well but hard to understand. :: I felt the jumps through some logic were hard to follow. :: The content always seemed to start off with a direction at the beginning of class but then veered off in the end and got more unorganized. :: lectures not so organized. :: no, very little organization. :: Yes. :: No, He seemed to get caught up in his own examples and would need to take a minute to look them over again. :: no, the lectures were disjointed and random.  it seemed like someone else wrote them and this was Mian's first time reading through them. :: no. :: very poorly. :: sort of. :: Not entirely.  We did follow the basic structure of chapters out of the book as outlined on the syllabus, however the lectures themselves felt uncoordinated and unorganized.  The professor seemed to never notice when he began to go over a problem we had already done.. two other times.. :: not very not no. :: Sometimes the homework would cover applications of concepts that were not well covered in class, but this usually wasn't a problem. :: somewhat. :: yes. :: No. Lectures were horribly unorganized. I very rarely understood where we were at in an example problem or just in general teaching. He often bounced around on the whiteboard with no direction. :: GOOD. :: In my opinion, the content was not well organized.  The flow of the class skipped over chapters only to come back to them later, after we were already confused from not learning about the early chapters already. :: yes. :: Could have been better organized. :: yup. quizzes should be at beginning of class or randomly during class to prevent students from showing up just to take quiz. :: Yes. :: no. :: No, very unorganized and hard to follow."
3468,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: He was always in his office hours and willing to help. He also answered his emails very promptly. :: yes. :: Yes. :: never required office hours from him. :: didnt even bother trying to contact him. :: yes. :: yes, unfortunately he wasnt available right before class which was the only time I could make it. :: yeah. :: Yes, though I didn't use this much. :: yes. :: yes, he did respond me in office hours and even the emails. :: yes. :: GOOD. :: THere were office hours posted. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yup. :: Yes. :: Yes."
3469,Akm Mian,2016 Fall,ME 3210,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- no. :: Exams were tricky this year.  I felt the first one was reasonable, but long.  The second one felt a bit too hard for one question. :: A little more organization for the class would be helpful. Also not trying to shove to much material into one class session. :: no. :: Nice guy just doesnt seem well prepared to teach at times. :: He needs to work all the way through every problem unless it is very obvious how he got the answer. :: good guy but not a good teacher. :: very easy person to talk to, willing to work with each student. :: recommend this professor. :: I think a big part of the problems stated above is just general unpreparedness. He should sit down with Dr. Scott Thomas and adopt some of his teaching habits. The most helpful would be the prewritten notes that he rewrites during lecture. That way, Dr. Mian will not make nearly as many mistakes. It would be useful for him to give a very short breakdown of each example problem, i.e. what each step is and why we were doing it. He would have to stay focused on this area and take no more than 5 minutes.  Overall, I can tell Dr. Mian really cares about his students. His disorganization, however, is severely crippling his effectiveness. :: GOOD. :: I would avoid any other classes with this instructor if possible. :: nope. :: Thanks. :: If another professor were teaching I would retake the class. :: He genuinely wants everyone to pass, but his grading is off and his teaching is very unorganized."
3470,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- 6.5/10. :: I don't think there were enough examples similar to the homework for learning.  There was a large project, and the goals were not clearly specified until late in the project, causing some difficulty, but I still learned a lot. :: Perfect. :: good. :: Good yes. :: Dr. Farajian knew the material very well. He explained things clearly and in a well enough manner. :: average. :: He was able to deliver the lectures on time and give some projects to work in which helped in enhancing our knowledge. :: on a scale 5, I would rate 4.5. :: excellent. :: Very good. :: good. :: Did he really even teach us or were we self taught?  Lectures consisted of him writing out notes on the board that were just taken word for word from the book.  Any example problems were done when he ran out of ideas for the rest of the class time and just told the class to solve problem X.  Minimal guidance was offered by him either in class or out and with as little hw and in class problems as he gives you're left going into the exam having no clue what you were supposed to have learned or what you will be tested on. :: great teacher very enthusiastic about the class and taught by example."
3471,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- 9/10. :: The syllabus was not very detailed, but the two main concepts were covered. :: yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian was fair and based his grading as detailed in the course syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He did. :: yes he makes us to work more by which we have some good idea about the subject. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Based on the limited grades that we have received it truly feels like he just picks a grade out of a hat to assign to each student. :: Yes, the syllabus was followed precisely throughout the school year."
3472,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- 7/10. :: The professor was very frequently late.  So we lost some time in the beginning. :: yes he did. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Dr, Farajian was routinely 5 to 10 minutes late. Starting class on time was a rarity (if it even happened at all). Other then this the rest of the period was used in full. :: most of the times. :: Yes. :: Yes. He never wastes a minute. :: yes he utilises every minute. :: Yes. :: yes. :: There was not a single day this semester in which Dr. Farajian arrived to class on time.  The first day of class he showed up fifteen minutes late. :: Always early to class to prepare, never behind schedule. Class time was used productively and the full class period was used"
3473,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- 6.5/10. :: It felt like we were somewhat on our own to learn the topics. :: very well. :: good. :: Yes. :: Dr. Farajian seemed interested in the material and I believe that he wanted all to take the same interest and get something from the material. I had Dr. Farajian for a previous class and it was clear he did not find the material interesting and it was reflected in the way he taught the material in class. This was a vast improvement. :: good. :: By relating the concept with some lively examples. :: yes. :: Concept was near to the expectations. :: good. :: Encouraged questions all the time in class and was always open to us contacting him outside of class.
3474,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- 6/10. :: very well. :: good. :: Good. :: Dr. Farajian communicated okay in the classroom. However, when it came to assigning homework and project material he was very late in posting the material. Some time a homework would be assigned at 11PM on a Saturday night, and would be due the next class period which was a Tuesday. If you did not check pilot daily you could find yourself in a bad situation. :: frequently. :: He was able to communicate effectively in and out of the class by arranging some special sessions in labs t guide. :: He is available whenever requested and helped us a lot in the labs as well. :: very well, he responds to emails also as quickly. :: Good. :: good. :: Regarding the final project.  He gave very poor instruction, all verbal or written requirements, as to what he wanted done.  Simply assigned an article to each team and said this is your team task.  Each week as we neared closer and closer to the end of the semester he seemed to realize that he ""forgot"" to include some form of the project that completely redefines how we have to go about completing it. :: Very prompt at answering and stopped for ever question to help everyone understanding"
3475,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- 8/10. :: Okay. :: yes they were. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part Dr. Farajian lectured and presented the material well and in an organized fashion. There were situations where the material could have been presented in a more orderly fashion as sometimes the way the material was presented did not really build on each other, but were just stand alone topics. The it would switch back to the topic being discussed prior. :: fair. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No real organization issues here. :: The course content and lectures were extremely organized. This was very helpful."

3477,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7520,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- 49/70 --> C. :: he is great. :: no. :: No. :: In my own personal opinion I felt that the class in general was good. However, I felt like the second half of the course on Hydrogen storage was lack luster. 50% of the time was spent in the lab learning how to use Gauss View. I felt like it was a waste and the time would have been better spent learning about actual storage methods rather then messing in a lab and using a program that I will never use again. In addition Dr. Farajian would provide example problems in class, but make us solve them ourselves in class and not show us how to solve the problems. While I understand that this was a 7000 level class and some self teaching is required, I would still expect some level of demonstration on how to apply the theories in a problem solving scenario. :: no. :: No. :: No Comments. :: no. :: No additional comments. :: no. :: Why on earth is this course listed for a Mechanical Engineering student?  Last time I checked Hydrogen is Chem. E's department. Come on WSU. :: Great teacher, would definitely take again."
3478,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7730,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- perfect. :: Very effective lecturer, could communicate challenging concepts well and two things that particularly helped in student understanding were 1. usually starting off with a brief review of what was covered before and 2. lots of in-class exercises with discussions, especially with the class-wide discussions that followed. :: good. :: Very effective."

3481,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7730,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- very well. :: Always accepted questions, often asking if there were any before moving on or concluding; encouraging in-class teamwork and discussion; assigning interesting articles for projects that covered material that wasn't covered in lecture, but that was relevant and made connections to what we had learned. :: yes. :: He contributes his time and effort to answer the students' questions and help them with learning.  He is also always available during office hours."

3485,Amir Farajian,2016 Fall,ME 7730,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- he is great. :: I thought the group-focused work often done in class was very helpful; different group members could often contribute different insights to help the others understand/internalize concepts they might not have thought of on their own, and this was particularly valuable mid-lecture (so one wouldn't get ""stuck"" on something and not have a firm understanding of what the rest of the lecture was based on). Group work outside of class was also helpful, although I did have groupmates who would reliably attempt the work on their own before discussing it, so there was no concern about someone not contributing. Not that any changes necessarily need to be made, but if the course changes its form in the future, I think expanding the projects is one direction it could go in. I agree with the decision to cover everything fully rather than rushing to attempt to cover everything that was mentioned in the syllabus. :: No."
3486,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Mrs. Mirmasoudi was very effective in her teaching. She took the time to explain how to fulfill tasks in SOLIDWORKS. Whenever there was a problem, she was very understanding; especially with computer crashes, which happened quite often. :: Somewhat effective. :: The instructor was effective in teaching the material for the class. Prior skills learned in the class were built upon in order to create an understanding of the course material. :: Very understanding of new student's experience, and worked with said students to allow them to better understand the material. Her assigned work tested and pushed our understandings effectively, and allowed us to learn new material at a steady rate. She made the class very interesting and enjoyable . :: She used her past experiences to teach us how to use many different features in Solid Works. The main way she would teach was by demonstrating a certain skill and then telling us to do the same thing for ourselves, which was very effective for learning new things. :: Poor. :: Okay. :: Slightly below average. :: Sara is a very informational teacher and very effective. :: Good. :: Good. :: The only problem I had with the instructor is that she went slightly fast, but she did pause throughout the class period to make sure everyone could catch up. :: Did an okay job. Sometimes a little unclear  and abstract during lessons and course materials. Taught a lot of material myself. :: She knew what she was doing most of the time. she needs to slow down for some students because shell do an on and off thing where she'll slow down so people can catch up then go racing ahead, stop, then repeat. :: She was very good and knowledgeable. :: The instructor was able to teach the skills necessary for a student to learn the basics of Solidworks. :: This instructor taught a lot very efficiently. :: Overall, she was an effective instructor and I enjoyed her class. At the beginning, she went through material too quickly, but throughout the course, she altered that and presented material at a more comfortable speed. :: Has students teach the class. :: She was not that clear in her instruction. :: This instructor is great. :: Very knowledgeable about the content and the program, however, she did not always convey it well enough. She would go too fast at point and not provide supplemental help. But when you would reach out to her, she was always extremely helpful and effective. :: very helpful and involved in the class, taught from personal experience. :: The teacher constructed lectures very quickly and were hard to follow. :: she is a good a instructor but their are issues. One is that she flies through lectures and a lot of people get behind because they have never had experience with 3-D modeling. Another issue is that she expects to do one thing on a task, but when its due she changes her mind right before its due. :: I believe she was a very effective instructor for solidworks. I learned all of the information I needed for the design tasks and projects within the class. :: The teacher was overall very useful. She went over everything without anything being way too difficult. :: She knows what she is talking about, BUT she teachers us like we are interns and we are freshmen in a beginner course. some students have not been exposed to a 3D modeling program. :: She did not always allow time for questions and a lot of the class fell behind during class. :: Not as effective as I would have liked. :: Haphazard instruction consistent with a novice instructor. I have no doubt she knows exactly what she's doing in Solidworks, but communicating it to a group of students isn't her strong suit. :: its very fast so it makes it hard to follow along. also notes aren't posted onto pilot so it makes it very hard to retain information. :: Her teaching helped me establish a better hold on other modeling programs, overall effective!. :: Sometimes it was difficult to keep up and understand what was being taught. :: good. :: She was able to explain topics well and help students with problems. She did not understand some of the struggles faced by many of the students, but overall showed a desire to help them. The only issue came with her organization. Many of the assignments and instructions lacked details, that she could not provide. She utilized the departments assignments, so many times she would not know certain instructions were in the assignment, or were missing from the assignment. :: Much of the instructor's effectiveness was altered by factors she could not control-mainly computer issues in the classroom.  However, she communicated information effectively, and did her best to fix whatever problems came up and answer any questions as quickly as possible. :: Shes very good and she knows what she is doing. :: The effectiveness of the instructor was effective to a certain extent. Not very effective after halfway through the course because she does not explain the directions of the assigned tasks well enough. :: I believe the instructor did a good job in teaching the course information. :: she didn't wait for anybody. :: Very knowledgeable in the subject matter.  Able to explain complex tasks simply. Available to students during class time.  Willing to help.  Could be more clear in instructions, specifically what is due, where, and when."
3487,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, she did. :: yes. :: The instructor was strict on the quality of work expected. While the class was more difficult than I expected, it caused me to work harder to learn the course material. Thus, the expectations of the instructor aided in the understanding of the course material. :: yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was very accurate to what was expected in class. :: No. :: Yes. :: No. :: Yes, she did evaluate my work on weekly design tasks. :: Yes. :: Yes, she followed the syllabus almost verbatim with some slight additions or omissions with multiple weeks notice. :: Yes. :: Yes, work was evaluated as described in the syllabus. :: Yes, the instructor graded the work fairly and based off of the expectations she had given. :: This instructor did grade on a fair scale based on the syllabus. :: Yes. :: The TA's did all the work. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes-more quizzes than initially mentioned before. :: yes. :: My work was evaluated as followed in the syllabus. :: course syllabus was pointless because we got so behind that she didn't teach us what the other classes were taught. :: Yes she did. She followed the syllabus very closely, and even ran the class a little easier than the syllabus described for the semester. :: Yes, the teacher followed the course syllabus very closely. :: I never read the course syllabus. sorry. :: Yea. :: yes. :: Towards the end of the course. Expectations for the early assignments were unorganized and often changed based on her own last-minute verbal revisions. :: yes she did. :: Yes, she did. :: yes. :: of course she did. :: In general she graded based on the instructions of the assignments, but the syllabus was vague at best. No midterm or final dates are located on it. Also the number of assignments and due dates of the assignments had to be given in class because they were not listed in the syllabus. She graded students fairly, and she understood when students had problems. :: Yes. :: Yup. :: Yes she did evaluate my work based on the syllabus. :: Yes, the teacher did a good job on going over the information described in the syllabus. :: she used old slides and didn't read over them. :: Yes"

Class started every day within 5 minutes of the actual start time, with the exception of one day that she was slightly late. The class period was rarely ever completely use, mainly because it was a 2.5 hour class. About 1 or 1.5 hours was devoted to learned then the rest was lab time that we could use to ask questions and work on homework. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Class started on time, but rarely went the full period. :: Routinely started on time, rarely went the full time. :: She assigned the class period as half lab and half class period. there were quite a few times where we ended class and started lab about a half hour early. :: Yes, she used the entire class time for teaching, and class started on time. :: The instructor always started class on time, however the classes vary rarely ran out to its full length, simply because the alotted class time was from 6:30 Pm to 9:00 Pm, two days a week, which makes it a very long class if it always used the entire length of time. :: This professor was always on time, but due to the time scheduled we would often be let out early if we finished early. we were also allowed to work after class with her to get a better understanding. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: we always started on time, occasionally we got out of class early when we finished the lesson. :: Classes started on time. :: She started the class on time but was late a couple times. she kind of used the full class period. :: Class always started on time, and she always let us out early. I do not believe letting us out early was a problem because she taught everything we needed. Every time we were released early, the class became open lab and we were allowed to work on homework and ask questions. If people did not ask questions during this time, it was their own fault. :: We would be let out early sometimes, but this did not happen often. :: class always started on time. the end time varied depending on the information being taught. :: Yes. :: Class started on time.  However, class ended in open lab where we could leave so I don't know about whether the class ended on time or not. :: Yes. Except for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Break. I waited all day for a 20-minute class where we learned about things that were mostly irrelevant to the course requirements. It was more or less a waste of my time and I was less than amused to drive for 3 hours at night when I could've left that morning. :: yes. :: Sometimes class ended early, but lab times for needed help was offered until the class was over. :: yes,. :: Yes. :: Yes, she utilized her time effectively. She also left time for students to ask questions and finish lab work. :: No.  Often the class ended very early.  The lectures were short; however, the instructor always kept the room open for Open Lab for the rest of the class period, and remained until everyone had left to answer any questions the students had. :: She started class on time and used the full period as an open lab. :: She started the class on time and regularly ended class very early. :: The instructor started the class on time everyday and used most of the time. When there was extra class time it turned into open lab for any questions about the class. :: no. :: Yes.  Some classes felt like filler however."
3489,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- She was always very helpful whenever there was trouble with a design task. :: By seeming very interested in the subject. :: The instructor worked hard to ensure that I understood the course material. All of my questions were answered and the instructor ensured that I developed the necessary skills. :: Since my major is engineering, this course included a lot of what I will be doing later on in different classes. She included real world examples and projects that involved much of why I chose my major. :: She had high expectations on everything we did in class. :: Sometimes. :: She really didn't. :: She would stop class to help those who were behind. :: She had interactive lectures. :: Yes. :: For the most part, she just answered questions that were asked, but that's it. :: Class was rather dry and uninteresting. :: She made she we were engaged and tried to challenge us. :: The instructor was willing to wait and repeat processes if needed and willing to be cooperative with the students on some skills and issues. :: This professor showed care, if you showed that you cared about her class. :: During lab section of the class, she would go around and make sure everyone was comfortable with what they were doing. During class, she very frequently asked if everyone was on the same page and if anyone needed help. :: No. :: she didn't. :: She always wanted to help and trouble shoot problems with you. :: She would respond to my emails, ask how I was doing with design tasks, and what parts of the program I was confused on or needed more practice in. :: she would always ask if we had any questions and she would always make sure we had them resolved. :: Followed step by step on board, but ran through the work too quick to follow. :: sometimes, but I think she cared more about herself. :: She actively tried to answer every question that was asked of her. :: She would always ask if any of us had difficulty in completing or understanding one of the problems from design task. :: I was interested in the class, but did not look forward to coming to class because I was unable to follow along the greatest. :: She had lab time at the end of class but would sit and talk with the TAs and it was hard to get help. :: I don't know, I couldn't tell if she did or not. :: She answered questions until the answers hindered the progress of the lecture. She would tell the student to remind her after class and moved on, basically leaving the student behind. :: emailing me back about concerns of grades and problems with homework. :: Yes, she did, she made me want to keep pushing forward in my career in Mechanical Engineering. :: She would constantly try and show us different techniques, that we had not seen before. :: The instructor demonstrated interest in our learning by always being accessible to us all. :: She made sure we were constantly challenged. :: She did demonstrate an interest in learning by showing us videos and explaining how things are done in the workplace. :: By always asking if anyone had questions and making sure every one knew what they was doing before she moved on. :: she didnt. :: Yes"
3490,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- She communicated very well and was very helpful. Both her TAs were very helpful also, Vasuman Kota and Molly Donovan. :: somewhat effective. :: The instructor communicated effectively in and out of class through the sue of campus email. :: She responded quickly to emails, and made time before or after class to answer any questions myself or my peers had. If time was not available during class, and the question could not be answered over email, she made time outside of class. :: Very well in the classroom, she always told us everything we needed to now during class. Not much communication out of class was necessary, but when it was, she was very responsive to emails. :: Not effective at all, did not get back to my emails for days. :: Not very well. :: The in class instructions were poor and to clarify them an email was almost neccecary. :: Very effectively. :: Well. :: When questions were asked in mass, she would send an email to everyone to clear the confusion. :: Somewhat. :: Communication could have been better. :: She communicated very effectively outside the classroom by constantly emailing us and in class she made sure that we were caught up. :: The instructor always made her point clearly in class and if need be, she would email the class with additional or supplemental information. :: She communicated fairly well outside of class, and if you wanted her attention in class you'd have to wait till the very end. :: Very well, everything was always posted on pilot (which I really appreciated) and she made things clear in class. :: Poorly but did respond o n her own time when she could. Which was completely okay. :: not very well. :: Very well. Always answered emails. :: Well, she would respond to emails within at least 48 hours. :: many emails helping us out if we had any questions. :: Some things were clear but also had quite a bit of confusion throughout the course. :: Very good. :: She communicated very well. She always emailed updates to the class. :: Very well, she let us email her if we had any problems outside of class. :: she did communicate very well. frequent reminders and emails were sent out. :: She communicated but it was hard to get answers for questions. :: First half of the semester, it was hard to hear her in the large computer lab ( then she got a mic).  Emails kept everyone up to date. :: She communicated verbally in class. Not a bad thing, it's what you should expect from an employer. :: great. :: Sometimes good, however sometimes not super communicative. :: prompt. :: I always got a respond quickly. :: She was vague with her explanations at first, but towards the end of the semester she emailed and announced anything that came up. :: She communicated with help from TAs by going around and helping when needed; outside of class she responded to questions sent via email. :: She was pretty good. :: Not very effectively. :: The instructor always informed the students of any upcoming due dates and emailed if anything changed. :: eh. :: Moderately.  Instructor was not always clear a to intent and what was expected in overall task dues.  More organization would help, specifically for design tasks.  Recommend that instructor utilize the white boards more for overall goals and expectations."
3491,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes, the course content and lectures were very well organized and the class was able to progress throughout the course very well. :: sort of. :: Each lecture was well organized with a defined lesson and skill. The lectures were engaging and easy to follow. :: Yes. :: Could have been more organized in the beginning, but as time went on it got better. :: Not really at all.  Really confusing. :: it was somewhat organized there was issue with the computers which wasn't the instructor fault which made class topics challenging and take more time that planned. :: Not particularly. :: No. :: Yes, absolutely. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Sometimes seemed thrown together. :: Sort of. Some nights it felt like we had already achieved what we needed to do and was trying to come up with stuff for us to do. :: Yes, they were well organized and in an order that made sense. :: The course content was always organized neatly and explained thoroughly. :: The classes were usually well organized. :: Yes. Sometimes we would start designing things without knowing what they were. I think it would be a good idea to have more of an explanation of the part we would be making. :: No. :: not really. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: very well. :: Most days were organized but some were not. :: some were well organized, but most were not organized at all. :: The class was organized according to the syllabus, and was followed well. :: Yes, I was able to understand everything. :: no. :: Yes. :: Organized chronologically with respect to the book. :: The lectures were usually pertinent to the weekly assignment. :: sometimes. :: Yes, they were very informative and useful. :: sometimes. :: not really. :: Sometimes the lectures would be well structured, but some of them were not at the correct times. That means some of them were after we needed to learn the technique. :: Yes. :: Yes the skills gradually built on each other as the difficulty increased. :: Yes they were well organized. :: Yes. :: I guess. :: Moderately"
3492,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes she was. She even set up ""tutoring"" hours outside of class with the TAs. :: yes. :: The instructor was available to all of my needs. While I had class during the usual lab hours for this class, the instructor offered lab hours directly following each lecture. The instructor was also responsive via campus email. :: Yes. :: I never scheduled any thing like that so I can not say. :: No not at all. :: No. :: Yes. :: Yes, she was. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, TAs especially. :: What emails I did send, I did not receive answers to. :: Yes. :: Yes, the instructor was easily reached through email, and it was easy to set aside time to speak with her. :: office hours were at a weird time but i never needed them because you could stay after and get help. :: Yes, very. :: No. :: some times. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes she would always respond very fast to emails if we had any questions. :: Yes. :: nope, she didn't have office hours. :: Yes, she was always available. :: Yes. :: there were no office hours for the teacher, only ta's.   *online*. :: Not all the time, it took time to get answers. :: Had office hours. :: Yes. The TA's were usually available. I didn't use these resources often, though. :: yes. :: I never required to see her during office hours. :: yes. :: She always responded to emails promptly. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: She was reasonably available, although was unresponsive to email most of the time. :: I personally do not know about the office hours since I didn't attend any, or make any appointments. :: ya. :: Yes"
3493,Sara Mirmasoudi,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I was very happy with the way things progressed throughout this course. :: none. :: The instructor was very effective in building my knowledge of the course material. The high expectations of the instructor caused me to invest more effort in the class and the course material. :: TA's were very helpful as well. During class, they would help catch up anyone who fell behind on the computer program. They also helped answer questions both in class and over email. :: No. :: I didn't enjoy her class. :: No. :: no. :: No. :: She was a good teacher. :: The biggest issue with this class was all the software issues with the different yearly versions of the required Solidworks CAD programs provided to the students. :: In lecture she could be a little intimidating (what professor isn't?), but if you stayed after lecture for help she became a pretty cool person. :: She made Solidworks fun to work with and showed us how she actually used it at work, and really illustrated ""how are we ever going to use this in the real world?!"". I enjoyed her class a lot. :: I had taken a class last year and knew what to do in the class now. I'm using past skills to advance in the class. :: This instructor is great and is very helpful. She has high expectations that are all reasonable for engineering students. One of my favorites. :: very fun and enjoyable teacher, would highly suggest to another student, and would take again. :: In the end the class was very hard to follow, she wasn't the best teacher. But the TA's were very good and useful during class, they could teach the class better than she could. She would never help students during class and would always make the TA's do the work for her. She wasn't the best but she wasn't the worst. :: No. :: easy to fall behind during class.  the TA's did a fantastic job helping out. :: Most stressful class.  I felt it didn't have to be as stressful as it was, but miscommunication and unclear instructions made each project a roulette of what needed to be turned in or not.  Mistakes and miscommunication were resolved though. :: Before this course, I only had an idea of how to use Solidworks. And I certainly wouldn't have been effective without taking this course. I think my previous knowledge of CAD helped me the most in succeeding in this course. It could've been taught more clearly and less painfully. I think the credit value should be raised. I spent an average of eight hours per week on this course and did a lot of running around. I've noticed, however, that the credit value has actually been reduced for future semesters. A filthy decision that doesn't give students enough credit for the work they perform. :: no. :: Overall great class and instructor, enjoyed my stay!. :: More organization, More dates and info, and better structured design tasks. Many of them were vague or referenced items that were not available. :: No. :: I feel that she should go slower during the class. Starting out in the class with no background in solidworks was a bare. It was hard to know what she was talking about when I had never used any applications such as this before. Also needs to allow students to use newer versions of Solidworks on home computers because the versions of solidworks conflict with each other. Otherwise very nice to work with. :: No. :: she was very mean and scary >:D. :: Overall course was enjoyable and educational.  The design tasks could serve to be reorganized to provide clearer instructions specifically on what is due.  The instructor although helpful and available can occasionally appear to be speaking down to students and can be a bit condescending, this was not excessive however it did happen on multiple occasions and was a barrier to learning."
3494,Vikas Sinha,2016 Fall,ME 7760,Question 1,Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good. :: Good. :: Effective.  He discussed theories in detail and did his best to make sure everyone was following what he was describing.

Goes the extra length to get his point across. :: Superb. :: This instructor was very helpful and knowledgeable in his subject, and got the information across in a way that was understandable. Professor Thomas always made sure to ask questions in case someone needed help. :: o. :: Incredibly effective.  He was hands-on, vibrant, and incredibly willing to help.  I learned a lot in this class, and I feel like I can use what I've learned in the real-world.  Awesome job. :: Very Good. :: Scott is extremely animated during his lectures, which helps engage students. I felt as though his teaching style is effective. :: Scott Thomas, the instructor, is very good at teaching Matlab and very passionate about teaching and his class and students. :: He was extremely effective as an instructor.

He let us know what kind of problems would be on the exams. :: Good. :: Very effective. :: Excellent teacher. :: Very effective. :: The instructor was very effective throughout the entire semester. :: gave his 100% and was very efficient in his ways. :: Scott Thomas was such a great instructor. He provided all materials on Pilot that I found very helpful. :: This instructor was very effective.  He was precise and worked with the students to get the desired results. :: Extremely effective, especially through his in class examples. :: In-class explanations and humor were very helpful for understanding and motivation."
3503,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 1020,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, homework included problems that were based on the topic related to it. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he followed the syllabus to the dot. :: Yes, exactly.  This is how I feel classes should be taught. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yeah, very well. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the instructor did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: yes, he did. :: The instructor did evaluate according to the syllabus. :: The course content lined up precisely with the syllabus, without ever having to be modified. :: yes"
3504,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 1020,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes, he would start class at exactly the right time and would use almost the entire class period. :: Yes. I like knowing that I will not miss any material unless I show up after exactly 11:00. :: Yes. :: Yes, he always started at 11 and used all of, if not most of the class time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes exactly on time. :: Yes, he starts exactly on time every time. :: Yes.

3505,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 1020,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Whenever we were doing in class example problems, he would walk around to see if we needed help with the problem or not. :: He definitely took the time to make sure every student was on the same track. :: An incredible amount. :: He always wanted to know if we understood the material and were caught up in the class. :: He would walk around and ask you individually if you understand it.  That definitely helps with people that are more shy, and afraid to speak in front of everyone.  He would work with you one-on-one briefly to try and get you to understand material.  He's been effective with that strategy every single time. :: Very  Demonstration. :: He was very active and gave use lots of materials. :: He goes out of his way to comment and assist every student on every homework and test so they learn from their mistakes and understand how to do the problems even if you have moved on to a new subject. :: He personally made sure every student was caught up during lectures before moving on. :: He always took the time to answers questions.

I would recommend him to any student, and I will try my best to take him again if possible. Great job!. :: Excellent Professor. :: By FAR one of the best professors I have had at Wright State and I look forward to taking his other classes in near future!. :: No, I do not have any additional comments. :: Nope, except that he is the best teacher I have had in the past few years at Wright State. He should get a raise and be invited to share his teaching methods with all the other teachers:  for example, I like how he anticipates our learning curve and most efficiently directs it higher by absolutely refraining from burdening his students with time-costly micromanagement."
3510,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 2120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Very effective. :: The professor provided adequate data for a student to learn, but he did not teach the materials of the class very well. :: Instructor was at time unclear about explanations but was overall effective. :: Very effective instructor. Willing to answer any questions and uses class time very well. :: Dr. Thomas clearly and effectively taught this course. :: Good. :: Very Effective. :: very good. :: Was very effective. :: The teaching style did not match my learning style, so I haven't learned as much as I would like from this class. However, the instructor was very informative and the information learned in class was relevant to the homework assigned. :: Absolutely amazing professor that really knows how to explain hard subjects. Very fair and makes everyone feel like it's okay to ask questions. :: Extremely effective. He knows exactly what students will struggle with and knows exactly how to help them. :: Dr. Thomas is incredibly effective in the way he instructs the course. 10 out of 10. :: Professor Thomas is a good teacher. :: Used all of class time for examples, helped if someone didn't understand how to do anything. :: Excellent professor, perhaps my favorite thus far at the university. Very motivated to teach, engaging, and thorough in explanations. :: He was very effective I think. The material was hard but he was able to describe it in a way that was a little easier to understand. :: I really liked scott as a professor he was very knowledgeable and for the most part i understood what he was trying to explain to us. Loved the way the class was set up, would always remind us when homework was due and when tests were coming up. Also loved how he made everything available to use such as previous homework or exams so we could study. Exams were pretty tough but that is expected when learning a hard subject. :: He would go through several examples in class, but I wish he would go through how to better look at statics problems and how to effectively draw free body diagrams. :: Very Good. :: Very effective! Scott Thomas is easily the best professor I have had so far at Wright State.  It is obvious that he knows his stuff, and he keeps the class entertaining.  I hope to take more courses with Professor Thomas in the future. :: Dr. Thomas is very efficient with his teaching. He gets straight to the point while still keeping the class fun and interesting. :: Lectures were very effective. Scott made the class interesting and tied the lectures to real world situations. Compared to other classes, students respect Scott and are always coming to class prepared to learn the material and are never disappointed in the material that is taught. :: Very excited, interesting professor. I think his only issues are: - Too much homework - never goes over Working Model 2D in class - Suffers from an issue I think a lot of professors have, which is not being able to put himself in the position of a student who is brand new to the material. It seems a lot of the important details get skipped over in class.  Overall, though, he is very hard working and does a good job. He is very fair to the students and is always available for help. :: Scott is pretty effective however he could do a better job by going through the steps of each problem.  However the lectures didn't really prepare for the exams and a review would be greatly appreciated. :: The instructor, Scott Thomas, is very good at teaching statics, and has an obvious and infectious love for the subject that translates well into learning. :: Very efffective. :: very effective. :: Very effective. Went through multiple example problems in class that helped greatly with my understanding. :: I have had Dr. Thomas before, and I always feel like I learn a lot from his classroom. He is very effective. :: Very effective, was clearly excited about the class, making it very enjoyable. :: He's a fantastic teacher. His lectures or notes are very well organized and easy to follow. You can tell he tries to make the material as interesting as it gets. He likes to relate the topics we cover in class to real life situations or applications. This is extremely helpful. Most teachers don't give their students the time of day but the opposite can be said of Scott Thomas. He is 100% willing to help his students understand in class and outside of the classroom. :: Excellent Professor. :: He was a very good instructor. Lessons were taught step by step, and his teaching was very efficient. :: I don't think I've ever had a better instructor. This is my second time taking the class and I actually enjoyed coming to class even though it was very hard. He explained things really well and was always available. :: He explains topics well in a generally interesting manner. When many people did poorly on a test, he made sure to address the problem. :: The teacher is a very great teacher . Class time is well spent and teaches you exactly what he tests you on. :: Amazing instructor. One of the best instructors I've had so far hands down. I will definitely keep my eye out for more classes with Dr. Thomas. :: The instructor was great at explaining very difficult material and was very responsible with class time usage. :: He is very effective in his teaching. He know what he is talking about and he explains everything very well. :: Thomas was very effective in teaching. I feel as if I have learned all of the material very, very well because of him. :: Overall a very effective professor. Started class on time, went at a steady pace and made sure students understood what was going on. :: Very effective. :: Dr. Thomas is a great professor and is one of the few to take the time and explain the course material well. He is passionate about the field of engineering and he wants his students to succeed. :: Instructor was decently effective. He is very passionate about his job and loves what he does. He was fair in all assessments and was always there to help. Although he was very passionate and helpful I don't think he did a good job of explaining the topics. For each topic he would explain a little and then spend the rest of the time doing examples. When doing examples, he didn't explain his steps very well and I was often left feeling confused. I think it would be more helpful to do a little less example problems and a little more explaining the approach and the thought process behind it. :: He was pretty effective. :: Very enthusiastic and interested in what he was teaching, therefore making the learning environment better. :: Excellent. :: Very effective, passionate about his field and very well versed in the material. Very interested in setting a strong foundation for engineers getting into major-specific coursework. :: Good instructor, very enthusiastic about the course , showed a genuine interest in the success of every student."
3511,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 2120,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: The professor evaluated work based exactly on how they were listed within the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the expectations and goals were very clearly described and followed. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, however I feel like the homework did not match the exams well. The exams tended to be much harder than the content learned in class and the homework. I understand that the exams are meant to be challenging, but even after attending lecture, doing the homework, asking questions in class or during office hours, and studying for the exams, I felt unprepared. Also, only having three problems on the exam left no room for mistakes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: To the letter, no unfairness. :: He was very clear on expectations. :: Yes. :: Yes down to the letter. The course syllabus was perfect in every way!. :: Yes. :: Yes followed the syllabus right to a T. Showed it everyday to the class and said what we were doing that day that was listed. Kept to the schedule. :: yes, but he did expect us to have pretty elaborate knowledge of how to use working model, which I had never used before. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was exact. :: Yes, he is beyond fair. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he strives to be a very fair grader. Everything is exactly as it is laid out in the syllabus. :: Yes everything was graded very fairly, and according to the syllabus. :: Yes. His expectations were very clear from the beginning.

Provided real world applications of problems/topics so that students would have a practical understanding for future employment and engineering pursuits.  Truly cared about how well the subject was understood by all, I cannot express that enough. '. :: He would show videos about senior competitions and then would talk about how statics related to that and shown that the material was important. :: He made sure that we weren't afraid to ask questions to him would always say that there were no dumb questions and would even thank the person for bringing the question up to the class. Would always answer the question to the best of his ability till you fully understood what you didn't previously know. :: He would run through problems during all of class time and then at the end he would have us do a problem for extra credit which I really appreciated. :: Made sure everyone knew the subjects and how to do them. Also Making it a point to know the majority of the students names. Made connections to the work we were doing and the work we would have to do in real life. :: If one topic of the lecture was giving a majority of the class problems, he had no problems with going back over the topic and giving more examples of the situation.

3514,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 2120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very well. :: The instructor did a great job of communicating with me inside and outside of class. He responded to my emails within a day. :: Was very clear and very communicative. :: Communication was good. :: Dr. Thomas was always available in and out of class for question whether it was in person or via email. :: Great. :: Pretty effective, working through problems together works well. :: very well. :: The instructor communicated both in and out of the classroom. :: Well.

Also wrote things down neatly and always asked the class if he was doing anything wrong and if everyone could see and understand what was going on. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Very well. :: yes. :: Very organized. :: Yes. His classes were very organized, but he did a little too many examples and that's sort of how some of the details get glazed over. :: Yes the content and lectures was organized well. :: The content and lectures were very well organized. :: Yes and examples upon examples made the material more clear than any plain lecture ever would. :: very organized. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was always good about knowing exactly what we needed to cover for a particular class period. :: Yes all lectures followed an exact plan. :: Yes. His lectures and class overall was very well organized. :: Yes. :: All lectures were very well organized and effectively/efficiently used. :: Yes.

Nothing was ever changed or rescheduled. :: Yes, it was incredibly well organized. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Very well organized, all material available on instructor's site. :: yes followed syllabus to a tee"
3516,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 2120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: The professor was great at being available to meet with me whenever. He did a great job with communicating with his students. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas was always available for questions. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. Very helpful. :: Yes, any time you had a question. :: Yes. Great in office hours. :: Consistently available, always found time to be available. :: I never went to office hours. :: Yes. :: Yes. Above and beyond! Even offered to come in on days where he would not typically be on campus to aid any struggling students. :: Yes. He was always willing to help. :: Over email he was wonderful responded within a reasonable amount of time and was very helpful. Never visited him in office hours though. :: I never needed to contact him outside of class. :: Yes. :: Always very responsive. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: He always told the class to go to him during his office hours at the end of each class and was happy to do so. :: Yes, he was always available. :: Yes. :: very reliable. :: He always made himself available for students that needed help with the material. :: Yes, he has always been there when I needed his office hours. :: Yes, he was available through both office hours and email. :: I never tried to contact him outside of class, but, when i had him last semester for a different class, he was to get in touch with outside of the class.

I went to his office hours a couple of times and he was always interested to help me. :: Yes he was. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I never needed to talk to him outside of class, but if I would have, I have no doubt that he would've done anything he could to help me. :: Yes, he was always open to meeting whenever necessary. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, always answered emails very quickly. :: Always. :: Yes. :: always"
3517,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 2120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: I have no additional comments. :: Nope. :: Makes class enjoyable and gives very interesting demonstrations. Very fair class and well balanced. :: Great Professor, cares and gives students resources. :: no. :: I appreciate the small amount of bonus given for attending class. It is a helpful reward to those who want to come to class and learn, without being detrimental to the students' grades for necessary absences. For the amount of time it takes to complete the homework and amount of effort it requires, the homework should be a larger part of the overall grade. Although the exams are important to test our knowledge, the homework is a good way to determine if we understand the content before taking the exams and only ended up being a small portion of our grade. Also, it was very inconvenient to scan the homework and submit it electronically. It would have been much more beneficial to turn in a paper copy, which could be marked up to show students' mistakes and returned, as opposed to reading the less informative comments available to see in the drop box. Especially since we had to work it all out on paper anyway. Also, a big emphasis on fairness is placed on the grading in this class, however the second exam was much harder than intended and curved for the students who turned it in (I was unaware that there was a possibility that the exams could be curved). Students who decided to not turn it now have a final that is the majority of their grade and received no compensation for the exam that the class as a whole was not adequately prepared for. This set up benefits the students already doing well in the class, and further hurts the students who are struggling. :: Hope to have him again because I really learn a lot more with him than any other professor. :: Scott is an excellent professor. He is very helpful in class with questions and during office hours. He is great at explaining the material and providing all of the material needed to do well in the class. He gave me tips when I visited a company about an internship and has pushed me to become a better student. I will take as many classes with Scott in the future as possible. :: Dr. Thomas did an incredible job teaching this course. 10 out of 10. :: Maybe make the exams a bit easier. :: No. :: Awesome guy. Awesome professor. I hope I have the opportunity to take more courses with him!. :: o. :: I really enjoyed his enthusiasm that he had when conducting the class. It could have been a really dry and boring class but he made it interesting. The material itself was hard not him. He did have hard tests but it was to make sure you really knew the material in order to show that this material may have lives at stake when know the structures of towers, beams, and etc. :: Loved the class and loved the way he teaches. Only complaint would be I wish he would explain more on what he did to get certain steps instead of writing straight from the notes, but overall was a wonderful professor and would gladly take again. :: Prof Thomas seems to really want everyone to succeed and you can definitely tell that he cares about our learning but I kind of wish we could've walked through certain things a little slower since it takes me a little while to completely grasp this kind of stuff. He also frequently missed when hands were raised in class. However, I do think he is a good professor. :: I sincerely hope to take more courses with Professor Thomas in the future.  Honestly one of the best professors/teachers I have had in my life. :: Scott is a great professor. He respects students and the students respect him. Makes class interesting and teaches the material thoroughly. Is very fair to all students with grading. Would love to take another class with this professor. :: Overall a very good professor. I would recommend others to take him if possible. :: Very nice and fair teacher, tries to make the class as fun as possible however could do a better job with clarifying the important steps of each problem and too review for his difficult exams or at least let the students use a crib sheet. :: Scott Thomas is a very fair, strong teacher, and hopefully he continues teaching at wright state university, as he makes it a better place. :: I missed a few days for being sick and he emailed me to make sure I was ok. This man genuinely cares about his students' well being and learning. :: very good class. he enjoys teaching it which makes it better. :: No. :: Dr. Thomas is a good professor who genuinely cares about your success. :: GREAT INSTRUCTOR. I will definitely advise others to take his classes whenever possible. :: He was very good professor.  He made statics class fun.  He also care about his students. Would take him again for another class. :: If I don't pass this class, I would happily retake it if he was teaching it. :: No. :: Scott Thomas came off as a professor that really does care for his students and I can't say that for many of my professors so far. :: Scott is a very funny and entertaining guy, but at the same time, he is very effective in his teaching. I'd take another one of his classes in a heartbeat. :: Thanks professor Thomas, you rock!. :: No. :: Excellent work Dr. Thomas! Keep it up!. :: No. :: No. :: No. :: There is no spoon. :: excellent instructor wouldn't hesitate to take another one of his classes"

I always learn loads of information, and have a good time while in class. :: Extremely effective professor, always making the most of class time and homework. :: Very effective. :: Scott did a great job teaching. :: Dr. Thomas is probably the best professor in the engineering department. His notes, lectures, and examples are extremely clear. He can clearly communicate theories and complicated concepts, as well as answer questions well, even when they are poorly asked. :: Very Effective"

He always said ""and it is five-o-clock exactly"" and would begin class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: We always started class on time and would use the entire period. :: Always on time. :: Always! ""5 O'clock Exactly"". :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes"
3521,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 3320,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Used real world examples and took the time to answer all questions. :: Yes, Dr. Thomas is one of the best instructors I've had in this regard. :: He genuinely cares if we understand the content. :: showed up to class, had worked out examples, seemed enthusiastic about our learning, changed schedule to give us more valuable content to learn. :: By answering all questions. :: Scott is very enthusiastic when he teaches, which helps keep students engaged in the lecture. He also routinely brings relevant examples of real world applications of the content we are learning. :: He was always very open to answering questions in class, and will not stop explaining something until the student tell him that they understand now. :: He made it clear that questions were encouraged and always willing to help at office hours. :: He was willing to help. :: He truly cares for the students and makes himself open and available for questions. :: By how spoke in lecture. :: Posed questions that were related to real world applications of the content."
3522,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 3320,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Very effectively. :: He was very effective in class, I did not speak to him outside of class about any course material so I can't judge him there. :: Very effectively. :: very effectively. :: average. :: Very well. :: Awesome. :: There was no problems with communication. :: Very effective. :: He always responds to emails promptly and is always in his office during his office hours. :: well. :: Very well"

3525,Scott Thomas,2016 Fall,ME 3320,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- No. :: Would take more of Dr. Thomas's classes given the opportunity. :: By far the best professor I've ever had. :: no. :: Wish he would teach compressible flow!. :: I have always loved and still love the way he uses his webpage. Having all of the solutions to the homeworks is SO valuable. Not for copying either, but to help you along when you get stuck. I always read through the book chapter to understand why he solved a problem the way he did and I would much better understand the subject as opposed to if I had no way to check my answer. He's awesome! I love your positivity in class, keep it up. :: Great professor."
3526,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Great examples of real life situations. :: Seemed to lack familiarity with the experimental procedure and often led students in the wrong direction, however his theory and background lectures were more helpful to understanding than the they were in the courses where these subjects were covered. :: good. :: Excellent. :: The instructor is not a right person for this lab and I can say he has given students zero inputs."
3527,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Expectations for the reports were clear. However, more information about what the oral exams entailed could have been helpful. :: Yes. :: Absolutely no. In oral exams he asks students in a way to trick them. He doesn't ask about the procedures and stuff students did in the lab. He asks questions whatever in his mind and something for higher level class. Oral exams are not fair to evaluate someone's work. I can tell he is a lazy instructor . I do not recommend him anymore."

3529,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 4,How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Very well. :: He is not clear when he demonstrates any lab. In the lab manual says someting and he says something else without clerfying the mistakes. He is not prepared for this class. Even the TA is hard to understand him.

3532,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Reasonably. :: Yes"
3533,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4620,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Great class but should be offered sooner in course schedule, for example sophomore or junior years of study. This class should taken along with Mechanics of Materials, where a lot of the lab material is learned. Once learned in class, the lab would emphasize and explain the theory in more detail, plus give a real world example. :: No. :: This class should not have oral exams and I think it is really unfair for any students. Since, he doesn't clarify things up on the lab manual and even the TA is confusied sometimes with students."
3534,Maher Amer,2016 Fall,ME 4720,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- good but needs improvement. :: He is a good instructor and very effective. :: Dr. Amer knows exactly what he is talking about and knows how to link it to real world situations. He has taught me not to just memorize the material, but to actually understand what I am being taught. :: Effective. :: Tough, but somehow the teaching style is more effective than almost everyone I've ever taken. :: he is a very good teacher that he know what he is doing in his class his lectures were well organized. there were not any complication that face me about the subject with him. :: Dr. Amer is a great communicator, but he tends to be vague with his expectations with the specific material. His overall expectations where that we had to know the material forwards and backwards without having any imperfections. His final exam tested us over information that was outside the scope of what he told us he would test us over. :: Effective teacher. Very informative. :: good. :: good. :: Professor knew his topics but sometimes talked above our heads. :: ok he moved very fast and taught the class too much like a graduate level course. :: he is one of the best instructors that i had in WSU. he explains his materials with a real life application which makes me able to visualize what he is explaining. he through a small joke from time to time to break the seriousness of the lecture which will bring back your attention even if you were lost at some point. :: he is a good professor . always give examples for every thing he explain which makes the material easy to understand. :: Dr. Amer is very well versed in the topics he teaches, and seems to have an interest in the student's learning.  He explains everything as well as he can if you ask questions, but he doesn't hold your hand throughout the class and you are responsible for your own success. :: His class was extremely interesting and he presented it in a way that made it fun. :: Taught well and motivated the class. Funny professor. :: Good. :: Great instructor and the class time spent well on the teaching. :: no. :: yes. :: good. :: a. :: 5. :: He was a very effective instructor. He made sure everyone was on the same page at the beginning of each lecture and made the material very relatable. :: Dr. Amer was very effective in present his lecture and was very welcome to answer the questions. :: All the lecture notes are messy when he writes on the board  and doesn't upload the notes on Pilot either, which is very hard to follow. I feel his classes are in 80s he doesn't use technology to enhance the lecture. :: GOOD. :: Dr. Amer was reasonably effective as an instructor for this course. He presented the material in a concise and logical manner, and provided numerous examples that helped me understand the concepts. however the assignments, quizzes, and exams appeared to approach the material from different perspectives, and seemed focused on drawing the same conclusions discussed in class. I Learned a lot from Dr. Amer, but feel I would have benefited from more exposure to and practice with the causality relationships between the concepts and their results. :: An  excellent professor. :: he was a very effective instructor. his friendly manner made it much easier to focus and learn."

He stated in class that his grading was our ""professional evaluation"", but there was no information in this evaluation on how we could improve. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes, however he taught it to much like a graduate level course. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: no. :: yes. :: yes. :: 5. :: Yes, expectations were clearly laid out, but I feel as though the work was not evaluated as well as it could. (Missing points on homework with no explanations, but this is more a criticism of the grader). :: yes. :: The grading scale is unfair. When you see final exam worth 35% and students find only half of T and F it seems this class is not a good one. Also, in syllabus assigns online quizzes, but all of the sudden he assigns HMs too and no idea how will calcalaute them. :: Yes. :: GOOD. :: The provided expectations regarding the scope and guidelines for the assignments were somewhat vague. :: Yes, he did. :: the instructor was straightforward and fair with his evaluation"

He takes his time to explain things and always there to help his students. :: Very effective. Very helpful when needed. :: Very effective. He did a great job with the material. :: I learned a lot in this course about the workings of SolidWorks as well as engineering drawings and reports, which will be beneficial in the future when securing a job. :: Very effective!. :: Phenomenal Instructor, provided in-class step-by-step instructions on how to model just about anything. Always loud and clear when speaking. Always open to questions and would stop helping you until you got the answer. :: The instructor's effectiveness was above the expectation I had. The information taught was provided well and thorough. :: Gr8. :: Dr. B was a pretty good instructor, although he often went too fast when showing examples in class.  He was able to help people who were stuck, though, and I was able to learn a lot in his class. :: Dr. B was a super effective instructor. I came into this class with absolutely no experience with this software or any software at all and am now fairly decent at using it, and designing in general. This is all thanks to Dr. B's fantastic teaching abilities!. :: His explanations were very helpful. We had in-class instruction and open lab time to ask questions. Some of the design tasks were difficult, but for the most part they were doable. :: He was an amazing professor!!!. :: Really good great teacher. :: He did very well in my opinion. He kept it straight forward and to the point, he explained with lectures thoroughly with detail. :: This class was a very good introduction to Solidworks and Engineering Design, and Dr. Baudendistal was the ideal instructor for this course. He did a phenomenal job of showing us everyday how to make different parts, along with understanding our work load. He made sure class time was dedicated to him and what he wanted to show us for around the first half of class, and then he and the TA's would go around the rest of the class time helping us with Design Tasks and what questions we had. Overall he was a very effective instructor. :: Dr. B. was a very effective instructor.

He makes sure everyone is on the correct path and caught up and if not he will patiently wait to make sure everyone is at the same place. :: Dr. Baudendistel did a great job teaching and showing how to accomplish task on solidworks. He was able to go around along with the T.A's and help students wen they needed which was helpful at some points. :: The Professor was a great teacher throughout the course. He explained everything in great detail and was always open to questions. :: I think you did very well Craig. I really liked going over parts of Design Tasks in class. I think my experience in SolidWorks would have been a lot harder if you didn't explain how to do certain parts. I think the class was ran very well, but did get a little fast paced on some explanations. All-in-all, very good job!. :: Very effective. He does really well giving individual attention even though he has 70 students to teach. It is really amazing. He makes sure no one gets left behind and he is always willing to help. :: I thought that Dr. Baudendistel was a great teacher and he helped me learn a lot. :: He was a very good teacher, I have had a lot of CAD classes throughout high school and some of the teacher didn't show you how to use the program very well. but he showed us through making a part how to use certain tools and it helped a lot. :: Most excellent. :: This instructor I thought did a good job.  He helped us work through all new tools in class and then had to apply them to the design tasks. :: He did a great job and I learned a lot about Solidworks. :: Dr. B was excellent at assisting students in the learning of the various programs. :: Very effective. :: Dandy. :: I feel like Dr. B was very effective. I really enjoyed this class and I feel he was very  well versed in the program. :: The instructor was very effective and I was able to learn a lot from this class. :: amazing, he goes above and beyond to make sure each student understands. :: Good, spent time to work with students to make sure they understood, very available during class. :: Did a fantastic job teaching the different tools needed to be successful in the program. :: Instructor was very effective, good at explaining and demonstrating programs, and helpful with questions. :: I thought Dr. Baudendistel was a very effective teacher.

Grades were exactly what was listed on the syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was the same as on the syllabus. :: Yes!. :: Yes, the design task had to be formatted properly or points were deducted. :: The instructor's evaluation of my work was exactly as it was expected according to the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes, the grading policies were pretty straightforward. :: I'm going to be honest, I have no idea what the syllabus says. I only looked at it the first day, but I assume yes. :: Yes. Sometimes he gave us more time to complete assignments if we needed it. :: Yes, he was very reasonable and never made anything beyond our capability. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he did, he made sure that the design tasks were completed and enjoyed our feedback so he could see what he would need to improve on. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yep!. :: For the most part, yes. It was slightly unclear as to what was expected with each assignment since it would always change. We also had a midterm exam that wasn't in the syllabus. He sort of adapted the work we were doing in class to fit where we were at and to cover new information he felt necessary. :: Yes. Additionally, the course schedule given to me at the beginning of the course was a very accurate representation of the speed of the course as well as the topics that were covered in the course. :: Yes, the course was the exact same as described on the syllabus. :: Yes. :: yes. :: He followed the syllabus to a metaphorical 'T'. All projects outlined in the syllabus were graded according to the guidelines outlined in the syllabus. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he graded based directly off the course syllabus and had very fair grading. :: Yes. :: Yes, 100%!. :: We covered all the things he needed and wanted us to do at the beginning of the semester.

3552,Craig Baudendistel,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: Yes, class time was well spent. :: Yes. :: All classes were on time and ran the full length. Students could stay after and work (with help) if needed. :: Yes. :: Yes, the class was always started on time, but it didn't always go to the full length since the last half an hour or so was an 'open lab time'. This was helpful because the students who needed more assistance while building parts could stay and receive help while the ones who had worked on the projects outside of class could leave and get started on other homework. :: Yes!. :: Yes, there was quite a bit of open lab time, but 99% of the time students used the full period and he was always moving around the room and teaching. :: The instructor began class and ended class on time and the full class period was used to gain knowledge on the subject taught. :: Yes. :: Class usually started on time, but people would start leaving about 15 or 20 minutes before class was scheduled to end.  For me, that was actually helpful, since I have a lot of back-to-back classes. :: Yes, the class started on time and the whole class was used. Although, some of the time was spent as open lab time and if you were ahead enough, you could leave. This was great because it allowed for extra help after a demonstration was done if it was needed. :: Yes. :: Class was always started on time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Class usually started a few minutes late, and students were expected to stay the full length and work unless they had already completed the work assigned. :: yes class started on time and used all class period unless the student had completed the assignment. :: As close as was reasonable for a class that required computers to get warmed up and applications open. :: Yep! Having like, open lab time when we weren't learning new stuff in class was cool. :: This class usually included him teaching a new skill at the beginning and then open lab time for the rest of the class where he would come around and help us. Class usually would start on time unless he was trying to pull something up on the computer. :: Yes. :: yes, he was always here and ready to start and would stay till the end of class, often after the class ended to help students if they needed it. :: Class started on time and class period was used effectively.  Time at the end of class was given to work on projects which was very helpful. :: yes. :: Dr. B used the time efficiently. Excellent professor. :: yes. :: Yes, every time. :: Yes. :: Yes we always started on the class start time and always used the whole class for learning. :: Yes unless you were already finished with the work we were about to discuss. :: Yes he did. From what I can remember he was always on time and would always give a heads up when he wont be in class so people with questions know to ask earlier then later. :: We regularly started class on time and used our time wisely and efficiently. :: Yes. :: Yes the class did start on time and sometimes we got out early, which I liked. Sometimes we would stay the whole class as needed. :: Yes. This was a long class and he would often give us time to work on assignments which was great because there were so many questions that you would come across as you were working and it was so nice to learn a new skill and then be able to put it to work in our assignment and have him there to help us whenever we needed it. :: yes. we worked from start to finish. :: we started either on time or very close to it and I was fine with it, nothing drastic. we used a lot of the class working on an in class part and then we used the rest of the time for open lab and that gave us the opportunity to ask questions about the homework. :: Class has always started on time, and the usually runs the full period. :: He mostly used the entire class period and we were able to stay longer to finish things up if we needed to. :: Yes. :: Class was always started on time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, really liked the open lab parts of class. It really helped to learn the material. :: Class always started on time, and the later parts of class were open lab most of the time, so students could leave if they were finished or stay and work until the end. :: Yes, he routinely started on time, but, since it was a long class period, he would do some examples at the beginning of class then let us have lab time to work on our design tasks. I appreciated how he divided the class time because its helpful to work on the design tasks with him and the TAs available."

Actually worked through the making of parts on SolidWorks with us when we came across difficult parts or assemblies to construct. :: Dr. B was always walking around the classroom ready to help anybody who needed the help. :: He would patrol the room and make sure everyone understood how to model whatever we were modeling. If we didn't, he would always stop to help. :: The instructor demonstrated his interest in learning well, as real world situations were presented during the class. :: Helped with my needs when I had scheduling conflicts. :: He would allow me to turn in some of my design task late if I was struggling.  He also did some of the more difficult parts of the design tasks in class so that everyone could get help on it if they needed to.  The open lab time during class was very useful as well. :: Dr. B would walk around while students were working and help them any way he could. He also would do demonstrations of harder parts to help everyone before we started and got stuck. :: Whenever I had questions he would answer them and verify that his explanation cleared up my confusion. :: Yes, this class was very fun and interesting!. :: Really good. :: with projects, design tasks, and interactions. :: He demonstrated interest in our learning by showing us how to do tasks he thought would be difficult beforehand, so then when we actually had to complete difficult tasks we were able to. :: He was very through in all of his explanations and was very willing to help when students were struggling. :: was very helpful in class with walking around and problem-solving issues in solidworks. :: He would always answer any questions we had. :: Design tasks were provided that usually took a week to complete. They were designed to use techniques that were learned from lecture that week, but while also stretching our abilities. :: He was always walking around the classroom to observe us during our lab time and engaged in conversation with us about our task ,and even gave us advice to remember for when we enter the workforce after graduation. :: The instructor was able to show me how to use Solidworks effectively and made my interest grow in the program. :: he is always ready and willing to answer questions and always explains were we went wrong and how we could have avoided it for next time. :: Dr. B periodically encircled the room to ensure all students understood the material. He did not rely solely on the TA's. :: yes. :: Yes. :: By letting us perform parts that we may use day to day. :: He seemed very interested and seemed fond of the material he was teaching. :: by always being available to help every student. :: He walks around and makes sure if anyone has questions that they get answered. :: He showed use what actual jobs and task people actually do in our work force. :: He routinely demonstrated to us what was needed for the assignments and always explained them fully. :: Craig made it feel like he did have interest in our learning.

I would have liked the schedule to be more organized so that I could balance my studying more effectively. :: Yes. :: Yes. Sometimes the due dates were confusing. Due dates were not always posted online. :: Yes. :: Sometimes. :: absolutely. :: Yes they were, he did a great job with that. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yep!. :: I didn't feel it was extremely organized. He basically followed another design and solid modeling class but seemed to pick and choose what we did as he went. :: Yes. :: very well organized. he made sure to go in depth when teaching a new skill. :: Both were organized and very well presented. :: yes. :: Lectures were excellent. Very relevant and helpful. The tasks were always quite manageable given the material covered in class. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, they were very well organized. :: yes with lots of help. :: Yes, I never had any questions about due dates or anything, they were always told to us and reminded us when they are. :: They were very organized and set, we able were able to accomplish what was needed give the time needed. :: Yes, the structure allowed us to learn the material in an excellent way. :: Yes the course was very well organized, I liked the time slots for all design tasks. Very reasonable time slots to get it done. :: Some of the design tasks had weird numbers and stuff on them that weren't super clear all the time but Dr. B always made sure to tell us that there was a mistake before we ran into it. Other than that it was pretty well organized. :: yes. :: yes and no, everything went fine and smoothly but it seemed all over the place at some points. :: Yes. :: The new tools were learned in class and were easy to follow. :: Yes. :: The course was very well organized. :: Yes. :: It was organized chaos. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, classes were always productive. Sometimes the pace was slow because students had questions but the lecture always finished. :: I think they were fairly well-organized. Sometimes it seemed a little scattered but I usually followed his train of thought."
3556,Craig Baudendistel,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: Yes. See above. :: Yes. :: Yes. Office hours were always available. :: Yes. :: YEs!. :: Didn't have to use them, he was always available in class. :: The instructor's availability was reasonable in all forms of communication. :: Did not attempt. :: Yes, he was, for the most part. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes he was. :: Yes, often when I was in the EGR help room he was in his office willing to answer questions. :: yes, very much so. :: Yes; I never used office hours or made an appointment, but Dr. B was exceptionally good with email communication. :: Yep!. :: Yes, he was very responsive. :: Yes. :: yes. He always responded to emails within a few hours and gave clear answers to the questions asked. :: Absolutely. :: yes. :: Dr. B was very accommodating. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he responded quickly and always made himself available. :: Yes always when needed. :: Yes. :: Didn't really see him during office hours or appointments, so don't really know. :: Yes. :: Yes he was very responsive. Emails were answered quick and accurate to my questions. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes he was very helpful outside of the classes and very kind about answering your questions. there was no dumb questions to him. :: Yes. :: He did respond to my emails. :: Yes. :: There were always available office hours with the TAs and Dr. B. :: Yes. :: Yes very. :: Yes. :: yes even out side of his office ours if you went to his office he made time to help. :: Yes. :: Yes, was always available and ready to help. :: Yes, he was quick to respond with my personal emails and was often available outside of class. :: Yes, he was available and was able to help outside of class."
3557,Craig Baudendistel,2016 Fall,ME 1040,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- fix and update the design tasks so they match up with the current gen so the directions match up correctly and make the design tasks actual have the drawing packages no just screen shots of them. :: This is second time taking class with Dr. Baudendistel.  I enjoy his teaching style and can tell he care about his students. :: I'm a transfer student, and this is my first full semester, I'm also a senior, and of all the classes I've taken, this is by far the best so far.  The cohesiveness was great, the tasks were challenging. This is an awesome introductory class to engineering and design. It's great that this course is offered at the the freshman level. I'm very impressed when comparing it to the equivalent of what I took at my previous university. :: Dr. B is one of the best professors ever.  He was very attentive to the class and made learning solidworks simple and fun. :: Hands down my favorite instructor this year. :: The instructor overall is a great teacher and encourages students and pushes them to perform at their best. :: I like your glasses. :: Dr. Baudendistel is the best professor I have ever had the honor to learn from. He is hands down the greatest person on this campus, and he looks great while he is doing it. 10/10 would recommend taking any class that Dr. B teaches. Thank You!. :: Great Job!. :: Maybe at certain points of the year we went a little too fast. :: He was a phenomenal instructor, I would highly recommend any student to take his course. :: no. :: I really enjoyed the class and the professor/TA's were very helpful and nice. The material was easy to keep up with and I learned a lot! If I would change anything, it would be helpful if somewhere on pilot/dropbox there was a list of exactly what was expected to be turned in for each design task (rather than occasional repetition in class) since the expectations rarely matched exactly what was in the instruction document on pilot. :: I think you should do another project instead of a final :^). :: I think this class will be much more organized now that he has taught it for a year. :: Nope. :: Overall very good teacher. I would recommend him as a  professor to anybody wanting to take this course. :: Both TA's were great with help.  If anything maybe another TA for help. :: He is awesome. :: Overall an excellent professor. Highly recommended. As a matter of fact, I chose to take a course taught by Dr. B again next semester. Great prof. Great guy. :: Good, TA's but could of used more. :: I really enjoyed this class and thought the professor and ta's were very knowledgeable and made the class great. I thought this class was very useful and fun!. :: No great instructor. :: This class was an awesome class, and I am glad I had the opportunity to take this. He is the best professor I have had yet. The TA's Jack and Matt where great as well. Anytime I emailed Jack he was quick to respond to them. Great in class as well. :: I think you ran the class very well. The class was very organized and you helped a lot! I think you should do this class the same way next time!. :: He is the best professor I have had at Wright State so far. :: i thought that Matt and Jack were both great and they along with Dr. B worked great as a team. :: He was a very good teacher and I hope to see him later on down the road in other classes!. :: I have thoroughly enjoyed this class and look forward to it every day. :: Good job. :: I really enjoyed the class and I think Dr. B did a great job. I learned a lot and was never uncomfortable asking a question or asking for help. :: This was an excellent and fun class that I truly enjoyed. :: No. :: I really enjoyed this class. :: an amazing teacher. :: This was my favorite class and does not require any change. Unless you can find away to make it more fun. :: My only suggestion would be to have more equal spacing for due dates for the design tasks. By that I mean have dates set in the syllabus and only change them if necessary. :: I thought he was a very excellent teacher in relating information and I feel very well acquainted with Solidworks. I think he prepared me for when I will need Solidworks in the future."
3558,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Good. :: Dr. Leiweke was the single most effective teacher i have had to date.  He taught more about my chosen field in one semester than i have learned my past two years attending Wright State.  He taught me about not only the industry I look forward to becoming apart of, but also his specific course and how they intertwined. :: Dr. Bob did a good job of taking only the good things from the book and going into more explanation where the book was lacking. He did however use a lot of repetitive examples, it made lectures harder to pay attention to. :: By far the most effective professor I have ever had. He took so much out of his personal time in order to make sure the whole class knew all the material. :: Overall, very effective professor. Taught the class very well and went above and beyond to make sure that the students really understood the material. A bit inappropriate at times people may say, but funny and entertaining. His goal is to create a relaxed learning environment. :: I loved Dr. Bob. He explained everything in the course very effectively and kept it simple. I learned more from Dr. Bob than any other professor I've had at Wright State. :: He routinely got distracted, although he really made a serious effort to help students understand material. :: He is good instructor and his class is fun and useful! :). :: Great instructor. :: very effictive. :: PERFECT. :: yes. :: Very effective, clear examples and slides posted online for student access. :: I wish you give Bob a lot of chances to teach the students in wright state, because he deserves it. :: . :: Dr. bob had his own lecture notes and hw problems which i found very helpful to learn the course rather than studying the book. :: The instructor condensed the book material into his own concentrated notes, which was very effective in my understanding of the material. :: not bad. :: He is one of the best professors I have ever seen. He cares a lot about his students. He is willing to answer any questions you have about the material. :: The teaching style is amazing, using his own notes and material based on the required curriculum. :: Quite effective. :: Professor Leiweke is very enthusiastic in what he does. He covers the course material very well and even gives real world applications to what we are learning. :: Dr. Bob went out of his way to put together coherent notes and to give plenty of examples and anecdotes to reinforce the material. His enthusiasm for the topic was very clear. :: The instructor was effective overall. :: Very effective. :: This professor was not very effective. :: Effective. :: Effective by getting you to remember material with funny comparisons or jokes. :: He was very efficient. :: He is a nice guy, but his lectures are not very organized."
3559,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes. :: Dr. Leiweke was strict to his syllabus and how he wanted work presented and turned in and he stayed consistent with those expectations which was a strong lesson within it's self. however he was easy going and reasonable on helping students continue to progress. :: I was satisfied with how my work was evaluated. :: Yes, he was clear and consistant. :: Yes. :: The syllabus was a little confusing, only because it was changed so often. All work expected however was evaluated fairly. :: yes but he changed the syllabus 7 or 8 times which made it confusing. :: Yes, he does. :: yes. :: yes. :: PERFECT. :: yes. :: yes. :: . :: yes, he did. :: Yes, the instructor evaluate my work as described. :: no. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. He followed the syllabus despite changing it several times. Although he always told us what changes he had made to the syllabus. :: There could have been more feedback from the student graders, often there would be just points marked off with minimal explanation. Dr. Bob's grading was crystal-clear. :: Yes, the instructor did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes, he also changed the syllabus many times. This isn't bad thing becuase it was always updated."
3560,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: It was always on time and even sometimes early if you showed up early.  Often times he would have real life discussions about the applications of the course in the industry to further engage the students. :: he would never really start class late, but sometimes early. he also kept us over a few times but other than that he generally made good use of class time. :: Yes, class time was used fully. :: Yes. :: Dr. Bob started on time every time. He also went over the class period many times. (This may be because the clock in the room is broken). :: yes. :: Yes. And more than the full period sometimes. XD. :: yes. :: yes. :: PERFECT. :: yes. :: yes. :: . :: yes, he did. :: Yes, the instructor was prompt and used time effectively. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, was on time every class, and utilized the class period to best of his ability. :: Yes. :: Yes. He always started on time and went the full length of the period. :: I don't recall leaving early more than twice or so, and not significantly. :: Yes, he did start the class routinely on time and he use more than the full class period. :: Yes. :: No class started late and ended late. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes, and thanks to the clock in the room he would run class over 7 minutes every day."
3561,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- Encouraged students to take advantage of office hours. :: He had immense interest.  He was always ready to go the extra mile if need be for the students understanding. :: yes. :: There was so much interest in teaching us that it was surprising. Most instructors that I have taken had no interest in whether the class learned or not. I can confidently say that I won't be forgetting everything once the semester is finished. :: He took time to make sure that the students understood the material by giving real-world examples that engineers face in everyday situations. That is a great way to go about teaching, instead of purely theoretical-based notes. :: Dr. Bob was willing to answer any questions about thermodynamics at any time. :: he made it interesting. :: Good. :: yes. :: examples. :: PERFECT. :: he is good. :: real life engineering examples. :: . :: he taught the course from his lecture notes ad made sure that students left the class knowing what thermodynamics is. :: The instructor kept things light, making the mood less serious and boring. :: no. :: His notes are the best. It makes the material more clear. :: He was very involved with the students during the class, and did his best to actually teach us, instead of just trying to get lectures done. :: He emphasized what we had to fulfill to be successful in class and in life. :: He tried to get to know his students as people. He was very friendly and made it clear that he wanted us all to try our hardest because he wanted to see us succeed. :: The extra examples or demonstrations (taking some time to show turbines and their applications, for example) were appreciated. :: Yes, the instructor did demonstrate interest in my learning. :: By being enthusiastic and interested in what he was teaching. :: Yes. :: He kept it positive and acted like he was enjoying himself.  Put in extra effort for the students. :: He was there to help. :: He did offer to meet with anyone who needed help."
3562,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Good. :: He communicated well and in a timely manner however his lectures could be a little more structured.,. :: he got the material across better than most, and as far as I know he was able to communicate if I needed him. :: Communication was very good, all questions were always answered. I never left confused. :: Fairly effective. :: Dr. Bob would send an email every time he uploaded a lecture. :: he could be a bit rude via email. :: Same communication. He's very nice. :: yes. :: very effective. :: PERFECT. :: good. :: very responsive to email. :: Always reply to my emails. :: . :: he was available for office hours and email. :: The instructor answered questions in class and was available after, as well. :: yes. :: He is willing to give an extra time to reply to the emails and answers any questions you have after the class. :: Very very well. His response time to the emails was very quick, and even offered a personal phone number to reach him in case of emergencies. :: On a scale of 0-9, 8. :: Professor Leiweke was adept at communicating in the classroom and sent numerous emails to keep us updated out of the classroom. :: Office hours at 9PM right after class are far from optimal. This isn't Dr. Bob's fault, and it is to his credit that he made the effort. CECS and WSU need to provide better support and infrastructure to adjuncts if they are indeed going to be reliant on adjunct instructors. Pay the man enough to justify coming in for additional office hours, and provide some level of office space. Again, we managed due to his willingness to stick around after class, but that's not a sustainable arrangement. :: The instructor did communicate effectively in and out of the classroom. :: Very. :: Well. :: Good communication.  Emailed quite consistently. :: He was very good in getting his message across. :: He would always email, and make announcements when anything changes."
3563,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: One critique I would give to Dr. Leiweke is to refine his notes and paperwork before posting them for students.  Often times he would find mistakes in his previously made notes that he would have to edit on the fly and there were always updates to pilot and emails saying I fixed this or re wrote that ""a new copy is posted to pilot"".  It became confusing sifting through all the variations to find the correct one.  Another would be instead of reading through previously worked out problems from his notes, do them by hand on the board and work through it with the students. :: I liked the way he presented the material, but it seemed like he was still getting his lectures in order. he redid a portion near the end of the class and there were many calculation mistakes in the reorganized part. :: Very well organized. :: Yes, it can be seen that the instructor cares and takes pride in his teaching. His notes are constantly being modified and simplified. :: The content was well laid out and very clear. :: not all the time but most of the time. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: PERFECT. :: good. :: . :: yes it was. :: No, the course content felt a little disorganized and there was a lot all at once. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, the notes were in an order that made them very easy to follow, and understand all the key concepts required to do well in the class. I didn't find any need to find other sources to learn the material. :: Yes. :: Yes. His lecture notes were very organized and helped very much. :: The lectures were nicely organized and we received email notifications of any change. :: Yes the course content and lectures were well organized. :: Yes. :: No. :: He changed the notes a lot, but it was for the better to make positive changes. :: Yes it was. :: No, not necessarily. Students would have to search for a while through the notes and lectures just to find the information that is relevant to the problem at hand."
3564,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Very responsive and he made himself extremely available for questions. :: he was available when he could be. we had to make a few compromises, but he was willing to work with students where necessary. :: yes. :: Yes, for the most part. Sometimes though, I emailed him and he never responded, but very seldomly did that happen. I did not like that he had his office hours right after class,  9:00 pm - 10:00 pm. This was a major issue for me because the following mornings I had class at 8:00 am, so I could never stay and ask questions because I wanted to go home and go straight to bed in order to get an adequate amount of sleep. :: N/a. :: yes. :: Yes. So much!!. :: yes. :: yes. :: PERFECT. :: good. :: yes. :: . :: yes, he was. :: Yes,. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes he was available when needed even thou he didn't even have his own office. :: Yes. :: Yes. He was available to meet after every class to ask any questions we had, sometimes staying an hour past class was over to help. :: I didn't stick around for office hours much, but by all accounts he was easy to reach. :: Yes, the instructor was reasonably available and responsive outside of class. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was. :: Yes, He always responded to emails."
3565,Bob Leiweke,2016 Fall,ME 3310,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Dr. Leiweke is hands down my in my top two teachers ive had here at Wright State because he is a bit unorthodox but really relates to his students.  He treats his students as if they were professionals already and gives us respect that i really haven't seen in my time here. That alone makes me want to work harder and earn that respect for myself. :: please stop talking about pig pen. this isn't about it being something nobody cares about, but the repetitiveness made me tune out. :: I wish he would teach Thermo II as well. :: Overall, I give him an effective rate of 95%. :: I hope Dr. Bob continues to teach at Wright State because he is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. :: The instructor needed a TA/s in the class. The class is big, and he had to take our exams, quizzes, and homework to the department after gradind, so that we could go and pick them up.  He is very good instructor. :: thanks. :: PERFECT. :: yes. :: . :: Best wright state teacher. :: None. :: Basically, he is the best. :: What is the difference between thermodynamics and a stick? A stick has two ends and no beginning. Thermodynamics has two âbeginningsâ (the first and second law) and no end. :: Best professor ever. :: Dr. Bob made a potentially dry topic interesting. In fact, I went for an interview at a local compressor manufacturer and managed to use some of his lecture notes to refresh and brush up to prepare for any technical questions. I think that says it all. :: No, I do not have any additional comments. :: No. :: As well as you liked Don Knotts from the Andy Griffith show, you should watch the apple dumpling gang with Tim Conway and Don Knotts as the main characters. :: He was a good professor"
3566,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- not very effective. :: I feel like this instructor could improve in effectiveness. Could do a better job gaining the interest of the class. :: Good instructor, didn't learn well with the structure of the class. :: he helps us understand the material by making us reading the book and commenting. and he takes the questions we ask and lecture on them for more understanding. :: I did not feel that they were effective at all teaching us the material.  We basically were expected to learn all the material ourselves by reading the textbook and answering each others questions.  The lectures were also not helpful and the information covered did not seem to apply to our homework or quiz's. :: With the in-class exercises, group quizzes, and homework discussions, he made the class easy for us. :: This teacher was consistently ineffective at communicating material to his students, consistently unable  to submit files and upload documents needed for homework assignments. Very frustrating overall, I walk away from this class not having learned anything, but how to struggle through homework and barely pass quizzes. Not what I paid for. :: Better as the year went on. :: I think Raghu was an effective instructor. I am not sure the way that the class was setup was though. I found it a little hard to learn. :: Very great class spook very clear to the students and made sure we understood the topic. Also loved the way the class was set up. :: He was an ok instructor. :: Not good. :: Overall, Dr. S was an effective professor.  I feel relatively confident about my knowledge relating to this course, though I chalk it more up to a lacking on my part, more so than anything lacking on Dr. S's end. :: . :: Not effective. Would have learned more in five minutes with a Learning Assistant than I ever learned from this professor. :: The instructor was not capable of commanding the attention of the students, with the out of class reading and annotations being the majority of the work in the class, and taught through power points so it is not a very effective teaching method. :: He had a large amount of knowledge on the subject and was effective at explaining. :: somewhat effective. :: The lessons that he taught were communicated pretty effectively. However, he did not always cover the topics that were read about, and these I had trouble understanding. :: He was clearly knowledgeable of the material, but the classroom style was ineffective with my learning process. :: Srinivasan was not an effective teacher what so ever. I learned absolutely nothing this semester in his structures and properties of mathematics class. I know the material the class covers is not the most interesting topic, but his class was something else. Every time he would go to lecture, it would be over the annotations/readings we had completed before the class. He wouldn't give any additional information on how to complete actual problems. When our class would go to complete exercise problems, he would walk around and not answer any questions our table had. :: moderate at best- the ""scale up"" class format as practiced at wright state leads to an over reliance on technology, which can be finicky to say the least.  Making the class size much smaller would also help. :: The instructor, from what I have heard about the other sections of this same class, was much more effective with his teaching method (requiring that the students read and annotate). The only thing I could recommend to make the material 'stick' even more is to have more quizzes (one for every chapter). :: Not very effective. He expected us to understand some pretty difficult material by only reading the book, which was poorly written in my opinion. When it came time for lecture, he would basically reiterate what the book said, and wouldn't explain any further. :: I thought Dr. S, wasn't that effective. He had do a lot of readings in the book, which was fine, but most of the students truly didn't understood what they were reading because we were reading the book to get all the points for the readings versus reading the book to understand it. This contributed to the fact that Dr. S was not very effective because, again most students didn't understand the readings, then we'd come in and not get a good lecture and then were expected to do problems that we had no clue where to start then on top of all of it, he'd give quizzes in which the graduate teaching assistance had some troubles on a few quizzes, most of students would fail the quizzes. :: He was okay. :: Raghu was very effective in structuring the class in a way to optimize student learning as long as the students were motivated to do it. :: He was effective in teaching us this semseter. :: Decently effective professor. The teaching style was not necessarily the best due to online annotations and technology issues as well as some communication issues as to when annotations were do. Besides this, instructor was relatively effective. :: Great. :: Relatively effective. :: He's very knowledgeable, unfortunately, I feel the structure of the class hinders his effectiveness in being able to communicate the subject matter. :: Instructor was very effective. The instructor was passionate and very knowledgeable about the topic. He presented topics in an easy to understand way and really cared about students learning the topic. This was a very enjoyable course. :: I was not happy with this professor's teaching style, or how the class was structured. :: Very dedicated teacher, you don't find professors like this anymore. He took the time to make straightforward PowerPoints for lectures and made sure you had plenty of time to work with your group. :: Slightly effective, most learning done out of class"
3567,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, I loved how organized the class syllabus was. Very easy to plan the semester. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: only one thing he changed that was not on the syllabus that costed me some points which is if you were absent in the day of homework submition  you lose half of the homework grade ans a penalty + you lose the point for being absent in that day which doesn't make sense specially if my reason of being absent is something serious to me but because i don't have a papered excuse then he doesn't actually care about that, while if i go to a hospital and act sick to get an excuse he would take that one. and as i said that was not stated in the syllabus. :: NO!!! A computer automatically graded our annotations which were a large portion of our grade and we never knew which annotations were good and which ones were not.  Also we never found out which questions which missed on quizzes which were also automatically graded by clickers that did not work most of the time. :: Yes. :: Yes, the syllabus stated that work would be graded upon effort and completion, and it was. :: yes. :: Yes he did. :: Yes for the most part followed the syllabus to the T but towards the end he did revise the syllabus which kinda made things a little confusing but in the end it was for the better. :: yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: . :: Yes. :: Yes, work was evaluated and graded fairly. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, the syllabus was the class guideline. :: Yes, work was evaluated due to specifications of the syllabus. :: Yes, he is very straight forward with his expectations. :: mostly- it seems that the chaos inherent to the ""scale up"" format inevitably leads to a certain amount of chaos, which leads to delays, which necessitated the removal of a chapter of study from the original curriculum. :: The instructors grading/evaluation was aligned with the syllabus and it also helped us learn the material more giving us a grade for reviewing our own mistakes and work. (very effective technique). :: Yes. :: Yes, Dr. S evaluated us exactly how it was stated in the syllabus. :: Somewhat. Some points that were missed were really stupid points that were almost taken off because he felt like it. :: Yes, the syllabus workload was very similar to the workload of the class. :: Yes, he evaluated us on what he expected us to know. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: I think we was very unfair with the grading of the annotations. It was impossible to get a decent grade in those and he never told us what we were doing wrong. Otherwise, it was fair. :: Yes, clear grading criteria"
3568,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: No a lot of times there were technical difficulties so class started very late he also let us out early most days especially toward the end of the semester. :: Yes. :: No, professor continually took time at the start of class to struggle to set up computer and technology services, which were not necessary to the instruction. :: yes. :: Yes, he always started on time. The only time that he did not was when there was a technical difficulty with the computers. :: Yes for the most part would start class on time but there were a few times he was running late to class and wouldn't show up till about 5-10 minutes into the class time and would spend another 5 min trying to get the power point up and running. :: Usually he would start class about 5 minutes after the start time. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: . :: Does not always start on time. :: Yes, the instructor began class exactly on time and always used the full class period. :: yes. :: yes. :: Yes, we used our entire class periods. :: Class mostly began and ended on time. :: Yes. :: somewhat- the scale up chaos induced several protracted delays while power pint presentations had to be reset or the test taking software rebooted.  It felt like a lot of in class time was wasted in activities other than presenting or exploring the material. :: The instructor attempted to start the class on time every period but there were a few technological difficulties that occasionally prevented us from starting on time. :: Sometimes he would start a few minutes late, but it was usually due to technical issues. :: Yes, Dr. S would start class on time every time. :: Sometimes, other times he would start 5 minutes late, but he used all the class time every class. :: Yes, class time was well spent in groups doing exercises or learning new material. :: Yes, always on time, always the full period. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
3569,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He brought in things to demonstrate what we were talking about in class which I thought was really cool. Visual demonstrations are really helpful. :: well, answered questions and did best to find out what students were struggling with. :: By having the us review our homework and seeing what we did wrong. :: Assigning homework reflections so we could learn from our mistakes. :: yes. :: He didn't.  He did not grade our homework or really interact with us inside or outside of class.  He also did not seem to care that a lot people who were doing the annotations were not doing well on them and that most of the class was struggling on their equations. :: He did not, assumed that forcing students to take copious numbers of annotations would somehow relate to the students learning and understanding. :: Good. :: yes. :: He would bring in models to show us some of the structures or materials that we were talking about. :: Wanted the class to be more hands on with the people and always brought in objects to better explain what he was trying to teach to us. :: He would have us do problems with our groups usually every week to two weeks and would walk around and answer questions. :: The whole class was struggling heavily about halfway through the semester, so the syllabus was changed specifically to give us more time on a few vital topics. :: . :: Did not portray interest. :: The instructor answered all of the questions brought up in perusall discussion which lead to a better understanding of material that was not easy to learn. :: yes. :: brought in models to demonstrate material which was helpful. :: He would bring in models to aid in our understanding. :: He made slides of the lectures available on pilot. :: Not really. He wouldn't help us on the exercise problems he assigned in class or give a clear explanation on our homework problems. :: yes- very energetic and personable.  I think he would be very effective in a more intimate setting or in a lecture style environment. :: The instructor asked for questions multiple times every lecture (more than any instructor I currently have) due to the difficulty of the material. :: He seemed like he somewhat cared about my learning, but it was hard to tell. :: Dr. S demonstrated his interest in my learning by walking around the classroom helping with homework sets and wanting us to understand it. :: He cared a lot because homework was graded very fairly, and you go to practically redo it and turn it back in for full credit. :: The instructor spent time observing our on-line comments and tailoring his lecture to them which shows his care. :: He always asked if we had questions, and put together power point slides on things that people were confused about. :: Tried to explain concepts from the previous assignments, but didn't work out very well. The instructor did try though. :: Making the class interactive. :: Demonstrated much interest in my learning. :: I'm guessing that's the purpose that the reflections served. :: By answering all questions and making himself readily available to help any student in need. :: Yes. :: He definitely did. He would even bring in samples from home to show us how things worked. Very good professor. :: He and LA's made sure we understood before moving on, spent class time focusing on students' questions over material."
3570,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- well. :: Communicated effectively both in and out of the classroom. :: Well. :: good. :: Not well he would rather email us and then he would send us like three emails in a day.  He also didn't really interact with us inside the class room. :: Very good. :: Poorly, read information off of slides as if students were not capable of reading on their own, frustrated students by not explaining what was meant by information. Most disappointed. :: pretty well. :: He was effective. :: Communicated very well to the class. :: well. :: Very effectively. :: . :: Emailed occasionally. :: The instructors communication in and out of the class room was neither good or bad. :: well. :: sent  emails as reminders. :: He was pretty effective, I just wish he would have covered more of the material in class, rather than just assigning outside reading for most of the topics. :: He made sure to back up any information with an email. :: I did not try to contact him outside of the classroom. Within the classroom, He didn't really communicate with us. He just talked to us (lecture). :: good. :: The instructor had the students attempt to answer each others questions through the online textbook before each class period and then answered the most asked and unanswered questions in the following period (quite helpful). :: Not very well. You would ask him a question and he wouldn't understand what you meant. :: Dr. S was very effective in his communications in and out of the classroom. :: He communicated fairly, id be a little confused about what was going on here and there, but overall it was not too bad. :: Professor did a good job of communicating any changes in the syllabus or material. :: He communicated great in the class room, not so well out though. :: Tried to but communication as to when certain things were due could have been better. :: Very well. :: Well. :: I feel like he could have been more effective had the class been setup differently. :: Very well. :: Poorly. :: He would reply to an email within a few hours, so very well. :: Very well through e-mail and in class reminders"
3571,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: For the most part. The majority of the lecture and reading was conceptual with some example problems and the quizzes were conceptual, but the homework was all math problems. It would have been more beneficial to have the homework be conceptual, so I could better understand the content, than to include specific math problems that didn't benefit my understanding. :: yes. :: No.  Since it was a flipped classroom we were expected to learn most of the material ourselves and when he did give lectures the information did not really apply to our homework or quizzes. :: Yes. :: No, class seemed to jump around from point to point, and did not demonstrate a cohesiveness expected in a collegiate classroom. :: yes. :: Yes, he tried to answer our questions that we made online to ensure that we understood the material and the concept of the material. :: Yes lectures would be tailored to what we didn't understand in the readings and made sure we understood what was going on. :: yes. :: Yes. :: . :: No. not at all. No organization within the class. :: The course content was almost entirely self - teaching through reading and annotations, and while organized, does not promote learning new and complicated material. :: They were but the class is meant to be a flip class where there isn't much lecturing and there is a focus on group learning but it wasn't that hardly at all. It was mostly long lectures about material that most of the class had read days ago. This made class time very stale sometimes but he did do a good job of trying to make sure that every student had a clear understanding. :: yes, followed syllabus provided. :: Yes, we had a schedule and stayed on it. :: The followed the plan by chapters, but the lectures were not greatly representative of quizzes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: The course content was organized very well and defined in the course schedule. :: Not really. At the beginning of the semester, he said that it wouldn't be a class where he lectured a lot. But after a couple of weeks passed, that's all he did.  There was also a point in time where he had to totally change the schedule because we were so behind. Our annotations were generally due on Monday nights and Wednesday nights, but every once in awhile, they would be due on Friday, Saturday, or even Sunday, so it was hard to keep track of what we had to do. :: For the most part, the content was definitely organized but the lectures would not always organized. :: On paper it looked well organized, but in reality, not really. :: Yes, most of the material was online and easy to follow and access. :: Yes, everything was organized and easy to use and find. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: The course content was organized, the lectures didn't really feel cohesive to me. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, everything was organized. :: Course content yes, some lectures were slightly broken from TurningPoint clicker malfunctions"
3572,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: No. :: Yes. :: No. :: I did not attend office hours or anything like that. :: Never needed him outside of class or emailed him. :: I never needed to contact him outside of the classroom. :: Yes. :: . :: Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: I never really tried to reach him, but he did communicate with us effectively via email. :: Yes, he was easily reached by email. :: Never tried to contact him outside of the classroom. :: did not use office hours- online presence was good. :: As previously stated the instructor was able to use the online book to figure out what students were struggling with and then answered/extrapolated on the topics in the following period. :: I never needed to contact him outside of class. :: Yes, he was available quite often. :: Yes he was reasonably available and was very helpful when asked a question. :: Yes, professor was quick to respond to any student inquiries or problems with the material or homework. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes"
3573,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 2700,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I know this class is still working out kinks as a scale up, so it was hard to start class on time while trying to get all the software up. If anyone complains about the annotations, the instructor had examples for us at the beginning of the course and told us to do at least five per reading. It was easy to get good scores on them if you followed the examples he had set. I would suggest adding a couple conceptual questions into the homework (on top of the other problems) this would help kids prepare for the quizzes. I know I struggled with the quizzes sometimes because they covered a lot of material (which is fine since, that meant less quizzes.). :: lectured in class for too long for a scale up class, nobody payed attention didnt actually learn very much but will come out of class with a or b. :: Instructor could do a better job gaining the class' attention and interest. :: The annotations weren't set up well. Some sections were around 10 pages, which wasn't enough content for around 20 students to include 5 or more annotations on. Some sections were 30+ pages which took over 3 hours to read and annotate, which seemed excessive when there were two to three annotation/reading assignments due each week. :: I hated the flipped classroom.  I feel like I did not learn anything, and what I did learn I had to teach myself.  The computer automatically grading the annotations was ridiculous and so were the quizzes, especially considering they didn't even work half of the time. The clickers were a waste of money.  I also have trouble reading online textbooks so I hated that we had to read that one.  I much rather would have had a physical textbook. :: Please learn to teach in a scale up classroom, this was terrible. :: nope. :: I enjoyed his end course project which was fun and enjoyable. He was a really nice guy and was easy to talk to or even go to. I did not go to him outside of class but I would not have had a problem with it. :: Overall loved the way the class was set up and a very wonderful teacher who wanted the best for us. :: The lectures were quite boring and I don't really feel like I've learned all that much throughout the class but I do think the professor genuinely wants students to learn. I think the class would benefit from more interactive learning methods and more interesting presentations. :: . :: This class was a complete joke. Did not learn a solitaire thing. Was never taught anything. Made to do annotations that were online and this was the only way to ""learn"". Professor rarely lectures and when he does he is so monotone and boring class does not pay attention. :: Perusall and ""Clickers"" are not a good way to teach.  The clickers hardly work, the software associated with them, responseware, hardly works, and Perusall, while a good way to provide the book, does not help students to understand things, they simply read because they have to but do not learn. It is also not a good idea to not have tests, as the level of knowledge in the class is very low, but is not tested, so everyone will pass. :: No. :: the ebook used was horrible.  I know the allure of being able to monitor and track students progress through the material, but the software used (perusal) was buggy, its grading algorithm was not transparent, and its search system never worked, making it hard to do the in class activities and homework.  just try scrolling from the section you are on to a table in the back of the book and back in a time efficient manner.  It was more effective to google the information I needed, which then begs the question as to why do we need this ebook except as a study tracker, and if that is all it is why is it so expensive?. :: I don't think the way that this class was set up really worked well--maybe for another subject, but not something as difficult to understand as this. I liked the idea of group work, but we never really did much of that. I didn't like the Perusall annotations at all. I think I would have learned much more if we didn't have to basically teach ourselves. :: No. :: No further comments. :: No. :: No. :: This class is the definition of technology overload. As far as education is concerned, I do believe there are ways that technology can enhance learning, but there are also ways in which it can get in the way. This class was a very good example of how technology gets in the way.  I think going forward, it'd be best to change the structure of the class. Lose the annotations, along with clicker quizzes and the reflections. It might be a good idea to have the class flow in a way similar to the Solidworks classes. The teacher lectures for the first 30 minutes or so, then allow the students to work through some of the related homework problems. Then perhaps the teacher lectures for another 30 minutes. After that the rest of class time is spent allowing the groups to work through the homework. Homework is given on Monday, with a due date of Wednesday the following week perhaps. Each lecture will function as time for the professor to teach new material and then open ""lab"" time for students to work through homework. Each student must submit his or her own homework, but there's time given to collaborate in solving the problems with extra time out of class to work on it. The quizzes would be taken the day the homework is turned in. There can still be the individual and group quizzes, but they can be given on the laptops through Pilot rather than having to use a clicker. I don't understand the point of having students purchase clickers and a license to do what the classroom itself is already designed to do with the use of the laptops at every table. Especially when many of the students have to make the purchase that will only be used for just that semester and that class. I feel like there wasn't enough thought put into that decision. The annotations are worse. Requiring the students to purchase/rent a text that they can only access online just to take notes? In addition, there's no feedback on what the student didn't succeed at if they receive a score less than the full amount. It basically turned into skimming, looking for keywords, then googling and copying and paste stuff just to get points. It doesn't actually encourage the student to learn.  I think it's important to remember that sometimes ""simple"" is a good thing. There was too much going on with this class that it felt disjointed. I know it wasn't the intention, but it made it hard to follow along and absorb the material. Too much time was wasted waiting for the professor to figure out how to get something to work properly. That was time that could have been spent lecturing. Overall, I feel like I learned less than if it had just been a simple lecture with homework and tests. :: No. :: Thank you for actually caring whether or not we learned. :: no"
3574,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- In this type of classroom setting, I didn't find Dr. Srinivasan's teaching style to be very effective. :: Dr. S teaches well and I enjoyed his class. Needs to do more examples. My classmates and I requested more in-class examples to work through problems and we never got them. Made the homework hard as well as the quizzes. :: Dr. Srinivasan was very good at lecturing over the subject. The only thing that was not effective with this class was the flipped classroom approach. This approach did not aid in my learning because just reading the book and seeing no examples of the material that we read is just a memorization exercise. In order for this class to be more effective, there needs to be more lectures and example problems given in class. The quizzes need to be based on what is lectured as well as what is in the homework and not just random parts of chapters. Some of the problem were purely a guessing game at some points, since the phrase had been rooted deep in the chapter in a place that was very easy to skip over. Overall, great professor but bad class setup. :: Not effective, lectures were scrambled and didn't learn much from them. :: Lenient. :: He's a good instructor, but I wish I didn't have to learn out of a book. Reference material is great for getting familiar with the information, but knowledge gleaned from it tends to leak and decay if it is not immediately taken from the world of dense textbooks and put in practical terms."
3575,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 2,"Did the instructor evaluate your work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus?--- Yes, except it felt like he didn't really grade our annotations. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Assumed quizzes were going to be 5% per, but some were weighted much heavier causing them to have higher impact on grade without knowledge before the quiz being taken. :: yes. :: Exactly as in the syllabus."
3576,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 3,Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes. :: yes. :: Yes.
3577,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- He set aside class time for working on homework in groups and would help in the discussions if we were stuck. :: It was easy to pick out when he was particularly interested in a subject because he would bring up specific design challenges that he had seen before. It always helps when a professor is able to relate what we are learning to the real world. :: yes. :: Didn't. :: coincided materials. :: He answered questions. I had nothing too much more than that to bring to his attention, so I cannot really pass a judgement."
3578,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- He communicated well. :: Sent out emails too late about quizzes. Students would not have time to study or react to a change or surprise he put on the quiz. :: He communicated well both inside and out. :: Not well, assignments due dates were changed without notice, causing lots of people to miss those assignments with no response from the professor. :: well spoken. :: He communicated well. Questions were answered clearly and emails were also clear."
3579,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- There weren't really any lectures, which to me was disappointing. I had heard that he was a great instructor from other students who had taken this class with him before it was changed to flipped learning style. With Perusall, the confusion reports it generates aren't really as good a judge of where students are struggling because if students are graded on the content of their annotations, they tend to comment more on the parts that they understand better. It was hard to figure out how well we needed to know parts of the material because there were no lectures to guide us. :: Yes, the book is a work in progress but overall it was organized well. :: No, the ""lectures"" were just going over what annotations within the book had the most confusion and then talking about parts of the chapter. Since we had to read 10-15 pages per assignment and annotate, a lot of annotations were done with the intent of getting it done. Since everything was group based with homework and quizzes, it did not give any kind of incentive for us to read and thoroughly understand the chapter on our own. This was also the case because even if we did read it, we would come into class and have it be re read to us. In order for this class to be as beneficial as it should be, there needs to be key points hit at the beginning of the semester of what the main aspects of metals are structurally, and do a revisit to structures and properties then proceed to the mechanical testing and properties and come back to why things work based on the structure. This class just did not help me learn in a coherent fashion of what the behavior of metals is supposed to be. :: No. :: yes. :: Yes, as far as the inverted classroom model allows."
3580,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: yes. :: Did not need him."
3581,Raghavan Srinivasan,2016 Fall,ME 4770,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- I am not sure grading is going to be fair in this class. a lot of students are worried about their grades because it seems we were trying to hit a movie target when it came to how, specifically, homework and annotations were graded. I am not sure I agree with how perusall grades annotations and more time needs to be taken by the instructor to understand comments that are made. Perusall might even have hindered us as students because we were more worried about trying to please perusall with our comments rather than learn the subject in our own way and make it stick. Also, with such a small class, groups are hard to divide fairly. There were only 4 teams in this class and 2 seemed to far outweigh the others. This seems unfair as you are now relying on your group to teach you instead of the instructor. :: Stop doing Perusall. Stop flipped classroom. :: He used a scale up approach and I think this shows an interest in our learning. The effectiveness of this approach might not be as good as it could be but I think it's a step in the right direction. :: Due to the teaching style of this course, this has been my least favorite course of my entire bachelors degree. The flipped classroom was something I was not prepared for, and when the questions were asked, the answers given were not great. They went around the question instead of getting to the point. Mandatory group quizzes and assignments cause some people in the course to get free rides to better grades. Book was not complete, and information in the book was not concise enough. :: I want to express a general sentiment of displeasure with inverted classrooms. It's a good idea in principle, but flawed in practice. Other than that, good luck with getting your book finished, and thank you for the good semester."

She gives fair tests and homeworks. Her expectations of the students is very fair. :: Very effective at conveying the curriculum of this course. :: presents well. :: The instructor was very effective in their teaching style and aided in learning through an effective combination of informative presentation slides and additional verbal information. :: Prof. Huang taught the class very well because of how organized and structured her class was. With this, the class was always on course with the syllabus and dates provided for tests and homework. Prof. Huang teaches the class effectively as well by only providing what is needed for us to know on the subject to use in homework and for our tests as well. Prof. Huang is one of the best professors I've had here at Wright State because of these qualities about her and the classes she teaches. :: effective. :: Good. :: Dr. Huang is a fantastic instructor! Things that I really enjoyed that she did: * Posting power points on pilot - This made it easier to go back and review the information in class. * Writing all important notes on the board. - I always knew exactly what to write down in class because she always makes it clear as to what is important and writes it on the board.   * Going over plenty of examples - The examples in class were always very helpful for the homework. * Homework is based on class notes - We were always given sufficient notes to do the homework  * She made it very clear as to what was important in the class. All of the notes Dr. Huang wrote on the board were helpful and relevant to the class information. * Go over solutions to homework - Going over homework gave us the chance to ask questions about problems and Dr. Huang always made sure we understood before moving on.  Overall I really enjoyed this class and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot from this class this semester. I am really glad that I chose to take Dr. Huang. :: Some materials were not well defined and not all students understood what was going on but the professor kept going on. :: Lectures were very well structured and Prof. Huang did a great job of engaging the class.  She took the extra time to review topics and do example problems in class.  I was very happy with this course. :: Very helpful and learnt a lot in the class."

She would have the same will to let us learn even when she is busy. :: Always available at office hours, gave reminder emails about assignments and exams. :: leaving the end of statements opened to be answered by students. :: All communication both in and out of class was highly effective. :: Prof. Huang always kept in touch with us through emails if lectures were going to be changed to a different topic or about anything that dealt with tests or homework. The line of communication was always open. :: effectivly. :: Kind of hard to understand at times. :: Dr. Huang is fantastic at communicating in and out of the classroom.

3598,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 1,"Describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor.--- Great job!!. :: He was effective. :: Overall, it is good. :: I think he was a great professor. I think he challenged us in the course, but was always willing to help when we got stuck. I think his website was very helpful in keeping all of his notes, codes, and homework in one place. :: Very effective, but he has to realise a lot of persons left undergrad a long time ago. And so, he should try to be as simple as possible to carry everyone along. :: Very effective. :: Great!. :: In my opinion, Dr. Slater could have been more effective as an instructor. He seemed to be very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but did not effectively transfer that knowledge to the class. He stressed the importance of asking questions, but would often playfully belittle students who asked questions. I think this discouraged more students from asking questions freely."

I am not sure from the projects evaluation yet. :: I'm not sure - I wish he would have returned grades for the class.If he passed back the homework it would have been beneficial for studying for exams. Also, we did not get any project grades back. Since it was worth 40% of our grade, it would have been nice to know where we stood in the class.  I'm probably just being too picky - I'm the type who likes to know exactly where I stand in the class grade wise and it was a tad frustrating not knowing where I stood in the class. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes!. :: As far as I know at this time, yes. We submitted a few homework assignments, two projects, and have taken two tests. We are in the last week of classes and have only received the two tests back from him."
3600,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 3,"Did the instructor routinely start class on time and use the full class period?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes, he used the entire class period and made everyone's time worthwhile. :: Yes. :: Yes, he did. :: Yes!. :: Yes."
3601,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 4,"How did the instructor demonstrate interest in your learning?--- By wanting to answer all of our questions. :: He answered questions in class. :: He did it in a good way. :: Yes! You could tell he wanted all of his student to succeed. He gave us practice exams for each exam so we could have an idea how the problem would be setup. He always answered any of our questions to the best of his ability. :: Well. :: He made three projects working in group to inspire the interest of student. :: Yes!. :: Yes, he made himself available outside of class, allowed for questions during class periods, and briefly reviewed exam questions to ensure that we understood our mistakes."
3602,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 5,"How effectively did the instructor communicate both in and out of the classroom?--- Great. :: He communicated well. :: Great. :: Yes! He made himself very approachable inside and outside of class. He always returned student's emails in a very timely manner and had a website where we could make appointments to meet with him. He was always willing to help!. :: Always. :: It was effective. He answered questions pretty well. :: 5 on 5. :: Dr. Slater communicated well. He maintained good lecture notes. He made his past exams available for review. However, as stated before, he was often condescending and sometimes overtly offensive to students in the classroom."
3603,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 6,"Were the course content and lectures well organized?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Not that much. :: Yes, he had the notes for the entire semester posted online the very first day of class. He stayed on schedule with all the lectures. He also set aside days for us to work on homework and our projects in groups. This allowed us to work on the problems during class and could ask him any questions we came across. :: Yes. :: Yes, they were. :: Very well. :: Yes."
3604,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 7,"Was the instructor reasonably available and responsive to your needs during office hours and appointments, or on line?--- Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes. :: Yes! He always responded to emails within a few hours. He also had an app that would let us schedule appointments with him which was very easy. :: Yes. :: Yes, he was. :: Yes!. :: Yes, he answered questions by email in a timely fashion."
3605,Joseph Slater,2016 Fall,ME 7120,Question 8,"Do you have any additional, relevant comments?.--- Too many jokes. :: Would definitely have learned more effectively if more examples were worked out in class. It was sometimes difficult to see how a concept was actually applied and therefore hard to duplicate on projects and exams. :: His exam questions are not expected and the student ps don't know what to read in order to pass his tests. His questions are tricky and he chooses the questions based on what we missed during his speech in the class. :: One of the best professors I've ever had! I really enjoyed taking his class this semester!. :: Not much. :: One of the great professors i have studied under. :: I believe Dr. Slater is a good professor who demonstrated a deep understanding of this course's material. He was entertaining and witty, but this sometimes showed itself negatively in condescending and offensive comments. Some students can handle these comments well, but others could be discouraged from speaking up in class."
