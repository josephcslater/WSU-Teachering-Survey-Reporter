10,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 11,"Very well run class despite a terrible book. Dr. Jackson provided many examples to thoroughly explain the topic. He also provided real world situations and examples which many professors do not..| Pretty bad professor. Didn't make attendance mandatory and the classes were a joke so only 10 students including myself consistently showed up to class. His labs were a joke. I didn't learn a single thing from the labs. Went over examples in class but would just show the book solution to the problem and wouldn't actually work the problem out. Also would make tons of mistakes in his work and would get lost all of the time. Couldn't read his handwriting. Bad professor and am disappointed that he is teaching senior lab. The material for this class is also dumb, most engineering jobs will never use this..| He was often very unclear while explaining the subject matter, to the point of further confusing the class.| yes.| Teaching aspect overall is fine..| The instructor is very respectful and his level of understanding students' cases is highly appreciated, however this subject needs to reconsidred to have better and more useful matrials to get real benefits from it..| Dr. Jackson has an odd at times, but very hands on approach to teaching. He always answered questions in class to the best of his ability, and made problems as clear as possible so everyone would be able to understand what he was explaining..| i like his way by practicing the problems in the class..| asdf",2016 Summer
11,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 12,"Yes, through examples given in class, homework, lab problems, and test preparation..| not really.| no.| Typical instructor aids: readings and problems..| Actually not at all because this subject has many matrials are not useful. It should be more consantratied on only important materials..| Yes, he did. I went into this class with nearly no real knowledge of what it was going to be about, and through the lab and lecture sessions I have learned a great deal of things that before I probably wouldn't have either noticed or accounted for..| asdf",2016 Summer
12,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 13,yes.| The course content seemed to be random in flow and building over the course but overall ok..| This class should not a required class for Mechanical Engineering..| `asdf,2016 Summer
13,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 14,"Wonderful teacher, enjoyed his approach to problems and his life experiences in the engineering world he shared with the class.

24,ME 4140,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"very unclear on the project.| Dr. Bae is very kind and very intelligent, but I personally had a lot of difficulties with this class.  The biggest issue for me was that the problems that we went over in class were often left untested, and the test questions were barely explained in class.  While I understand that the questions on an exam have to be somewhat different than what has been covered in class, so that they are not too easy, but we would often spend a lot of time on a few subjects in class, only to never see them again on the exam.  The third quiz in particular was difficult for most people because we did very few problems like the ones on the quiz in class.  Most of the examples were over beam bending, and then the quiz was almost entirely over springs.  It's difficult for me to know how to do something if I haven't been shown a general example on how to do it.  Otherwise, I felt that I had a good understanding of the things that were covered in class..| yes, but grading was not totally fair sine the TA was grading our midterms, where the TA knows some students in the class as friends and gave them a score more than they deserve..| Good.| Bae is one of the worst instructors Wright State has. Does not care about the students at all. After every exam he would tell students who got below a 50 on it to simply drop the class. Other good professors would care more about their students and say stuff like come see me in office hours or work a little harder on homework or studying, not Bae. He just simply says if you got below a 50 I'd drop the class. Also his exams were nothing at all like the material we covered in class. For example our third exam consisted of two spring problems and we didn't cover a single spring problem throughout the course of the semester. Everyone did terrible on the exam and it was like he was surprised that everyone did bad. Terrible professor I would never take him again. Also if he didn't have his notes in front of him during lectures he wouldn't know the material worth a shit. His notes are the only reason he can even solve problems. For example his TA taught the class one day using his notes and did just as good of a job as Bae did. Anyone who could read could teach his class..| good.| he some how explain, but he gives us an easy example in class but in the quiz's he gave us really hard problem to solve..| Very clear in explaining and examples were really helpful..| His accent didnt stop him from making sure everyone understand this class.  Simply the best professor I had so far..| He is very kind but tough to understand sometimes. he goes way too fast on lectures and don't give time to understand well..| Very clear in his explanations. Overall an excellent teacher. Sometimes though, you barely hear what he says, because of his accemt. However, overtime, you get use to it..| He went through things way too quickly. It may have been because it was a summer semester but he still flew through chapters as if we should've already known the material he was teaching and all of it was just a review..| asdf.| I feel the teacher did a good job answering questions that were irregular..| Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae is one of the best professor ever. I learnt this subject very interestingly. And He explain us all theory with an examples step by step. He convert all difficult subject theory into easy and interesting subject.",2016 Summer
25,ME 4140,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"homework did not go with what he was teaching.| Dr. Bae did very well trying to understand and answer students' questions appropriately and accurately..| yes..| Good.| good.| no he did no. he did not give us the question problem during the class time. we asked him. he told us just to search on them in book..| Yes. Explains everything in details which let us learn more..| Mech design is not an easy class, with this teacher it was easy enough to break any problem down to a simple stuff so we can solve it..| yes.| Of course, Dr. Bae is very helpful instructor and the good thing in his class he try to join the class with reality through explain the topic and its application in life. also many time he refers to advantage and disadvantage of some topics depend on his experience.  i really enjoyed in his class and hope to take more classes with him..| Made himself available during his office hours to properly explain materials that were not understood during the lecture..| At times. Sometimes he would answer questions very well but other times he would stand there and look at the students as if they asked the dumbest questions..| asd.| Yes, I was interested in contact forces and he gave me food for thought when I asked during class..| Yes, Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae teach us Mechanical Design-1 very well. And the method as he teach us by point to point is like by every student of class.",2016 Summer
26,ME 4140,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,"needs to post homework with a week notes.| One major issue that I took with this course was that the homework was often assigned on either a Wednesday, to be due on a Monday, or a Saturday, to be due Wednesday.  This was very difficult to schedule with other classes and work.  It always took a lot of time to do the homework because the questions assigned were not very similar to the in-class examples, so that meant that there was not much time available to do an assignment that was very difficult.  This ended up taking time away from studying for the quizzes, and actually made the course more difficult.  We need more time for the homework assignments and they need to be questions that practiced what we went over in class..| Great.| good.| He did not give us any extra work. He told us he can not. HOW!! he is a professor of this course and all of the professors does.!!!!.| dd.| No further comment.| asdf.| All in all this was a great class! A lot of material for the summer..| I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae for teach us very difficult subject with his excellent Technic and convert it into easy and interesting subject. In future, If I have a change to get any subject related to my field, I will not hesitated and I am sure, I will take that definitely.  Thank You Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae",2016 Summer
27,ME 4140,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"give are tests back stop worrying about crap  His tests are out of control they nothing like what he teaches!!!!!!!!.| Bad teacher, the whole class struggled throughout the semester. What he taught in class was clear enough to understand/follow along, but the exams were no where near what he taught in class..| I think that Dr. Bae will be a very good teacher for this course, once he has it a little more organized..| none.| Thank you.| good.| ...| Very good professor. Would take any of his classes again, and would highly recommend anyone to take him..| asdf.| I will definitely suggest to take classes under him.  Thank You Very much Prof. Dr. Ha-Rok Bae.",2016 Summer

38,ME 3350,Zifeng Yang,Question 11,"the instructor is very good at what he is doing. he was clair all the time and his notes were very helpful..| Instructor gives good examples and answers all questions..| He was well organized.| Explained everything in depth to the point that we all could understand it.| good teacher.| Felt rushed in the end. We were going really fast and more examples would've helped me understand better..| Went over the theory first, then went on to solve multiple examples which was ideal..| Very good examples in class.| The professor was very clear and respectful of everyone.| Zifeng is a great professor, I had him for thermo and was very glad to see him as my instructor for fluids. I like the way he presents notes in class and works through examples. His exams are very fair also..| the instructor explains the material really well. he was clear and confidant about the material..| Good.| Went over a lot of examples in class and had good course notes and everything. I thought he did a good job teaching for the most part. I was upset though with the final exam schedule. I had three final exams in one day and his exam overlapped with both of the other exams due to the fact that he extended his exam period by 20 minutes. I asked him a week in advance if I could take the final exam a day early so that my exams wouldn't overlap and so I wouldn't have three finals in one day. He said the only choice I had was to take it 2 days early which was before he even covered all of the material that was going to be on the exam as well as going over the final review. The reason he gave was that if I took it two days early it would be less work for him. This in my opinion is bull crap because the final was worth 50% and I had to take it on a day that two other exams fell on and I had to leave the other exam periods early or show up late to accommodate for his final..| Good.| great teacher.| Very well..| The professor was clear in his explanations and had the students understanding as a priority.  He was understanding and willing to work with my inability to attend the first three classes, and it all worked out well..| He covered relevant examples and the same information that was in the book so I could go back and find the same info he covered.| he is a good instructor's for this specific class.| Very clear in explaining a difficult subject. His ability to take problems through a step by step process to give us time to understand was a big help..| instructor did examples and explained the theory behind most of the subject.  very good instructor..| Bad.| Clear and knowledgeable. I feel like to much time was spent on going through the derivations of the higher level concepts, while this is beneficial in a graduate course I'm sure, at the undergraduate level I think example problems are more helpful than derivations..| He explained concepts with examples and notes.",2016 Summer
39,ME 3350,Zifeng Yang,Question 12,"yes very much, specially with the class problem and examples..| Yws, his examples were very clear..| yes.| yes by explains the concept of the subject.| Yes. when given a question he would explain it in further detail if it was needed. examples in class helped a lot for hw assignments.| yes, would ask interesting questions to get you thinking about what he was teaching about.| yes, explains things very well.| Yes..| Yes very clear explanations.| Yes.| yes.| Good.| Yes.| He is one of the best teachers in the Mechanical Engineering department..| great teacher.| Yes..| He did a good job at explaining the content and the examples we went through.  The examples were well explained and were golden study material.  He gave a good study guide in class too, which was incredibly useful and helped encourage students to class..| Yes his examples were good.| yes, he does. any question you need he give you even an explain to make sure you understand the question..| I feel lucky to have taken it with Zifeng..| yes, very good examples inside of class, good review for exams..| Yes.| Yes, he was always able to answer any questions..| Yes. He was able to explain different concepts.",2016 Summer
40,ME 3350,Zifeng Yang,Question 13,"Proff Zifeng is one of the best ME instructors.| Very good teacher. If I could change one thing it would be the weight of the exams. Not being a good test taker, and having the final exam being worth half my grade makes for a stressful combination.| No.| Thanks.| Also this class is a joke because no one will ever use this material again in their lives. The only person who will use this material is someone going for their PhD in fluids mechanics..| great teacher.| Thank you..| The class was good.

52,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 11,"to further help us understand the course material, he would do in class example problems similar to our homework problems..| The professor was respectful and supplied a better teaching style towards the end of the semester. Going through examples in class helped a lot towards the end of the semester. However, teaching concepts through examples on a slide show I did not find helpful. During the class, the professor would click through the slides too fast and cause students to not have enough time to understand concepts. Having more explanation of problem processes would have been helpful too..| kind of clear.| Class time seemed very rushed..| Difficult to understand at times, seemed to jump around alot and leave examples unfinished, confused students who were trying to understand how to be able to replicate the methods in homework and testing..| Instructor didn't give time to work problems out or takes notes. Example problems were already worked out so it was hard to follow along. Shouldn't read straight from powerpoint..| Great teacher, made topics very easy to understand, wish he could teach my upper level engineering classes.| He is a good professor who knows the material very well. He is a little nervous when he lectures so it is hard to understand or hear him at some points, but other than that I enjoyed his class..| Nikolai was not very responsive with questions during class time, even when he asked if there were any questions. Every one of the lectures was powerpoint that was read word for word from the slides. The examples gone over in class were always entry level material into the topic, never helping with the difficult questions that would appear on homework and exams..| There were a lot of days that it was very hard to understand the material and whenever we work through problems in class, he speeds through them and it is hard to follow..| He is clear for the most part. I think he tries really hard to try and get us to understand the material but I think he has a hard time teaching it to the students. I think he handles questions pretty well for the most part and respects the individuals..| Examples problems were walked through during almost every lecture. A few more minutes could have been used for the ""quizzes"" during lecture..| excellent professor would take again takes things slow and makes sure you understand them. The class is well defined and there is no excuse for anything. Well Done!.| K.| He was overall a decent professor.  He could provide better explanation on the different topics that we learn. Also, provide better office hours that work with the students schedules..| Teaching dynamics off of pre-made PowerPoint slides made this class unbearable. Problems were almost never worked out on the board and could not really understand him very well. Tests were easy enough to do well, but the material was not taught well at all..| clear explanation and handling question very good..| He provided lots of examples, but some of the PowerPoint examples he went through too quickly to follow..| Examples were very clear but were often much simpler than the homework..| The examples were helpful, but I feel like some of the conceptual ones didn't help very much. More basic, specific problems would have been more useful.| Did more lecturing than practical learning with doing problems, a lot of variable work problems that skipped many steps and were easy to get lost in..| He was okay but he could've been better. I do not think PowerPoint presentations are the most effective way of teaching Dynamics, and that's what a lot of this course consisted of. He definitely knew what he was talking about but sometimes he did not know how to explain it very effectively..| I think you're a very knowledgeable professor but the setup of the class and the lectures were not effective and not enough time was spent doing problems and understanding the material. Too much time was spent on the theoretical background and setup of equations or problems. I'm not the only one but most of the kids learn best when we see problems worked out and if equations are used that we don't understand or a concept we haven't seen before we're more inclined to ask questions about it..| I felt like the majority of the time he would ramble about stuff that was not important or did not pertain to the class. It was very hard to stay awake and keep focused in that class. He answered questions to the best of his ability being able to answer any question asked..| Teacher provided good examples in class. Sometimes the theory and process behind the examples were unclear..| Very clear explanations, but required participation and critical thinking.| Nikolai is very knowledgeable and help my understanding greatly..| Excellent examples, always wanted students to learn..| Gave clear understanding examples for each problem and thoroughly explained them..| He was good in lecture.",2017 Spring
53,ME 2210,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 12,"yes, in class example problems, quiz questions, and power point notes were used to help us understand the course material..| The instructor supplied a basis of understanding of this subject. However, when it came to exams, I found myself teaching myself the processes. If more explanation was given in how the problems were carried out, I feel that the class would have helped with my understanding more. The classes felt rushed though and he seemed to skip over explanations..| yes.| Yes. Brought in mechanisms for inperson examples, applied material to real life examples, and was helpful during office hours..| No, what I gained from this class I mostly taught myself, because in class examples were not from relevant course materials, and could not be validated or the answers checked. most frustrating.| Not much if any.| he had very informative power points and explains them very well.| brought models in to display certain topics.| Up until this point I have done well in the class, but my understanding in the subject has been entirely based on myself reading through the book and working through the examples. This is how you must learn most of the material in most classes, but it is nice when a professor seems excited about the subject and is willing to help clarify difficult material, which Nikolai is not..| Very little. All of the power points he had were not made by him and occasionally he wouldn't know what it was trying to do. He also would already have problems worked out that he would go over in class and instead of walking through a problem he would just copy what he already did. Whenever he would ask if there are questions, he rarely looked up to see if anyone actually had their hand raised. Which about 75% of the time there was..| He tried to. He brought items in like K'NEX to demonstrate the things we were learning..| Yes. With some of the examples, the instructor would being in hands-on gears and pulleys to help visualize what we were analyzing in class..| K.| No, not really. Majority of the topics I learned I taught myself from the book, or depended on friends..| No, Math cannot be taught from pre-made PowerPoint slides. Examples should be done on the board..| yes, he aid my understanding of this subject.| Yes, he was available to answer questions when I had them..| Yes, he was willing to explain problems to make sure we understood them..| The general course structure and examples in class helped.| yes.| He did help a little. He provided us with some examples, but the examples that he went over in class were much easier than the homework problems. Therefore, I had to teach myself a lot of the more complicated material..| Yes, the concept questions and quizzes helped a lot..| Not really, I had to teach myself everything throughout the semester.| Yes.  Examples. Review Exams. Review of lectures..| Yes, provided multiple examples to aid in understanding the material.| He was very helpful when i had quesions..| Yes. Gave good examples.

80,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Examples provided were not applicable to either exams or real-life. Spent way too much time on theoretical happenings and did not touch on actual engineering examples..| Dr. Sucosky was up front about the difficulty of the class. However, he explained the materials well and quickly responded to any questions that students had. He gave plenty of examples and was clear on what was expected out of students..| Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor and one of the most intelligent people I have had the privilege to listen to. Does a great job at giving notes and material to the class that really contributes to the class learning..| Materials supplied via the website where very helpful..| His in class examples and explanations were clear. The homework however is greatly outside the realm of possibilities for students to be able to complete..| I liked how he gave handouts with notes on them, so that we can fill in the blanks; it was easier to follow along and write the notes, while still paying attention to what he was saying. Class time was spent wisely. He taught the course very well, considering it is a hard subject..| Some people have stated they feel as if he comes of a bit arrogant. I can not say I do not see what they are saying but I do not believe that it is intentional..| Very helpful professor. One of the best I've had so far at Wright State. Homework and notes were clearly laid out. Willing to answer any questions and helpful during office hours as well..| I did not like the way the homework was set up. I felt like my homework had to be perfect or my grade would suffer dramatically..| Philippe gave handouts as examples, which really helped the learning of the material. The handouts further helped explain the information, and the tests were based off them. He respected everyone equally..| He is a very good instructor, easy to understand, and explains the material well..| Thank you.| Lectures were put together excellently. This is a very difficult course but the material provided made everything much easier. Being able to use resources such as our notes, handouts, and practice exams on the exams makes it easier to understand and show my obtained knowledge..| Very clear in explanations of coursework. Class was very well organized and seldom strayed off topic. He engaged the class well with guided notes and interactive simulations. He was very straightforward to the class about student expectations, responsibilities, and potential outcomes. Every piece of information that was necessary to excel on the tests and homework was provided to students in class or on his course website. He is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable of the subject and did his best to appeal to the level of knowledge of the students when answering questions and explaining difficult concepts. There were no surprises throughout the class because of how well it was organized and I feel that as a whole, students would be much more successful if all classes were structured like Sucosky's. I definitely learned a lot about the fundamentals of fluid mechanics throughout the semester..| Dr. Sucosky is among the top 5% of the best professors I have had the pleasure of learning from. He is highly organized in his presintation of information and able to answer complex questions with understandable answers. Thank you for the time spent with us..| the instructor has a strict system that works on making the students learning the material..| Dr. Sucosky was excellent in covering new topics and going over examples..| Overall handled questions well..| Not good, class time just keep  writing and reading it's not writing class.| The problem I had was that he gave homework that he said not to study for the exam because they wouldn't be similar enough, but my study consists of doing homework. I don't have time to do homework that will be useless, then also study what is expected..| I appreciate his approach to the material..| Very organized professor, everything is very clear. If you have any questions, go up to his office hours and he will gladly help you. His tests are exactly what he says they will be and his review sessions are extremely helpful.",2017 Spring
81,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 12,"Instructor did a poor job of conveying useful information. Expectations of students were unclear in expectations for exams. Did not explain how any of the information we learned was applicable to any real-life scenarios..| Yes, he did. Made sure he went through every step in his example problems and note taking to make sure the students had clear idea on what to do, even with the extremely difficult material that is studied in fluid dynamics..| Again, he was a clear teacher. But homework is impossible to complete..| Yes, he gave real-world examples of things we were learning about. For example, one day he showed us how the velocity of air flows through an f1-formula car. I thought that was very interesting and it greatly sparked my interest in the subject..| He focused far too much on thorough and far to little on application. more example work and less how we get there would be extremely helpful..| Yes. Homework and notes were extremely helpful and could be used on tests. Practice exams were given for each exam as well as a review session was held. Very helpful overall.| He provided very helpful handouts..| He did help aid in my understanding. Sometimes the information being wrote out was a little much, but overall the notes were helpful..| Yes.| Yes, awesome.| As I said above, the class was well structured and all material necessary for learning the topic was provided in the class and on his website. The book was mainly used for reinforcement and more in depth ""next level"" learning development. The instructor most definitely aided in my understanding of the subject because the students expectations and outcomes were clearly outlined in his class syllabus and everyday lecture. There were no surprises and I think many professors could learn a thing or two about how to structure a class from Sucosky. Intelligent, straightforward, and honest..| yes, he made sure I learned all the material by taking notes and using handouts..| Any questions I had, Dr. Sucosky was able to answer..| Yes. Answered all my questions in class..| No.| I think he could have spent more time on examples. We spent days on proving the equation, then twenty minutes on an example of how to use it. When it came to the exam, the example was there, but in situations I hadn't seen or anticipated because I didn't know to anticipate them. After the first exam, we got examples of what to expect, the only problem was only one out of every three was something I had seen and could figure out how to solve properly..| He did, as everything was extremely clear and organized..| He did go over handouts and notes, but he did not give very many concrete examples. It was hard with the homework being so different from the things that were done in class to learn the material. Test questions were different than the homework and were very challenging.",2017 Spring
82,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 13,"Below average instructor..| Professor Sucosky is a fantastic professor. I have no complaints about him, as he is a smart and intelligent man with a gift in teaching. My only issue was he did not respond to an email about one of my finals (potential grading issue), but it wasn't a huge deal..| Lower the difficulty of the homework..| Overall, he is a great professor. Taught the class very well and his exams were fair..| I was extremely interested in this class it was in fact probably the class I wanted to take most out of all required classes in my degree. But this class has become nothing more than a chore. We learned so little about how to actually solve for dynamic fluid problems and so much on base theories most of which we will not utilize..| Thanks.| Awesome style of teaching.| No additional comments..| Nothing.| He was available for consultation yes, and he said people who came to his office often passed with higher grades. I would have liked it if he spent more time teaching what he expected us to know. I work, so I can't go to office hours all the time, I go to class to learn what I need to know.... only that it feels like he teaches everything EXCEPT what we are expected to know..| He is a very cool professor who clearly knows what he is talking about.

83,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 14,"Looked down on students. Assumed that if you didn't understand material immediately, you never would understand it..| Dr. Sucosky is a great professor. The material in this course is naturally difficult, but if one does as Dr. Sucosky instructs the course becomes a lot more manageable..| Thank you for a great semester!.| Lower the difficulty of the homework..| One thing that I did not like was how he gave much harder problems on the homeworks than he did on the exams. I would have liked it better if he gave the same amount of difficulty on the homeworks as the exams. Alot of the homeworks i had a very hard time trying to solve them. If the homework was easier, it would have given us more practice problems similar to what is on the exams..| It is very helpful that the homework is worth 25% of the grade but It is so difficult compared the book/exam problems. If the homework represented problems that we would more likely see on an exam it would have been more beneficial..| Great teaching.| He is a great teacher and very strict..| No comment s.| Nothing.| Awesome professor who makes a challenging class a little bit easier to grasp.",2017 Spring

Writing on the board can sometimes be a tad small and hard to read..| Very good.| Hard to follow along with what he is explaining sometimes, not real clear in explanations..| Sometimes seemed to get confused when someone asked a question or clarification but he did very well in explaining when he understood what was being asked..| Would like more working out of problems in class and less theory explanation.| Dr. Bae did a very good job teaching this material.  I always enjoy his classes.  He does a lot of examples and really takes the time to help us learn the material..| Very good examples and explanations to in class problems that helped me understand the material..| Dr. Bae knows and taught the subject of Vibration of Mechanics very well.  Consequently, Dr. Bae instructing ethics has not been ""up to par"" (fair); to illustrate this,  Dr. Bae has penalized students for grievances he wasn't clear on (he never declared he would penalize), however, he did not penalize students for grievances he was clear on (he did say he would penalize on syllabus).  This type of teaching (inconsistencies) makes it unfair for all students that are under his instructing.  I think Dr. Bae has the potential of becoming a great teacher, but his bad ethical practices is one great hindrance to him and this great institution: I have had other master level students complain about his bad ethics.  This is constructive criticism and nothing personal.  As a matter of fact there has been time when Dr. Bae has shown good ethics with his students; consequently, this is very rare occurrence with Dr. Bae: hence he has potential of becoming a great professor. Thanks GAA.| He could write a little bigger on the board. Depending on where you sit, it is difficult to see what is written..| Teaching was fairly well done. Sometimes had trouble figuring out what was being taught in class, and how it was different from previously learned material.| Lots of examples which were helpful.| I believe that Dr. Bae showed us many examples of everything that he expected of us. He was clear and precise on everything..| I felt like matlab was useless in this class. It is required to be able to do it on the homework which is useful but then can not be used on the exam..| The written notes on Pilot were helpful when reviewing and doing homework.  Numerous examples were covered in class for each topic.  The matlab code is helpful and helps students understand the solving procedure..| Examples were good and the instruction sound.  However the presentation was difficult.  PDF notes were projected onto the white board - not a screen, so there was a glare.  Half of the lights were on, so the dim lighting made the projection harder to read and the white-board handwriting difficult to read.  All handwriting was difficult to read.  The PDF notes were too small to read from the middle of the room. Office hours were good though, and the professor was patient in his explanations..| Lectures were useful. Definitely helped for exams. Exams had questions that were prepared so that they tested knowledge of the subject without any major tricks..| While there is a small difficulty understanding some words from time to time, Dr. Bae is very good about making sure that the students understand the material and the content he is trying to relay. The examples always help in understanding the theory and formulas. He is very open to questions, and does a very good job answering them satisfactorily. He does a great job with providing conceptual examples to understand the problems..| he is one of the best in ME.| Examples are good, but instructor is sometimes hard to understand..| Explained topics well despite his accent and treated students well..| The examples in class made it clear on how to use the principles being taught, and what each variable was explained in depth. The class can clearly be a difficult class to teach, and Dr. Bae did a great job.  The only negative opinion I have of the class was trying to keep notes. As I was writing notes I had a hard time keeping up with the notes he would write in class and the notes that were projected on the board. It made it difficult to keep up with the writing and pay attention to the lesson..| I felt that to much of the class this semester revolved around reading straight from the notes on the projector. I've had Dr. Bae Previously and he was an excellent professor. Felt as though he wasn't as confident on this material..| Dr. Ha-Rok Bae was always good at answer questions of students in a clear and straight forward manner. Unless the answer was about to come up in the next portion of the lecture, then he would have the student wait to see if the question was answered after the lecture covered the material..| Most classes were spent doing examples which really helps in the understanding of the material. Most professors only focus on content with no examples making the class difficult to understand. This is not one of those classes.| Dr. Bae is one of the better professor's at the university. Funny guy bringing some levity to the dry material..| Needs to spend more time on examples and not just going over the notes that are given. Just make students read before class and then do problems..| Gives good examples. I have enjoyed the chapter 4 lectures, but I thought CH 1-3 were boring. That's more of an issue with content than teaching style though..| Dr. Bae is one of my favorite professors at WSU, everything was fine..| Very Clear. My third time taking him in a class, and I Love his classes..| The professor's teaching is good. The explanation and examples are not up to the standard of exam conducted.| From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding. He answers each and every questions or doubts..| From the aspect of teaching, Dr. Bae explains theory very well and also gives examples for better understanding.

137,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"Yes reviewing multiple examples helped.| Yes, I saw him in his office for help on the homework and he helped me to make sense of the material..| Dr. Bae aided in my understanding by answering my questions through email and after class..| The instructor did aid in my understanding of the subject through the examples he did in class. Homework that was assigned was also a good way to learn the various subjects we were talking about..| Yes he did.| Not at all, almost everything I learnt during the class was self taught. Dr. Bae has a teaching style that is hard to follow and at most times doesn't make sense..| In some regards yes, it was sometimes hard to figure out what exactly we were solving for in a problem or what certain variables meant..| Very much so.| Dr. Bae does a great job of taking the time to explain the material to us.  The only criticism I would give is that the notes could be hard to follow in class and I wasn't always sure what material was important to record, and what material should not be recorded.  The class was very fast paced, so this made it difficult to follow as Dr. Bae would switch between the notes and examples and it could get confusing..| Yes Dr Bae gave real world examples that I could relate to which made the material easier..| Dr. Bae has the potential of aiding, but he tends to discourage students from asking questions; to illustrate, he compares other students ability to figure out a problem quicker than that student that couldn't (office hours): which can disable a student from asking for aid from Dr. Bae.  Besides that, he taught the subject very well..| Yes. He would stay after class to help answer some question we had or would ask us to come to his office hours..| Yes, was able to visually show how an object would move by using Matlab. Which also helped to see how changing the parameters affected the system..| Yes, I learned alot.| Yes, Dr, Bae was much more clear than the book for this course and made sure that we understood everything before moving on..| Dr. Bae simplified each solving method into a list of simple steps to break down problems. He also went through matlab code to show how these steps are used and how they work together..| Yes. He answered conceptual questions to the best of his ability..| Yes, Dr. Bae was always very open to questions and helpful in answering them in or out of class..| yes does a great job.| I asked for clarification on a topic and he cleared up the confusion..| Dr. Bae did a great job explaining, answering questions, and knowing when the class was overwhelmingly confused. He would stop periodically to ask the class if there were questions and would take time to make sure the questions were answered..| Yes, some examples were helpful.| Yes, I had a question about mode shape responses and he was able to meet with me directly after class to clear up my confusion..| Yes. As stated above the examples really help to build an understanding of the material and how to apply it..| Yes, he likes to use colorful MATLAB plots to demonstrate a vibration analysis. Again, helps create more interest in the subject..| Yes. good professor.  Good person..| Yes, he gives good lectures and the homeworks were extensive..| yes.| Yes he did. He provided numerous examples, and stimulated thinking.| Yes, Professor helps in getting the clarity of the subject and specific topics. Dr. Bae clarified my doubt related objects response to resonance conditions and the possibility to create virtual machine which can convert excess resonance energy to useful form..| Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of this subject. Dr. Bae used to give real life applications of the theory and he even showed the examples in matlab to broaden our concepts in mechanical vibration..| Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of this subject.

138,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,"I thought the class was taught well..| No further comment.| Poor teaching style..| Dr. Bae did a great job when showing how to solve the ""Vibration of Mechanics"" problems using Mat Lab: according to what I have learn previously in Mat Lab..| While being able to view the PDF on pilot greatly helped, I had trouble following some of the material when the PDF was used in class..| Dr. Bae is an excellent professor..| nope.| N/a.| It would seem that the lab and the lecture are not even related. The labs are months ahead in the material and really only provide as an exercise in MATLAB than anything to do with vibration analysis. Painful 4 weeks..| No..| The homeworks were often very long and time consuming, I think it could serve for those to be cut down and targeted closer to the types of problems on exams. 5-6 problems per homework would have been better than 10-12 problems.| One of the best engineering professors here at Wright State.| Everything was good except the time given to solve problems.

139,ME 4210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"I thought this class wasn't too bad.  I know it's the hardest in the major and I thought the intuition a gained from this class will be useful.  The ability to research more on my own and do a deeper analysis if I am required isn't out of the question either.  Thanks Dr. Bae.| I would suggest providing some solutions to the homework assignments before the homework is due. This helps in learning if the students get stuck so they can see how the problem is properly solved rather than doing it wrong the first time and thinking it is right..| Overall the class was taught fairly well. The examples were good and the homework helped aid in the understanding of these examples. The labs were alright but they it was hard sometime to understand and follow along with what the lab was looking for..| None.| When student's would find mistakes in the notes he posted online in Pilot, he didn't make note of the changes so he could correct the notes at a later date. It's unknown if he ever went back and re-uploaded corrected notes. Anyone who missed that class or stepped out of the room for those few minutes when the correction was brought up would never know, and could possibly have now incorrect formulas or methods on crib sheets or homework.| Dr. Bae did a great job and I enjoy his classes!.| All the info I have provided has been only the truth and nothing personal (not trying get anyone in trouble); I would hope this will generate a healthy dialogue for Dr. Bae..| MATLAB codes were useful, but they weren't allowed on exams. Because of this, some of the homework wasn't very useful for studying for exams..| the crib sheets i want to keep so do not write on them.| N/a.| adsf.| I could tell that Dr. Bae liked FEA more than vibrations. We had so much fun in FEA..| Great class, I enjoyed it.  Thanks!.| Dr.Bae is so helpful for graduate students. He is a knowledgeable person.

Most of the information in the lab manual was not well explained or collected in a readable manner..| Lab time was spent horribly, most of the labs we stood for the whole class period and never had to do a thing. Then we would collect data that the TA did for us and leave without any explanation on how to use the matlab functions that were required to get your results..| Labs were long but related to class so that helped make them easier.| The labs were often repetitive and given with such instruction that put the focus on understanding matlab and not about understanding what was going on..| Labs were taken from when Dr. Slater took it, so the TA wasn't always familiar with the material. He was helpful with what he did know, but many things he did not know..| Class was actually handled by a TA.  Explanations of labs were straightforward, demonstrations helpful..| Explained topics well, answered questions with clarity, and treated student very respectfully..| Sazzad did the best that he could with what he had to work with. Labs were silly as students barely use the software and basically show up to strike a beam or wing with an impulse measurement hammer. Labs were was ahead of the material and so I had little to no clue as to what I was doing.",2017 Spring

Not always because the data was flawed, although it was occasionally, but mostly because the lab did not teach us how to appropriately analyze the data and the lab was way ahead of the material that we learned in class.  So it made it absurd and not very useful..| The lab was a little less well put together in my opinion. I still learned from it, and it was nice to see the content from the class actually put into practice, but I learned more from the class itself..| Dr. Bae is good the TA of the lab though is a complete moron.

234,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"Clarity of explanations - The instructor repeats the explanation that is provided in the recommended textbook. I don't understand the point of coming to the class if I have to read and hear the same lines. Examples - Same as above. The instructor didn't take efforts to solve examples outside of the textbook. More emphasis was given on completion of the course syllabus rather than the student's understanding..| Personally, I would prefer that less lecture time is spent on the derivations of various equations. Although derivations are helpful for understanding the assumptions involved in various methods, examples of how the equations are used are much more effective at helping to cement the method in my mind. I'm not saying to focus exclusively on examples. It would just be nice to shift the balance a bit. I would also have appreciated it if Dr. Bae used some examples which didn't come directly from the text. That way, more than one example would be available to help clarify the use of the different methods. Finally, it would be more manageable if the homework assignments were split into smaller assignments due more frequently..| The professor needs to do more examples that aren't straight from the book. After seeing only one example, it was very difficult to do the homework and do well on the tests..| Good.| Because the book is not easy to read and understand, for me the examples are important to understand the class. But the example is not enough, it makes me hard to catch up the class. Handout material also could not help me a lot.  But this is the first time Dr. Bae teach this course, so it is could be understood for his difficulty..| excellent method for teaching and also answer all of the students questions during the class..| Everything was well organised..| Instructor was clear with his teaching and examples . Answered the question to the point with valid explanation. Instructor respect the individual and allow student to speak and ask question during lecture hours..| -Instructor provided good explanation of all topics of this course along with many examples. He also used to asks question during class that allows us to think on that topic. He also used to respect each individuals. He used to clear the doubts of each individual till that students get clear understanding..| Dr. Bae is an overall good professor and this course went as well as it probably could have being his first time teaching it.  One improvement that could be made adding more examples (beyond what is included in the textbook) and having a solution to the homework available before the homework is assigned so he can more easily help students on homework if they have trouble.  One minor thing, when doing equations on the board, please write your ""w"" and ""omega"" symbols differently.  It was difficult to tell sometimes when he was talking about displacement (w) or natural frequency (omega).  Also, always be sure to use different symbols for different quantities, for example towards the beginning of the class there was a mix up between ""H"" for the hamiltonian and the ""H"" matrix. I would also like to see more numerical methods taught in this course rather than just the theory since this is ""computational"" methods for structural dynamics.  Other than those minor things, job well done for the first time teaching the course..| 1) During my Graduation, Dr. Bae is one of best professor and always very helpful. 2) He explaining example very well during the class so that we can easily solve the homework problem even in exam problem too. 3) Dr. Bae is awesome. He explain everything very well and I learned a lot from him. If I get a chance, I would like to be a future student under him. And suggest other student also to be a part of it. 4) He is very energetic during class and always positive. He is very respectful and cares about the whole class. 5) He gave us excellent knowledge about different kind of software like MATLAB, Mathematica..| The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students. I like the way he took personal care of the problems arose from the individual students..| Good",2017 Spring
235,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"Somewhat. He often seemed unprepared for class. Im sure he will get better when he gets more experience teaching the course..| Yes.| He really tried to make sure all students understand the class, but it is hard to know comprehend all knowledge in class..| yes definitely. at the starting off the class he took a per-requisite test for this subject. and he also provide all the materials for study. its really good that he took that test because we can have some basic of this subject clear..| Yes..| yes instructor was helpful in understanding this subject. Any doubt asked was cleared with an example which help in understanding the subject and also did relative examples in class to help understanding the structure..| -Yes instructor aided in understanding this subject well. He used to clear my doubts during class time or even after class in office hours. He used to give different examples so that I can understand the topic well..| Yes.| As I said earlier that I like the way he teaching the subject by explaining everything very well.  And understanding of example during the class helps in exam and homework problem. I was challenged in this course but Dr. Bae made easy to understand this subject..| Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept..| Yes, Classes have been interesting.",2017 Spring
236,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,"To be honest, I don't understand the point of appointing an instructor if all he does is re-write whatever is given in the textbook with no additional information. It would have saved the students a lot of money and time if they were directly told to read the textbook and appear for an exam..| Nothing else.| Please, please add more example to help students understand the knowledge. If possible, teach some knowledge about the software you used in class. If possible, change the book, it is not friendly to students (like me)..| No further comments. Instructor was fluent with his teaching and examples..| -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor..| This class is very important and has many application in my focused area in future or in job.  Great teaching in all subject that I had took under him. He has excellent knowledge about software..| Everything is good",2017 Spring
237,ME 7210,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"Examples - More examples from outside the recommended textbook will go a long way in helping the student's learning..| This is the first time to Dr. Bae teach this class? This is a really hard course, hope he can help more students to understand the techniques used in this class..| -Overall teaching was really good and I learnt this subject well under this instructor..| At the last, Dr. Bae is very very very good professor..| I would like to take the subjects in future under this instructor..| This is not regarding the Professor. Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly. This will benefit every one who is interest but kind of feel tough to grasp the teachings.",2017 Spring

She respected all individuals equally..| Dr. Gockel did a good job using examples, answering questions, and explaining the material effectively for the students to learn..| Dr. Gockel was a fantastic professor and  was very clear in every thing she expected from her students..| Sometimes explanations were vague and confusing, but she did well handling questions from the class and did her best to guide students to understand the topic more clearly. First year teaching the course and it was noticeable.| Very clear real world explanations..| The examples in class were very useful to reflect on while doing the homework. Since there are a TON of equations, it was nice to have some examples that used them. The homework was actually useful to do, unlike many of the other courses I have taken at Wright State. The exams were similar to the homework problems, which seems to be an oddity in the engineering classes. She handled any questions I had, and answered anyone's questions in class..| In class she was fine.  She provided both theory and real-world examples.  She would go a little too fast at times, and wouldn't thoroughly explain every step to every problem sometimes..| Provided great examples and taught them well..| clarity of explanations and examples.| Very clear instruction.

She encourages the class to ask questions, and gladly answers all of them. Her exams were clear and tested over the material covered..| The instructor did quite well with questions and worked out a lot of helpful examples..| Dr. Gockel comes to class prepared with both new material and effective examples every class period.

250,ME 3120,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"We were given 4 weeks instead of 8 to work on a semester project, which was complete nonsense and I completely object to. Assigning a major project with half the allotted time listed in the syllabus was a total foul..| Halfway through the class she gave us a break which I strongly believe helped keep us engaged during lecture. Knowing we had a 5-10 minute break also helped the class time go quicker and not drag..| Only issues I really had was taking too long of a break during the class. She usually would give a 5 minute break halfway through. I would rather just have pressed through and finished early. Also, she wrote slightly too small for certain parts of the room to see. Other than that, no problems..| Nice woman, good teacher. I'd take her again for other courses..| She could sometimes be a little vague, and I feel as though she was a little bit unorganized when it came to a comprehensive list of what we've learned.

While lecturing she breaks down the information into chunks that follow the syllabus to a point. When it comes to answering questions she is respectful of students, not simply saying ""no"", ""incorrect"" or ""not even close"" she tries to understand where the students question is coming from. Giving an opportunity to explain why the question was brought up initially, and how to solve for the students question. She not only teaches the subject at hand but as well as critical thinking skills..| Joy was easily one of the best professors I've had at wright state. She provided several examples throughout the class and made sure to allow time for students to ask questions. Everything in the class seemed fair and she treated everyone with respect during the duration of the course. I really wish I had the opportunity to have her as a professor again..| Overall, instructor was good. However exams were slightly ambiguous and more challenging than previous examples..| Dr. Gockel is a very good professor, she is very good with the subject and was quick to reply to  questions the students had..| She does a lot of examples and answers a lot of questions to further our understanding.  She also gives pop quizzes every once in a while to keep us sharp.  The final project is a great way for us to apply what we've learned..| Very clear. Told you what she wanted you to know. Exams were a little over the top though..| She was a very good teacher, always answered any questions right away clearly and always respected her class..| The instructor was average with regards to this..| Lectures were straight to the point and notes given were extremely helpful for homework as well as exams. Everything was explained in a clear and concise manner..| Dr. Gockel was very good at explaining things in a clear and concise manner. She also handled questions from the class well and also was able to inject a lot of real world information into the lectures..| She is easily the best instructor I had this semester when is comes to teaching the courses material. I learn more in her one week review of mechanics of materials course than I learned the in the whole previous Mechanic of materials course..| yes.| Spent class understanding equations needed to solve problems.| Clear examples, responded to questions clearly, concisely, and helpfully, and was always respectful..| Ava;iable during office hours, kind and was good at helping answer questions.| Professor Gockel always treated the class and the questions of the student with great respect and provided us with organized material that she tried to make as clear as possible..| Very good at explaining things and handling questions..| Very clear. Easy to understand. Willing to slow things down so people actually understand..| The teacher has a well made system in teaching this course. I enjoyed this class very much from the way she taught it. she used class time very well and did example problems to make sure the students know what they are doing..| No additional comments..| Her teachung style was very easy to listen to and understand. The examples she did were applicable and dine in an orderly and simple way.

263,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"For Mechanical Design, Professor Gockel was always open to new ideas and questions relative to better understanding lecture. For whatever questions that were asked she would lead you in the right direction but allow you to arrive at the conclusion. By doing this it makes learning the material easier and more effective..| Yes, Joy was available during and outside of office hours to provide extra help. I had needed to meet her one day and she was respectful and helpful in making sure we understood the topic before we left her office..| Instructor was very good at explaining concepts..| She's cool brah..| The material that she taught in the class was helpful for me to succeed in her class. she good helpful explanations..| Not overly.  Most of this class was self taught. Of the lecture time, we spent maybe 10% going over what we truly needed. The rest of the time was spent going through long mathematical proofs on how we derived the formulas for our calculations in the first place. The class should be about application.  If we want to know were our approaches come from, we should simply take the initiative to find that portion on our own. We are tested over our ability to apply these formulas to situations.  As such, our time should be spent learning how to apply, not how we obtained the approach in the first place. I can safely say little of class time was beneficial to learning how to do anything in the real world..| Very willing to answer any questions that arose in class. All homework was related to material that was just covered in class and was comparable to questions that were given all the exams. Had flexible office hours if students needed extra help..| Absolutely. The lectures were very organized and easy to follow even when the content was difficult..| yes.| Dr. Gockel provided lots of theory in class and spent time making sure the equations were explained in class.| Yes.

264,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"The tests are absolutely inexcusably too long. Never before have I been in a class where I was unable to finish a test due to simple time, rather than clarity of material. At no point did I stall or was I held up in any way on the test material, yet I was unable to finish in time. We had a 55 minute test, including time to hand out, and there were 11 parts, not counting the graduate problem.  Even if the tests were able to be instantaneously handed out, this is only 5 minutes per part. During our final class day Dr. Gockle actually stated ""it is my goal to create a test that 25% are done with 30 minutes remaining. By the end to have 50% to 75% to be finished"".  By stating this, it means she aims for 25%-50% of the class to be incapable of finishing her test in the allotted time. This is completely irreprehensible. Some have stated that is actually the school’s goal.  If this is true, and I hope it is not, it is still irreprehensible as we are paying costumers not people being done a favor. We pay to be educated on the material.  As such, the goal should be to help us learn the material.  And with learning as the main focus, on a fair test, anyone who did not  make truly poor decisions regarding learning the material should have no problem finishing the test and achieve an average grade, that being a C.  It seems as though her goal is to be certain that some of us fail, rather than learn.  And with an intentional lack of adequate time, she is not judging our knowledge at all, but rather how quickly we can guess..| Best ME professor in College of Engineering.| Often times, I felt we spent class time deriving/ learning too many equations but not solving problems. While I was in class, it made sense but trying problems on my own were often times difficult and I had little to no examples to reference.  Exams were setup to take the entire class period assuming no mistakes were made, they felt a little long.| No further comments.| Tests were unfair for the 55 minute time block. Material was fair just to much of it.| Professor Gockel seems like a very nice and respectful person that is very enthusiastic about her job. I have learned  a ton thanks to her teaching..| No additional comments..| Just that when I say she made it easy to learn that doesn't mean the material was necessarily easy.

At the beginning of class he explains the general principles and equations and next he demonstrates how to use those equations & principles to solve problems by applying them to several examples. His examples are chosen to show how these equations and principles can be used in different real world situations. He tries to make solving these examples an interact process by asking us what the next step might be. After all he is teaching problem solving.

I like leaving a class with a notebook FULL of relative information and examples. Dr. Li utilized the white board and made every effort to give us all of the course note. It motivated me to come to class because I wanted to learn more about the subject. Very linear pace as far as the project was concerned. If you took good notes, payed attention, and went to each class and consulted in office hours, it was a good project that is understandable..| Dr Li always gave examples related to real life applications and comparisons on how the theories of the subject were applied to the industry and what the industry expects from new graduates.| He is a very motivative teacher, never degrades his students. Explains things very patiently which is one of the most important things I like..| The instructor was very enthusiastic while teaching and handling the questions from the students.

Dr. Li had plenty of questions asked to him during this semester and he answered each one and tried to make it applicable to the class..| yes. when ever we had doubts in class he gave specific examples considering real life applications.| Yes.| Of course he did aid in my understanding of this subject. I can remember one instance when i asked a question in the class, though the question is somehow not related to the study material but he explained me in such a way that i can never forget that concept..| Her showed us the lab and that helped me a lot to understand the practical application of the theory.| Yes, With the project he helped me a lot in finishing it early.",2017 Spring

Personally, I feel not every student can understand the class and catch up to any Professor. So, it will be helpful if Video lectures are provided to recap what was told exactly.

304,ME 4120,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 11,"argued with students about missing grades.| Great teacher. Gives a lot of examples and works through problems carefully and clearly.| Great teacher..| The instructor taught the course very well. He had a lot of examples and he knew how to explain them well. He could always answer questions with coordinated responses that made sense and were helpful. The student was always thinking in his class about many different situations presented. Finally he had a good respect for the students and what they thought..| Sometimes skips steps like he expects you to know what he is talking about. Very knowledgeable but can't always explain it to the students..| Professor jumps from teaching new material to an example to teaching new material in the middle of the example... Only to never finish the example before starting another example under some ""what if"" conditioning (such as: what if there was a spring added to node 3). Makes lecture hard to follow. Once, there was confusion by numerous students over what was said in a previous lecture and when their concerns were brought to the teacher's attention, the professor had an ""I'm right, you're wrong"" kind of attitude. Would not listen to student's consensus that the professor was in fact wrong about the subject matter..| Good lectures and examples.| Lectures were helpful in learning the subject. Only issue was that classes were sometimes slow-paced.| Dr. Bae did a very good job with examples and clarity of explanations. One thing I would suggest is to explain the entire process of the problem when adding on to a previous example..| very good at explanations and examples. giving us his matlab code so we can try on our own was very nice..| Accent makes him a little hard to understand but it doesn't interfere with his teaching. Treated students well, answered questions clearly, and gave examples for almost every topic..| Dr. Bae is my favorite professor in the engineering department, he makes his class fun and also by going through the material step by step and doing a lot of examples, he makes the classes so easy. His exams are not easy, but if you study hard and pay attention in class, getting an A in his class and his exams are not a problem..| Dr. Bae took a lot of time in class going over examples and really strived to ensure everyone knew what was going on. He took a lot of time getting to know people and remembering them by there face..| his teaching skills are amazing. this is my second class under his guidance and going to take class in next semester too..| Sir was excellent on his teaching part giving different real life examples which students can easily understand and professor respected all individuals and their thoughts listening out to students quietly and gently replying them..| Instructor used to explain topics and examples well and in detail. Instructor used to ask questions during lectures which helps in learning a lot as it helps me to think beyond my limits and to find the answer for the questions instructor had asked. Instructor used to solved many examples in class which had helped me to make my concept more clear for this subject. Also instructor respects each individual and used to solved doubts in class..| Prefer that quizzes cover only material that has had a homework assignment covering it. Its understood that lectures are free game but it's preferable to have spent some time solving prior to being tested over a new subject..| Good teacher.| The teacher was always available during office hours and after class for additional questions on the subject and treated everyone fairly..| Too much Matlab, limit Matlab to the second example of the problem.  Doing it by hand for first example helps to understand what is going on in Matlab..| Matlab experience.| he is very good with all of the mentioned aspects..| Very clear concept and teaching style. excellent explanation.| pretty good explanation",2016 Fall
305,ME 4120,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 12,"focused on matlab even though we where not tested on it. class time was wasted and examples that actual hand calculations where left out in favor of easier to produce but less useful matlab examples. i believe my grade suffered due to these lack of good examples.| Yes, just works hard to explain the material such that it is easy to understand..| Yes. Knows his material well.| The instructor and his notes did a very good job of explaining the subject and how it works. The book was also very good at explaining what needed to be done..| No. I learned everything from reading the book and following the examples inside it. Lectures were hard to follow and the provided notes from the teacher were next to useless when it came to having to actually do any assignment..| Good instructions and clarification of material.| Yes, Dr. Bae helped me to understand the subject. I approached him after class multiple times with questions and he was always willing to give me an answer..| yes very any question he know the subject very well.| Helped me with my homework a few times.| a lot of people told me that FEA is on of the hardest classes in engineering, after taking it with Dr. Bae, i think FEA is one of my favorite classes, Dr. Bae made us understand the material and how does it apply in the real world..| Yes, he provided a multitude of examples and was always good at answer questions.| yes.| Yes Instructor helped me learn and understand the subject as he was always available to clear student doubts. As an example, I use to approach professor during the office hour and he was polite to listen my doubt and clear them immediately..| Yes absolutely, instructor has helped me a lot to understand this subject well. Instructor used to give time after class for clearing my doubts. Also used to explain each topics in details and used to repeat many times so that I can understand well and can get in depth knowledge of this subject. Due to instructor my interest to learn this subject more in depth has increased. This subject has helped to understand the real world problems and how to solve issues in real world..| yes, he is happy to work with any random changes to the problem to demonstrate how to solve different problems..| Yes, he did.| Yes, the instructor did aid in my understanding of the subject as he helped me understand some of the equations for the homework whenever I was stuck..| Yes.| Yes, He is very clear in teaching and making things understandable. He taught the topics with examples, that helped me understand the content more easily..| Yes he did.| pretty good explanation",2016 Fall
306,ME 4120,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 13,I feel the class was very fair and taught well so that it could be understood by the student..| He is one of the better choices of teachers here in ME.| The only time I ever felt that there was a misunderstanding in class that caused a bad grade was during the first quiz. It was not explained well that you don't always assume it hits wall..| Sir has ample of knowledge and understanding about the subject and he is very clear with explanation..| Course structure was also well defined to give clear understanding of this subject..| Homework before quiz on new topics!!.| I have no more comments..| Very good instructor,2016 Fall
307,ME 4120,Ha-Rok Bae,Question 14,"Great Guy. Very Friendly. But please...Do more problem examples in class!!! and please spend a little more time on writing more clear. I have such a struggle reading your hand writing. And when you do examples please start by stating what we are trying to solve for up front. Maybe even include a real world application. Knowing the real world engineering application of a problem before starting it GRABS our attention. Use less MATLAB.....it puts us asleep. Let us know we can use it. But if we cant use it on the exam then whats the purpose. Please do not stop mid problem and solve the rest of a problem in MATLAB. Then my notes are useless. Again, spend a little more time making the HW solutions clear. Some of the Diagrams were very poorly drawn. I would think if 50+ future engineering students are trying to learn a problem you would spend more than 2 seconds on drawing the diagram. Its sad. Im sorry, but its really sad the effort put into some of this class to help the students. If it wasnt for the fact that the book was written so well I probably would fail this class. Take a extra second to make sure the Exam diagrams are clearly stated and drawn... Is that connection pinned or fixed?....It shows pinned but we were suppose to assume fixed even though it was never stated in the Problem? ring a bell? Just take a little more time to make things clear and you could be one of the top EGR teachers..| Sometimes the instructor moved very fast through the material. Some of the homework problems where also not clear on which parts of the problem had to be done..| This class doesn't seem difficult when it gets boiled down to the basics and is explained well but the professor failed in providing a lecture in which the material was given clearly..| nope.| no.| Dr. Bae is the best professor at WSU.| Dr. Bae was a great professor an I would take him again.| Overall the instructor teaching was very good. I had learnt many things from  instructor that has helped me to expand my area of knowledge..| Homework before quiz on new topics!! Didn't like it if it isn't obvious..| I have no more comments..| I feel, the questions he set for the exams are a lot more difficult than what he teaches in the class.",2016 Fall

I also felt that the TA did not explain why we were doing stuff just walked around and assisted when ANSYS broke. Also, I feel like this class should not be taught on Linux systems as its slow and consistently crashes..| Labs were step by step.

388,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 11,"she is the best teacher i had for a design subject, her way of teaching is very easy and she made me like the materials and the subject over all..| We were provided with a number of good, comprehensive examples, questions were answered as thoroughly as time permitted, and critical thinking was fostered in lecture. I exited this class daily feeling like I had been taught well..| excellent professor. probably the best I have ever had. very helpful during office hours, respectful and nice..| Course material was presented in class and then example problems that used the concepts that we taught were done.  The instructor would ask questions to the class regarding the concepts she was teaching.  She was very clear in her explanation of the concepts..| always provided definitions and explanations of the material before providing example problems which was nice.| Handled examples very well.| Good at explaining and plenty of examples and handles questions well and stimulates thought well and gives plenty of respect..| Great instructor. Taught the class well. Gave great examples that were easy to follow, based on her notes that were used to teach the material. Handled questions fairly well. Sometimes though, she gave wrong formulas and did not include all of the formulas that we needed to successfully complete the homework. Her tests correlated very well with the notes that were given in class and nothing was out of the blue. I believe that the teacher knows and understands the material very well, but there is a bit confusion on things here and there. Overall, an effective rate of 90%.| Great example problems were worked out in entirety, very respectful professor..| Dr. Gockel does a good job of avoiding unnecessary information, and the material and exams are straightforward..| She's very good professor, she gives a lot of notes which is good! But she clears the board quickly before we write sometimes. I think that's because the class is just 55 minutes!!! That's too short for Mech design, and it affects us in the exams..| Dr Joy was one of my best instructors that i had in wright state. best thing in her notes is there is a good amount of example that will cover the materials that she went through. she is available in the office hours and she response to my emails very fast..| Please write down the units more on example problems in class. I'll be honest, I sometimes too forget my units. We all do sometimes, but in terms of examples its important becuase its easy to get confused. I think towards the end of the semester you wrote units every time. Other than that you are awesome and funny!.| Example problems really helped explain the material and were good reference to look back on, always willing to answer questions and make sure material was thoroughly explained to confused students, notes taken in class helped, exams seemed fair and we knew exactly what to prepare for..| ..| The book we use is 10th edition, it is international stander, but answer use american stander, that caused me confused a lot during study..| Dr Gockel explained things in depth and very clearly. She used many examples and made sure the class was following along and understanding..| Revise your notes so there are no mistakes. They ultimately make it into our notes..| Great professor! Very helpful in and out of class. Gave fair exams with homework and class examples that were relevant. Would be interested in taking another one of her classes..| She is a great in explaining the material.| Dr. Gockel was very clear in explaining key information in the subject, she was open to questions and would answer leaving students with a better understanding of the topic. Dr. Gockel was very respectful towards myself and classmates.",2016 Fall
389,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"yes she did, she gave us a lot of examples and hints in the class that made the exams and the projects not very hard to do.| Yes. The pace and organization of the class was very logical and I never felt like I was getting into a topic I wasn't prepared for..| yes, she explains the material very clearly and gives great notes besides she is very helpful during office hours..| Yes, the instructor aided in my understanding of the class.  She was always willing to answer any question we had and available in her office hours.  Class was always started on time and she was never late..| yes providing clarity in her example problems.| yes, lectures were very clear.| Yes. Explained thorough and detailed examples in class..| Yes. Gave real-world examples..| Yes, example problems given by professor we're very helpful..| Yes, the classroom instruction and personal study were sufficient..| Yes.| Yes, and I enjoyed your side talks about aerospace..| Yes, always answered questions and tried to clarify to the best of her ability when there was confusion. Didn't try to trip anybody up on exams..| I didn't looking for help a lot, but when i ask help she helps me a lot..| I would have liked to have her teach more classes, I learned a lot from her, she was a great teacher, and was one of the best teachers I have had at WSU..| Yes, projects were a very worth while endeavor..| Yes, she is giving the example that related to the topic in easy way.| Yes, Dr. Gockel aided in my understanding of the subject. During our first class project I had several questions and I was able to meet with her during office hours to get a better understanding of the direction my calculations needed to take.",2016 Fall
390,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"Dr.Gockel. simply the BEST..| none.| Good.| for the quiz, it is hard to prepare it without notice or know which part will be ask..| Nothing.| It was very clear what was expected of me to succeed in this class, as relayed during class, on the syllabus, and during review sessions for exams.",2016 Fall
391,ME 4140,Joy Gockel,Question 14,"best wishes for her.| none.| Non.| I thought it was fun when you brought in the chalk and paper clips into class. It gives us a break from writing and it gives us an opportunity the stop and just think about whats going on..| Really enjoyed the design projects as a way to experience ""real"" engineering as opposed to classroom engineering. Really good way to help start the transition to thinking in terms of the whole structure instead of being concerned with certain points like the homework problems do. Also a good way to start thinking about what to consider, what not to, and how to rank considerations, how to chose materials, etc. A really good change from what has been the normal so far. I also really liked the division of points in this class, where it was easier to recover from a bad exam grade having three midterms and the final wasn't worth a ridiculous amount of points more than the midterms..| Thanks for the great time",2016 Fall

402,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 11,"you where fine, i just want these notifications to end.| The instructor uses Dr. Klingbeil's course notes. I have a copy of these course notes and she taught word for word off of  those notes. If there was a question that was asked that was not on those notes, she simply could not answer it. As such class time was spent just listening to her read word for word off of the notes. If those notes were provided to students and then students just did examples in the class, it would be a much more useful class..| The instructor wasn't very helpful in answering questions from the students. The instructor almost never had a complete answer for a student's question and would always push the questions aside for later and would never follow up on them. Also, there wasn't enough explaining behind why things worked or why the material was used the way it was. There was a lack of detail on the material..| good.| She did a pretty good job at answering the questions raised by the class. She had plenty of examples to help teach the material. She was very good at making us think about the topics that were being talked about. She had a good respect for the student and always tried to help them understand what was going on..| had good examples. Helped with doing the hw..| Everything you learn is copied word for word from the book. You feel like you're wasting your time showing up to class when you know the notes that will be given are straight from the book..| The class was all just examples and it was hard to relate the problems to real life. Exam problems were way too long but the material in them was fair. Not many people finished the exams. Grading on exams was very random with points taken off for certain things. She is a very nice teacher though just needs some work on exam grading and question choosing..| Examples were great, it really helps to run through problems in class, especially with all the tables and when some problems require solving for fifteen different things in a single part to find the final solution. Very respectful, knowledgeable professor and professional in the classroom..| Dr. Gockel was very clear in her notes and lectures, and posed exampled that strongly aided in homework and exams.  She is very respectful to the students..| Goes through a lot of helpful examples in class.| Lectures were well-paced and provided examples. Only issue with lectures was that many of the notes were directly from the book..| It would have helped to have been taught more of the actual theory and applications of the material learned instead of just going by the book and doing examples. Even when we did examples, any questions were usually responded to with ""I don't know, let me check on that"" instead of a clear-cut answer. I could tell she was really trying to do well, but she just needs some more experience teaching the class and a better understanding on how to relay the material..| she did a good job of teaching this class. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course..| I think she is a fine teacher..| Gave several examples, answered questions clearly, corrects herself when a mistake is pointed out, and treats students well. Some students might complain that she spends too much time on formulas and not enough about concepts but I think the formulas are just as important..| I believe this class is a beast in terms of how much material there is to cover. I believe Dr. Gockel did well for her first time teaching it but there is still much room to improve. I don't believe I gained much knowledge at all from the lecture portion of the class as she wrote her notes word for word form previous instructors that just took the book information. I also found the homework often not helpful as it rarely matched with examples in the book or that we did in class and left me wondering how to solve the problems. The number one improvement I believe dr. Gockel could make is having a better understanding of the book and subject so that when questions are asked she is able to answer them quickly. I believe that skill comes with time and I don't fault her for not knowing some of the information. I believe she did a very good job this semester but has a lot to learn and improve upon..| Cool class as a follow up to mech. I. Now we got to design real world components.",2016 Fall
403,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"you where fine, i just want these notifications to end.| The instructor has stated many times that her goal in the course is to not teach the material but make sure that you understand how to find the material in the book on your own, so that you as a professional engineer could just reference the notes when you need them. That is okay I guess, but it is extremely frustrating taking an exam that is basically designed to see if you know how to flip through a book..| No. As already stated, the instructor did not give detailed responses as to why things worked the way they did. Its one thing to show the formulas and solutions from the solution manual but its another to explain to the student why and how the formulas work. Also it is nice to have a picture or video of how things are working, ESPECIALLY in a mechanical engineering course where most things are seen and understood in the physical realm.  I did enjoy how the instructor brought in a sample of a component to a jeep that pertained to the chapter being covered. This is extremely helpful in learning the material!.| yes, by being able to teach us.| She gave very good in class examples and was always available during office hours if extra questions rose up..| yes. gave good examples of differnet situations based on the chapters we were covering..| Yes, very clear in explanations and lecture materials which made the subject matter clear..| Yes, particularly with examples and extra office hours.  I really appreciated the office hours and her willingness to help explain a concept three times until I understood it.| Yes. There was a ton of material to get through so she taught everything fast but well..| Yes. for more complex mechanisms, she would often offer accompanying visual aids such as bringing in physical specimens or watching videos demonstrating processes..| She did aid in my understanding of the subject, but not as well as I would have hoped. Often times when a question was asked, she did not have a very good answer, and just said she would get back to us about it. Hopefully she improves in teaching the class next time since this was her first time teaching it..| yeah she knew it but not much more other then the book. Whenever we ask what would be done in the real world she didn't know much.| Yes, she went through a lot of different examples..| Didn't really need her help with this course.| vadbsh.| Yes, she was often available to meet and help clarify things before exams.| Dr. Gockel is great. Helpful and pragmatic.",2016 Fall
404,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"you where fine, i just want these notifications to end.| I can read the book; I don't need it read to me. This class could cover more material in the same amount of time with the same comprehension, but it is not a bad class..| She is a new professor, and is fairly inexperienced in this material. Over time I believe that her work will improve, its just right now its not great. Plus mechanical engineering needs more women, and seeing a woman teach a class is a great step in the right direction..| The instructor seems to care a lot about the class. I think she is a great professor but just needs to know where the students are coming from and what they're perspective looks like..| The class was well put together but there was to much material to cover in such a short amount of time. It seemed like the instructor had to rush to get through it all but she still did a good job to help us understand what was going on..| I feel like more effort could be put into preparation for each class..| Exams were overly long. It was difficult to show that I understood the subject because I always felt rushed..| I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course..| Byah!!",2016 Fall
405,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 14,"you where fine, i just want these notifications to end.| Great at communication! Love the format of the class. Always has an example problem in lecture! Doing example problems is 80% of what makes a great teacher. Some of the theory sections is just exactly out of the book... Which I understand you have to do. But maybe add a little bit more explanation to it rather than just copying down the book. Other than that great job!.| Seemed to be to much material sometimes and we had to rush through some of it..| Exams are VERY packed for the time frame. Understood that a lot of material is needed to be tested in the time span but consider: shortening the material being tested in a single exam and have more of them to cover the same amount of material (for example: exam one can be two chapters instead of three and then have four midterms instead of three), or generally shorten the exam in number of parts. As of right now, students find it difficult to attempt every part of the exam, let alone have time to double check their answers and look for mistakes (for example: solving a whole problem while forgetting to convert a unit, thus carrying it through all the parts, and distorting all their final answers..| Dr. Gockel is a really good professor, and I would honestly tell everyone who can to take her classes.  She is one of the best professors I have had class with in the Mechanical Engineering department..| I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course. I just wish we learned to design in a mechanical design course..| A lot of the students are very hard on her which is completely uncalled for. She does to the best of her abilities considering this is a tough class with a lot of different aspects..| I am registered with the Office of Disability Services. They changed their policy about test proctoring recently and the instructor was very understanding about it by allowing me to schedule test proctoring earlier..| I believe for Dr. G first time teaching this class it was very well put together. I believe that the quizzes were a little useless as they never helped me understand material better and were really based on how well you remembered a single saying from lecture or where to find info in book. I believe this class would also benefit from being three days a week as the class often felt like it dragged and that there was to much information to comprehend and keep up with the speed of the class. myself and others often felt as though we zoned out by the second half of the class.| ___     ^   ^   ------------                    |",2016 Fall

430,ME 2120,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 11,"When teaching a subject, he would provide examples to make sure we understood the topic..| Lecture was very dry and not interesting. Go through more examples and the process for solving problems..| I definitely like learning the material then using it to solve example problems from the handouts..| teacher was clear and respectful in class and homeowrk helped with tests and learning.| Very respectful and great teacher, requires in class attention quiz which is very helpful into clarifying the material just reviewed and further explained from him..| He was a great teacher, and was able to convey information in a formal way. he is not good when it comes to answering your questions. he either doesnt answer the question you ask or blows off your question completely..| Hard to understand, great personable guy.| Just like every other teacher I've seen in the engineering department, he doesn't answer questions. When someone asks for clarification, he just repeats the same drivel that needed the clarification until the student gives up. In that same vein, he doesn't really teach how to solve the problems he inevitably gives us. He talks about unnecessary side information and says a lot without actually saying anything of importance..| He did very well in the class setting and was always able to answer questions we may have had..| great teacher. learned a lot from the class and liked the way he structured everything..| He was plenty respectful, tried to answer questions to the best of his ability. The examples sometimes seemed long and messy, however I never fully engaged to his examples, If one were to follow the whole time i assume it would be understood..| I feel as though the lecture slides were far too complex for what was trying to be taught.  They went pretty deep into mathematics, but didn't provide enough examples of real-world applications in order to understand the mathematics.  The 'group work' was pretty pointless.  I did enjoy going over certain problems in-class, that is where I learned the most.  If Nikolai would do more in-class examples and more thoroughly walked students through those problems, I think the class would have a much better understanding of what was being taught..| Nikolai was a decent professor.  I believe he could do so much better teaching and really explain the material.  At times, it was somewhat confusing during the lecture.  But he provided many examples that helped prepare for exams..| The instructor was really good and affective.| Professor was efficient in teaching, had good in-class examples and answered questions. Some of the answers were somewhat off topic but effort was made to answer the question. Professor was respectful..| Professor Priezjev is quite possible the best instructor I have ever taken a class from. His lectures are concise and engaging. He thoroughly explains the material and provides relate-able metaphors as well as thorough examples of the application of the concepts..| Very clear on everything. I REALLY liked that he gave us homework print outs. Most things these days are online but having a routine weekly packet was very refreshing..| Some of the instructor's teaching was difficult to understand as there seemed to be a barrier between his understanding of the material and an explanation that could be easily understood. He is clearly very knowledgeable but had trouble communicating his knowledge to us at points.| The instruction was generally fairly clear, though I felt that occasionally the examples didn't prepare me for the homework very well. Moreover, occasionally the handling of questions led to some slight confusion as opposed to further clarity.| I thought Dr. Priezjev had a unique way of explaining tough topics and problems as far as trying his best to make the topics fun and relatable. Although there were times where it was hard to understand what he was trying to do when solving the problem that made it sometimes difficult to understand the topic..| He taught well I thought, but as far as making sure everybody understood the material, he didn't do a good job of that. He handled questions well and respected everyone's  questions/opinions.| The professor did a great job of handling the classroom, instructing the students, answering questions, and explaining the material..| he gives us many examples and thats good..| The instructor was exceptional.| Good examples, good teaching, fair exams..| He was very efficient",2016 Fall

The professor gave examples and 'quizzes' which helped understanding and explained answers and concepts..| Yes.| Yes. My primary understanding of the topics came from the professor (instead of TAs, books etc.).| While the lectures served as a decent introduction to the topic, I never felt like I really understood the material enough to perform in the homework. More discussion on the basic ideas and how to apply them would have helped..| Yes, he gave a bunch of his on methods to make the problems simpler, which gave a different view to the problem giving myself a better understanding of topics which made the subject easier..| He aided slightly, there were some situations where he clarified a lot of stuff like on moments and figuring out forces of trusses..| Yes, the professor did a great job of demonstrating and explaining moments to the students and how to find them based on the given data..| yes but there is a problem, sometimes i have a problem with his accent. overall he's good.| Any question I had, he went above and beyond to help me understand it.| Yes..| Yes, the in class examples",2016 Fall

Not very helpful..| Did not allow class to be very interactive, especially for a programming type of class. Powerpoint lectures did'nt give amount of detail needed to solve problems and projects..| The class is supposed to teach us how to apply numerical methods, not learn Fortran.  Unfortunately, all we are shown in class is Fortran, but then the exams are all handwritten applications of the numerical methods.

I can't tell if he just really didnt want tot each this course or is just a lazy instructor, but I'm convinced its one of those options..| The instructor could not always answer the questions being asked about the topic being presented..| I believe this subject is very important and numerical methods is an extremely useful tool to have in the engineers toolbox, but after leaving this class I have learned absolutely no numerical methods. I have almost a 100% thus far, but can say I learned nothing: nothing on Fortran, nothing on computational methods, and nothing about engineering. If this class were to be reviewed by the ABET accreditation committees I think the college might actually lose its accreditation.  Any student who says this was a useful class, is only saying that because they got an easy, and I mean extremely easy, A; and I honestly believe if the department was to give a basic exam on the concepts or fundamental learned in this class less than 20% would pass.  The entire class all we did was change inputs in code, and plot things. This could have been an online course, because all the professor did was read from the powerpoints and give us the code to modify. A complete waste of my time and money on this course!  A fortran class should be a pre-req as well, because if you actually want us to learn the numerical methods we should understand the language we are coding it in..| The instructor treated students well and handled questions well..| Fortran is really confusing, and the course materials are confusing.  It might be better to use other coding programs which are easier to use and to understand, and more up to date.",2016 Fall
445,ME 4010,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 12,"Yes..| Not really. He needed to go through the code in WAY more detail..| With doing the material by hand yes, the material to be done by Fortran code (majority of the class) no.  There was no guidance on how to create/modify the code necessary to complete coursework..| His lecture notes were very helpful. The majority of the subject was self-taught using the lecture notes..| Yes,brought some applicable example related to the analytical method..| He refused to aid in my understanding of this subject. Whenever he was asked to go over something by doing an example to show us work, he refused and told us to study at home. He didnt provide us with solutions to any homeworks or study guides. Also, he never lectured on how to actually code Fortran, even though that was the only software we were permitted to use for our projects..| No, many times told us to Google something to figure it out; when it should have been something that was taught in the class..| Not at all, and anyone who says this is true is only saying that because they received an EASY A. I have a very high GPA, well within the top 10% of the graduating class and I know I did not learn anything about numerical methods from the coursework provided or the instruction given. Any student who walks out of this class thinking they learned numerical methods is either completely oblivious to education or is just being nice on this review..| The instructor did aid in my understanding of this subject.

446,ME 4010,Nikolai Priezjev,Question 13,"none..| Class was cancelled about 1/3 of the time. I feel like I should submit a bill to the University demanding 1/3 of my tuition back..| This class is less of a computational methods class, and more of a Fortran coding class without any instruction in Fortran. It would be much more helpful if we were permitted to use a computational software we are accustomed to, like MATLAB, or teach us a language that will be used in this age, such as Python or something that isnt outdated..| In the future there needs to be a Fortran class before having to take this one. Most of the class was to busy trying to figure out how to write a code and what it meant to be able to focus on what this class was suppose to be about..| Useless, uneducating, waste of my time and money, and above all the MME department should be guilty/apologetic graduating students whom have taken this course and are expected to know numerical methods as engineers..| I was required to use the Fortran computer program to complete assignments. I had no prior experience in using it before taking this course, making it difficult to complete assignments",2016 Fall

472,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 11,"Good at explainingcovered entire textbook and topic.| Explanations in class were clear. Any questions were addressed well. However, I think the understanding of the class would be better tested by the instructor asking the class questions about the material rather than just asking if there are any questions after covering a section. This would prove to us what we do or don't understand in real time. Additionally, I would have preferred that more time was spent on examples of using the material. Although I do realize the importance of working through the derivations and understanding where the equations come from, the material becomes more interesting and easier to remember if I have the experience of using it in some fashion..| The Instructor did well making complex methods easier to digest, one suggestion is maybe explaining why certain equations are being derived rather than spending an hour deriving the equations and then explaining the significance of it..| very well organized examples.| A recap of the earlier class when the the topic is continued in the next class will be greatly helpful.| Dr. Yang was a fantastic professor! He has a very clear teaching style. Things that I liked about his teaching: * Making notes available online - The notes posted online were very helpful as I was able to bring them to class and make additions to during class. * Drawing diagrams for each section - The diagrams that Dr. Yang drew to help represent the content of each section were very helpful. They made it much easier to visualize the flow and understand the subject.  * Great in class examples - I really appreciate the in class examples that were covered. They were very helpful in understanding the content. * Bonus Quizzes- bonus quizzes were not only great motivation to come to class but were also great to help check our understanding of knowledge. I was able to gauge my understanding of content based on how well I was able to complete the quizzes.  * Projects - I really enjoyed the projects. I was able to dive deeper into the content and I found it very interesting. I felt that I was able to learn a lot of information through the projects.  Overall the course was fantastic! Guidelines and expectations were very clear and the content was interesting..| He knows what he says , has a good knowledge in the subject and is supportive, treats everyone in the same way with no preferences.| yes he has good clarity in what he was explaining and course was well organised..| Effective.| Professor explained every aspect as we can understand them with ease Gave good examples for the topics.| Very good.| Highly encouraging.| good.| The professors teaching style is quite good in my opinion.

I enjoyed his class and he was very personable in his approach to teaching..| The labs were not clear with detailed steps for some labs. Lots of information was left out making us ask alot of questions..| examples in class were helpful. it would have been nice if homework was posted on pilot..| He was very nice. I could tell he cared about his students and wanted to teach us knowledge to help us in the real world. The class itself is really a boring subject and difficult to teach.| I'm really going to miss this class, because I really enjoyed how well you taught the class. This course was challenging, but you made it enjoyable by the examples and applications of where this stuff is used in the real world. I also liked the pace of this , because other classes try and jam so much material into the course and give so much work that it becomes stressful and you don't really get anything out of it. I know engineering is hard and stressful but this class was taught at just the right speed for me. If you had a class where you just talked about engineering in the real world and the experiences you had I would diffidently take it. The talk you had about the amount of air per cubic foot in the earths atmosphere verses in the amount in space really caused me to think. I understood what you were talking about, but it just made me think outside of class and the more I thought about it the more stuff started to make sense. Hopefully all this made sense..| I felt we moved through the demonstration of LabVIEW too quickly. We kinda blew threw it quickly a couple of times and then were expected to know where everything was for the rest of the experiments. Was willing to help to sort out problems during the experiments, program problems, etc..| The labs were easy to follow as long as the equipment was working.

Questions were asked in the labs that didn't seem all that relevant. Example: Didn't have a clue what filtering, transmission or resonance were for Lab 7, never really covered.

Great professor, I learned a lot and I was taught well. Lectures were informative, the handout's were well prepared, coherent, and informative..| This instructor was very clear during his examples and made following his notes extremely easy for such difficult coursework, the professor was also very respectful I would definitely recommend him..| I could have benefited from more example problems instead of all the derivations of the equations..| Very good at explaining the concepts. clear and had good visuals for examples..| very clear and gives good examples..| I think the course set-up was great.  He was very organized with his lectures and lecture notes.  Material was covered in a timely and very informative manner..| He was good at explaining things, and he gave a lot of examples..| Focuses on theory over examples..| Great professor, hard material to learn. I think he does a good job of teaching it to the class..| Dr. Sucosky is obviously proficient in his field, and does not waste class time. However I believe most students would benefit from more practical example problems rather than the highly conceptual problems typically used..| The instructor does very well with teaching. However, there have been plenty of times in class where I felt I was trying to keep up with him in just taking notes. This wouldn't let me hear some of the explanations behind derivations or equations..| Very clear and straightforward. Makes learning this class much easier..| His explanations and examples were very clear and helpful. He also pushed us to do well in the course, but none of his expectations, assignments, or exams were unreasonable..| He didn't waste any class time. The notes were very helpful and he had each class planned out property. Very professional.| First off, this class is the most difficult course that I have taken in college. That considered, Professor Sucosky did a great job of explaining the material in such a way that it gave me a fair chance of learning this difficult subject. All questions that students had were handled with great respect, which I am sure that everyone appreciated..| I think that he does very well with answering questions..| Explanations were very well done. The subject was very challenging but when I finally understood how he structured the material, it became more clear. He was very good about taking, and answering, questions outside of the class..| The handout system that he used for this course was very effective..| Good. Clear expectations. Hard class..| The handouts were very helpful in going in more depth on some concepts. Make referencing concepts much easier as well as working through problems. Office hours were helpful. Helped me understand more than one homework assignment. Very challenging class, wish there were some more example problems during the lecture, nothing too difficult, just a brief explanation of how it all works. Very challenging class, but doable if effort is put in outside of class. Review sessions for exams very helpful. Keep those up..| Great instructor. Did everything you would want from a great professor.| Two things that you can do to make the material a bit easier is to explain the fluid dynamic terms clearly before using that term for the rest of the class.  In other words put the meaning of the term into layman's terms.  Secondly, you need to work more examples rather than going through the derivations that where over my head most of the time.  Lastly, make the homework easier so that one can implement the simple equations in class, ultimately ingraining the basics.   Overall, you are more that fair to the students, and I will definitely recommend your course..| Excellent teaching style. Really learned a lot..| The first test was very difficult to prepare for. It wasn't until after the first test that I was able to properly prepare myself to take an exam in my opinion. I was unclear on how to prepare for the tests until after I had received a poor grade on the first one and had to make those corrections. Normally I would assume that it was just me misunderstanding the instructor, but I spoke with multiple people who felt the same way. Maybe doing more review problems and showing students how to utilize with handouts will eliminate some of the poor grades on the first exam. It would also be nice if there were more review material distributed since the homework is made exceptionally more difficult than the exams. Other than that, very informative lectures, I really liked the handouts, tests were fair (once I knew how to prepare for them).| he is not good at explain , I don't learn any thing.| The class periods were very organized and easy to follow. I enjoyed listening and taking notes in class..| Instructor's teaching was straightforward. Definitely stimulated thinking..| Dr. Sucosky was very clear in his explanations of subject material and would clarify any questions students had on the material. He would stimulate our thinking by use of handouts. Very respectful of the individual..| Very brilliant man, unfortunately his teaching style tailors only towards the conceptual thinkers. In my opinion he shouldn't have spend all class writing notes for us to copy word for word. That was a big waste of time considering time was an issue in his class. Instead, he should have had the notes already written and he should have merely gone over them in class. If he wanted us to have those specific notes then he could have sent us them through email. The time in class should have been spent doing real world examples and explaining why we use each technique for those examples. The exams were very fair and I greatly appreciated the review session. I greatly disagree that one bad exam grade can lower your average by an obscene amount, but that is not really his fault as much as it is the university's..| overall, the course went well. Philippe Sucosky gave very detailed lectures, notes and handouts. the homeworks were really difficult.  however, the lectures were kinda dry. they were sometimes too mathematical. students were struggling with the materials due to lack of specific examples. i think",2016 Fall

His notes were very helpful, he was available for consultation, and he connected the class to real world examples and applications..| He showed videos and real world example in the lecture.| The many handouts that Professor Sucosky made available to the class were a great help due to the information and example problems that they contained. As the course went on, I appreciated them more and more and relied on them greatly to gain an understanding of the material..| Yes. Mostly because I knew nothing about this subject, but know I can come out of the class definitely having retained information..| Yes very much so. He was willing to meet me outside of class and regularly scheduled office hours to explain things that I was struggling with. He was also willing to explain things in different ways to aid in my understanding..| I often went to his office hours for help with the homework and he really helped me understand what was going on and got me on the right track with the problems..| Yes.| Yes. Broke down difficult ideas into more manageable parts..| Refer to last post..| No, it's like calculus not more than that.| He did aid in my understanding of fluids. As an example, when we talked about streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines, he showed real examples of how they can be used. I really enjoyed watching the video or the race car with the smoke lines running over it. I went home and looked up a bunch more videos like it..| Dr. Sucosky implemented the use of handouts that made complex theories and examples easier to understand and to follow along with..| I am not much of a conceptual thinker and I cannot pay attention to a man speaking for 55 straight minutes, so I did not learn much from this class unfortunately.

All and all great instructor!.| I think it would be beneficial to have either more examples worked in class or possibly have an optional recitation type class set up to go over additional problems. If it were in class it would take away more time, so that's why I suggest having that other class period to give more understanding to the problems.

I had a difficult time with learning how to apply what he was teaching if I was being told that the book nor the homework would help with tests.  What I mean by that is that normally, I could read a text book, and as long as I could follow along and work through the example problems and understand what I was doing then I would well on the exams.  But for this class I'm being told that the book won't help me.  And normally I could work through homework problems and as long as I understood what I was doing then I'd do okay on exams, but for this class I'm being told that the homework is harder than exam problems so studying from them wouldn't be helpful either. So all I have are the notes, and practice exams that he gives us, but aside from the practice exam what other way am I supposed to practice applying the theory? Obviously the exam problems won't be exactly like the practice problems, so what other way do I have to prepare myself for varying types of questions that he could give?

I think I have a lot improvement by his class. I like his class..| Everyone who is doing research work in the field in Wright State, should take this course.",2016 Fall
518,ME 1020,Scott Thomas,Question 1,"He was very effective.  Whenever he taught a new topic, he would do examples for us to follow along.  He also helped us on our assignments..| it was so good.| Great instructor, always will to help with anything I didn't understand..| Very nice and always willing to help..| Better as the semester continued, but still has found an effective way to teach this particular subject..| The instructor is mostly effective in teaching the subject. However, I think that more guided examples in class would be very beneficial..| Instructor does alright. I understand that he hasn't been teaching the topic for very long, but the current method isn't very effective for me..| very helpful and is able to answer any questions.| Very effective..| Okay!!.| Very helping.| great and handy..| bad.| Scott is good instructor but his plan about the grades  not helping the students!.| great.| good.| No.| not bad.| Scott is a great teacher.| He is always trying to explain the material, and make his students good at matlab.| he is good.| Normal.| good.| i taught in a way that made me understand the concept at hand.| good.| The instructor's effectiveness was overall pretty well in terms of teaching the course material..| it was very useful.| The effectiveness was fairly good. Each class, we knew what we were going to learn and that we could come to him with any and all questions and he would gladly answer them. Definitely one of the nicest teachers on campus. The only thing that I would change with the way of teaching would be to do more in class examples. Instead of just going over the notes slides, during each class period he could pick a problem or two out of the book and work them out with the class. Having the problem on the board and having us tell him what code to put into matlab and if we are incorrect, correcting us and explaining the reasoning behind it. I believe this could make the class much easier, instead of being more independent having group practice like that stated above..| He was pretty effective for this course. A few things I had to re ask him and ask if he could explain it in a different way, but overall good..| Very effective.| About half the time it made since and the other half was difficult.| good.| Dr. Thomas has an effective teaching style.  The fact that you are given examples to work during class and assistance from both him and teaching assistance while  completing these exercises helps to understand the problem and the solution.  My only suggestion would be to add Tegrity based recordings of examples so that students could review these outside of classroom for reference and when they miss lectures..| Great guy but I didn't really feel like he taught anything until the end we just worked on homework and asked questions at the beginning then at the end of the semester he started doing more teaching..| Thomas is a good professor and a good person, but the class wasn't set up well to showcase his ability. He talked/lectured on topics in the first 10 to 20, sometimes 30 minutes of class then moved into open lab where students could get class work or homework done for practice. If you didn't know what you doing, much like myself many times, then you had to wait for one of 2 TAs to come and help you. so the classwork moved slow",2015 Fall

They did have the option to leave early, if they wanted to..| yeah.| Yes..| Always on time. It would have been nice to have worked on things together as a class, rather than by ourselves with the answers in front of us..| yes.| Class was always on time but I did not always find use of the class period helpful.

Made our growth of knowledge feel extremely valuable..| he always asked questions making sure everyone understood and would walk around asking if anyone had any questions..| go in each student every class asking if there is any question....| He did well with this.| good.| Dr. Thomas demonstrates this by lecturing for only a portion of the class and then assisting students the rest of the class..| he talked of projects he has participated in/supervised and about just how important matlab is in today's engineering world",2015 Fall

I feel like that would have helped make the information and codes make sense..| yes.| Well organized.| yes.| I would have liked some of the later lectures to go more in depth as to what the code was actually doing, instead of just saying: ""This is the problem, this is the code."" Some of the functions we used in the code I looked up in the help feature of matlab to learn how to use them. This may have been intentional, though..| Yes..| Yes, kind of.| yes.| yes.| yes.| yes.| No.| NO.| No.  Scott is a great instructor in all other class, except for Matlab. his lecture style is like self learning.

525,ME 1020,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"He's very enthusiastic about every subject he teaches..| The only improvement I feel that could be made would be to put more of an emphasis on the for and while loops section. This by far was the most difficult part of the class in my opinion. Also I really appreciated how the Dr. Thomas had the syllabus laid out with all of the material including the homework's. This gave me a complete heads up as to what had to be completed and when it had to be done by..| I really appreciated just how caring of an instructor he is. He is also one of the most fair professors i have ever had. It was very appreciated!.| It might help for him to do more examples during class time, to make going to class a learning experience and less of a lab time..| The class went okay. The only thing I wish we did more of was guided examples..| The structure of teaching the course could use some tweaking. Rather than expecting us to read and learn outside of class and do problems in class, it would be more beneficial to have a 50/50 of lecture and problem solving during class meetings. The way it is set up gives no motivation to attend class. Also, rather than having students solve problems themselves, it would be more helpful to go through the problems with the class to understand the thinking behind each step..| Nothing to add. Thank you..| No, and keep it like this.| The professor gives the exact way to success the class..| no.| just to make more grades on homework and other staf to make the pass not tough.| no.| NO.| This course supposed to teach me how to deal with Matlab and how to be able  to solve complicated engineering application. One unreasonable chalange i incounteres is i had to solve applications from classes that we didn't take yet. For instance sometimes we want to solve problems from calculas III while i am unable to do them with a pincle and a paper Another thing, you are extremely fair.  I really appreciate that  and I know you are trying to be fair because you want to treet everyone  equally. But that is not right because it's not justic to be fair with every one.   Students  who came to every single class  and do bad on the test are not the same as students who don't come to one class and do bad on the test..| No.| the second midterm was little bit hard.| Explain more in the lectures.| no.| nope.| Instead of having a full work day it would be more beneficial to the students to go over the in class assignment questions or do more sample questions in order to get a larger variety of the types of questions that will be asked and a overall better understanding of the material..| i wish exams content would be more clear.| None other than that stated in '1'..| overall a good professor.| NO, everything was great to learn.| good.| Given Dr. Thomas' format for teaching I would recommend him to any fellow students and consider taking other classes he teaches as technical electives, since they are not required for my major..| no",2015 Fall
526,ME 1020,Scott Thomas,Question 1,"The instructor was effective in explaining material as well as explaining any problems..| He was very helpful when i needed it and overall he was very nice..| He is very good instructor, but he is very mean in the exam.| Good teacher.| This instructor was very helpful and communicative throughout the entire professor..| Very poor, i know hes a good teacher in other classes but in this one, he failed to teach.

He helped out a lot..| great instructor, easy to talk to and approach..| Goodish.| For what the course is Scott Thomas did a good job. With something like MatLab the course is bound to be more like a workshop then a lecture..| He along with the TA's helped with specific problems students had, however most learning was strictly from the book/ through homework..| I would describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor as minimal, because he did not lecture or go into detail on how to go about solving a problem.

Then we hav class workform the rsest of time and the TA 's were never vere y help full, Thomas was a good helper but not a got teacher..| Not at all helpful.| Cool guy but needs to spend more time going over the basics and in more detail..| When Dr. Thomas actually decided to teach he was pretty effective but this was a rare event as it was often just a ""do your own work and if you have questions we'll try to help"". When questions were asked it was hard to get a definite answer as it seemed like Dr. Thomas wasn't very sure of how to do a lot of the problems..| The instructor is enthusiastic about the subject but teaching is still hard to find. Solutions are given for problems but some are very hard to follow. Programming of any kind benefits greatly from good examples..| Good.| The instructor was very good teaching and helping the students..| Moderately high. Scott is a very approachable and informative professor. However, I do not agree with his ""teach yourself"" hands-off style. As he did actively hold lecture, it only accounted for about 40 percent of class time, which I found to be ineffective..| Scott Thomas was a very effective instructor, his teaching style improved greatly as he went throughout the semester, and he applied his real world experience he had personally to the course in order to keep me engaged..| pretty effective..| Very effective by describing the material behind the course as well as showing numerous examples..| He gave us plenty of lab time, and would walk around answering questions. However, lectures seemed fairly short with not enough examples..| Professor Thomas is an extremely nice guy and it very helpful when you ask him questions. He knows what he is talking about for sure..| The instructor was available for extra help out of the class room, and was great about explaining the topic. He paid extra attention to those select few students who showed that they would put in the effort for his class. overall perfect professor for the position..| excellent.| The instructor was not very effective; most of the time we were working on our own and the only interaction we had with the professor was if we had questions regarding our programming. He did lecture occasionally, but for the most part we were left to learn the material on our own..| was a very good instructor. needs some improvement for lecturing but very easy to talk to.| Dr. Thomas is a very nice guy, but he is not very effective in teaching the material.  He relies solely on the handouts he's already prepared and loaded on Pilot.  The classes are basically free-for-all, as he and the TA's walk around looking for questions to answer.

He also talked about what was expected in class..| yes.| Yes.| Yes..| Scott Thomas was very strict on his syllabus to an unreasonable point. As a freshman, I did not fully understand my rights as a student and I feel he took some advantage of that with his testing policy. I was required to attend a family funeral as a pallbearer and asked if I could either take the test early or late due to the time and date of the funeral being at the same time as the test. I offered to present proof and anything else needed, however he simply answered with the syllabus clearly stating the policy of tests not being made up ""for any reason"".

Those who were good at teaching themselves and learning from the book or were already well versed in programming succeeded in the class, while those who really need an instructor struggled. This may simply be due to the nature of Matlab, however I did not feel like I learned anything from Scott himself. I was able to learn some simple concepts on my own, but once the class reached more technical points that I needed help understanding, I felt that there was really nothing I could do.

As well as the test being unreasonably difficult, for an already difficult class..| Professor Thomas is a very cool guy and knows Matlab very well. Very helpful and easy to understand, willing to ""dumb"" down things to make it simpler for students to understand.

But other than that, the class is great and I have learned a great deal about the Matlab program..| no.| I have no additional comments..| no.| I am disappointed in his class and ability to teach, and I will search out different professors for my classes going forward.",2015 Fall

549,ME 3310,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"Thermodynamics with Scott Thomas was really great, he showed interest if we were learning, he was fair on the tests, great lessons with lot of examples, the solved exercises on his page are really helpfull for the complete understand of some exercises, also the old tests makes you confortable about what expect from the text. I'm pretty confident about what I learn on Thermo I because of the professor..| no.| No.| it was great, challenging, but not ridiculously challenging like Dr. Wolff..| 10/10.| He's easily the best instructor I've had so far in the mechanical engineering classes..| don't add more maeterial try cover the other stuff better and go over it slower the class was to fast to learn.| I understand it was a hassle, but posting recordings of the lectures when I was in the class before was extraordinarily helpful for both cases of absence and for studying/reviewing material..| I like your teaching style, I think your exams can be a little hard, (especially the second one), but I enjoy you as a teacher and look forward to taking classes with you again..| Great guy, great professor..| Exams are a little tough and the grading is not reasonable with the entire class as a whole. I suggest revising the grading to help with some of the loop holes. Overall great class though..| No.| I have enjoyed Dr. Thomas' class and will look for future courses taught by him..| I wish the exams were a little easier..| The class was taught very well. At the end though it seemed to start to rush a bit through the topics..| In previous semesters of this class, they did not teach Gas Power cycles. With the difficulty of the entire class material as well as the difficulty of gas power cycles, it is overwelhming. I would prefer to drop the Gas Power Cycles to have more time for the other material. Gas Power Cycles feel like they were just tacked into the course..| It was a pleasure to have had Dr. Scott Thomas as an instructor for Thermodynamics.| Keep up the good work scott. you do a good job at teaching -Bret Kindred.| Hard Exams.| the exams are almost impossible, everyone went into them knowing they would fail..| I like that he gives all the solutions to the homework and exams online. I am not sure why other teachers do not to this because the only way I can learn from my mistakes is if I know the solution. Scott is always thinking about what works best for the students. Definitely, one of the best professors at Wright State and one the only teachers I have ever had who will do whatever it takes to teach effectively..| It's a difficult class, but he teaches it well..| No..| Best teacher I've had in the 3 years I've been at Wright State.| Scott is a great teacher. He is hard but very fair..| I like taking his classes because I know I will learn a ton more than other teachers. but I hate the fact I might fail based off the exams being so hard. also there are grad student in the class and they are counted towards our curve and that's not fair. also the student who are taking the class for the second time should also be graded separate from the regular students. anything you take for a second time your going to be much better at than everyone else..| He is very enthusiastic about all of the subjects he teaches..| Keep up the good work!.| He is a really good professor. One of the best ones that I have had at Wright State University. Little tricky on tests, but very transparent about everything..| Great teacher that cares a lot about the students and subjects he teaches. The only issue is tests are extremely difficult..| No.| No..| He is very encouraging,motivating and inspirational teacher I have had so far..| Slow down focus more on why you can make the assumptions, adding the content of power cycles is overwhelming in 3 days. Spend more time on First law and make sure that the assumptions you will be using can be common knowledge rather than a stumping factor through the remainder of the class..| no.| No.| No.| I think that this material comes as second nature to Dr. Thomas, either through years of repetition or through natural giftedness, but that makes it difficult to learn because he skips a lot of foundational concepts that are easy for him.

I don't know if there was a way to break it down more, but overall she taught it straightforwardly..| yes.| Yes every technique following the order in the textbook was explained in same manner. However, unrequired course material from the book was explained but not in depth, thus covering every phenomena..| yes.| Yes.| The chronology of the content flowed well in the beginning with optical microscopy and then general electron microscopy, but there was quite a bit of ""jumping around"" between scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

I would have liked to be there for the EDS reading, even if we had to reschedule it for another week. Being handed magical numbers from nowhere is not reassuring. Please set up the XRD machine that you said you have..| I enjoyed this lab section..| Appreciate not having a unique class time for lab.| Since this is the first class where materials science students get hands-on experience with equipment and instruments, there should be more opportunity for students to use and have access to these precision instruments before this senior-level course and more opportunity in ME 4750.",2015 Fall

I am going to go out on a limb and say it was actually fun to take because of that (sort of like how solving puzzles can be fun)..| No more comments..| If one have to give an excellency award to a professor, he would stand first on the queue..| no.| Better use presentations when ever we need to draw something so as we can save some time..| No..| no.| I think the section the that was presented in the solar thermal class on radiation on a panel takes away from the remainder of the class.  It kept students from focusing on understanding photovoltaic operation. It seemed time consuming for what we got out of it.  It seemed unfair to students who had not had the Solar Thermal class.",2015 Fall
630,ME 2700,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"He tried to show good examples in class but it was hard to understand what he meant sometimes. He was very knowledgeable on the subject..| He conveyed the information pretty well, and was fairly responsive to questions..| Reasenable.| Low level of effectiveness. Was late to all but two classes, including midterms. He was extremely disrespectful to students when they had questions. Very late on grading. Does not return exams, which leads me to believe that he is simply lazy, and does not want students to compare his grading. This leaves grading entirely at his discretion, so he can play favorites..| This professor had very detailed lectures but, his homework and his tests seemed to very alot from what he taught in class..| The instructor was, overall, fairly effective. He explained the material clearly and, through assigned presentations, helped us connect the material with real-world applications..| horrible, did not learn anything from him.| Good.| Very bad,worst-he gave the exam questions that he did not teach..| below average.| Overall it's obvious the instructor knew the information. However that did not always translate to teaching. He did a good job of going over all the general subjects in class. When it came to specific problems such as, homework, exams, and in class quizzes, he did not explain very well beforehand. I had to use other sources to teach myself how to begin the homework, I think if he had given more exam type/homework questions in class, I would have learned better..| The worst professor I have ever had..| Horrible. Constantly showed up late to class and to exams. Also tested us on content that wasn't taught, but was in the book, which we were told ""Was not required""..| The instructor was not very clear in his explanations of various parts of the material. I felt that how well I did on exams came down to how many equations I wrote on my formula sheet..| god awful.| Not good.| Good.| His teaching skills are perfect and can describe the course content in easy way to understand it.| Overall, Dr. Farajian reinforces a demeanor in his class room that emphasizes that he does not take student learning seriously. He does this by regularly arriving to class late, giving tests that do not adhere to class material, assigning projects that do not contribute to furthering our understanding of the subject, and returning graded material back to students several weeks after the promised return date..| good.| Very knowledgeable. Goes into significant detail explaining concepts..| The instructor did a good job at presenting all of the material that was needed in the course..| good.| 7/10.| He explained the most important points very well and spent them more time than the unnecessary facts.,",2015 Fall

Class seemed to lack structure..| The instructor did evaluate all coursework based on the expectations in the syllabus..| no, because what was on the exams was nothing close to what we ""learnt"" in class.| yes.| No,he did not. He missed out important points in class and asked those points in exam. He could have described and imparted knowledge on us but he did not. He taught the easiest parts in the syllabus and gave the questions out of the blue..| no.| When it came to the group projects, the instructor followed the syllabus expectations exactly. There was no confusion to that. When it came to exam grading scales was where some were confused..| Not one bit..| Technically, yes. But the syllabus was so vague in accordance with grades and the grading scale that you never knew what you were gonna get, especially when applied to group projects..| Mostly, except one instance in which somehow a PDF file that contained a group paper for my first group project could not be opened. Instead of contacting our group and letting us know about the issue, he simply gave us a grade of 60%, without ever reviewing the actual paper..| kinda.| No he was all over the place.| Yes.| Yest.| good.| Yes except project work requirements were not clearly stated..| Yes..| Good.| yes.| Yes, I think so.",2015 Fall

He used what time remained after that very well though..| No, he was always 5 minutes late, also he shows up late for every test.| Was only on time TWICE the entire semester, he was even late to our exam sessions. This is incredibly disrespectful. We students added up all the class time he missed because he was late, and it added up to three total hours, which equates to a week of class. I will be looking to have this refunded by the University,.| No, he was often late to class..| The instructor hardly ever started class on time; usually he arrived between 5 and 10 minutes late, and he often adjourned class early..| no, he was always a minimum of 5 minutes late, most of the time he was closer to 15 minutes late.| yes, almost..| No,he always came late to class.

Sometimes he didn't understand students' questions..| About as effectively as you can ask any person to communicate..| Never needed.| Never responded to email, danced around questions when he didn't know the answers in class..| Emailed important information to students when necessary, but often at the latest possible time. For example, when a test is coming up he will give us a list of topics to study, but that list often comes the day right before the test. Not much time to perpare. Or he wont give us assigned groups/topics till 1 week before the project is due. Not much time to work together as a team and compile a well constructed project..| The instructor communicated effectively, but often did not give feedback and study guides in a reasonable amount of time. For one of the exams, he posted the study guide the morning of the exam, and we only got one of 8 in class quizzes back through the entire semester..| he didn't even try.| good.| BAd.

Always sent out emails/upload homework at the last minute. Because of that, you wouldn't have enough time to get things done.| Did not effectively communicate at all. He actually chose class representatives for students to tell about their problems so that he would not have to deal with the various complaints and concerns of a mostly confused classroom that was representative of his poor teaching ability..| bad he did not help much in office hours.| He was hardly ever avaliable for consultation.| Bad.| Good.| Poorly. After the first exam, students were caught off guard by the material on the first test as it seemed to differ from what was taught in class and on the homework for at least half the test. On the next test, we requested a study guide that would help us figure out where the he was pulling information from. He reluctantly provided a study guide that we discovered to be an outline of the section headers of our textbook showing once again little thought was put into the material he was providing..| good.| Email communication was prompt and helpful..| He didn't fully define what he meant in his explanations..| Good.| very.| Very effective.

However, I wish he would have uploaded his slides onto pilot for review. I realize this might not have been possible, since he used the notepad on the projectors..| No..| No. The lecture seemed to bounce all over the place with concepts and none of the knowledge was retained because you never went in depth with some of the topics..| The course content was well organized, yet the lectures did not seem to help in making sense of a good portion of the content.

He was very helpful to go to in office hours as well..| He helped me a lot..| .........| He is really enthusiastic about the topic and really wants us to understand the material..| I enjoyed his slideshow with the jokes..| TRYING TO RELATE EVERYTHING TO REAL LIFE SITUATION.| The instructor took a survey mid semester to survey the class response and feelings about his teaching..| The instructor would repeatedly ask if the class was understanding the material..| Not sure what this question is asking.| He asked for questions and input regularly, and seemed interested in our understanding the material..| he seemed like he cared a lot but had a hard time teaching.| sort of, he eventually changed powerpoint format so he could post it on pilot..| Did not demonstrate interest.| He had us do midterm evaluations to try to better understand how he could improve the course.| In class questions were answered promptly and well..| He was enthusiastic and I enjoyed the jokes he put into the slides..| Pauses lecture to answer any questions.",2015 Fall
650,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 5,"Being in a big classroom, and the instructor having a foreign accent, it was often times tough to hear him..| good.| He was fast to communicate.| He was well spoken..| Poor communication in class, focused on simple concepts for too long.| Fairly effectively. I feel as though the class itself hampered attempts..| Effectively when needed.| it was okay.| Poorly.| Professor communicated poorly in class. It was hard to follow along with his lecture..| Dr. Mian worked hard to improve thoughtout the semester. It seems that english is not Dr. Mian's first language and he would sometimes struggle to get his point out..| Well in both cases..| I did not see the instructor out of the classroom but in the classroom he always seemed to get lost in the questions that he was asking..| Well.| He occasionally does not answer questions in a clear manner..| There were some difficulties communicating due to his accent and phrasing..| well..| In class - Terrible. Never finished examples, got easily side tracked, couldn't the parts of examples he did do without pausing multiple times to look up how to proceed with the problem. Passed out exams by calling names but never kept control over the volume of noise in the classroom so it was difficult to hear who's name was being called by him since he's so quiet. Out of class - Emailed occasionally about online quizzes, posting of homework, or days that he'd be unavailable and thus no lecture on that day..| NO.| Well.| Extremely poorly..| perfect..| Assignments were posted in a timely manner and at no point was I ever confused about when assignments were due. This is something Dr. Mian did well at..| Very well.| He responds very quickly to emails. Very helpful!.| Fairly well with questions in class.  Never tried contacting him out of class..| decently he was always in his office when I needed him but going to ask him a question I was more confused then before.| Pretty good..| Jumping around, however by the end of the semester, he was very straight forward. A lot of improvements happened during the course..| He communicate very good inside and outside the classroom.| The instructor returned graded work in a timely manner, as well as updated grades regularly..| Greatly.| fine.| The instructor had troubles keeping the classes attention, the classroom (144 Russ) chairs are incredibly distracting because of the noise they make with the slightest movement..| Very effectively through email..| He was fine at sending out emails, that's about it..| He clearly stated what was expected and he would email us and post on pilot if anything had changed from what he told us in class..| Not good..| .........| He was very effective in communication..| The professor was able to communicate effectively as far as assignments being assigned and when they where due. His examples were unclear at times because he would go on tangents about something in the problem and it was very difficult to follow him. I would suggest he work all the way through the example first then go back and bring up the point he wants to emphasize..| RELLY GOOD.| In the class room the communication was sub-par. Outside is unknown..| Communication was better through Pilot and emails than it was in the class..| Well.| Explanations could have been clearer, and it seemed as though he was unsure of some details during examples..| communication was okay in the class room. out side he had office hour that was better.| Not at all. Once again, he rambled..| semi effectively.| good.| Pretty good.  Accent sometimes difficult to understand, but that's not really his fault..| He communicated very well and was always sending out emails and posting on pilot for information..| Communication in class needs improvement. The instructor stammers a lot. Communication out of class is better and doesn't stammer as much.",2015 Fall
651,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 6,"Not really. Very unorganized, did not seem to prepare too much for lecturs outside of class..| good.| They were not well organized at all. He would switch back and forth from the power point to him trying to do examples that were poorly put together on the board. Then we would discuss topics that should have been learned in the pre-requisite classes. I do not feel like I have learned the proper material for this class to say that I have any understanding of the material..| Yes.  Some notes could have been more organized..| Course and lectures very far behind schedule, 6 weeks for less than 2 chapters with 6-7 condensed into remaining 9 weeks.| Yes, especially after midpoint eval..| Yes.| yes but he was so far behind in class.| No..| No, not at all..| Dr. Mian's lecures were not well organized or structured but did improve over the course of the semester..| Yes..| The lectures seemed well organized but not many of them were used because to much time was spent going over old material..| No. They were not organized at all. Pick teaching style and stick with it. Don't switch between PowerPoint and board. If you wish to do powerpoint and board dont keep putting the screen down and up leave it up and keep it there..| For the most part, yes..| No, the class was constantly behind schedule due to the instructors inability to present material in a progressive manner. The instructor would constantly loop information and would make little progress during the lecture..| not at all..| No. No. No no no no no. Absolutely not. 0/10. No gold stars. Not even a clap on the back for a job well done or a shrug for a good attempt..| NO.| Yes.| No.| yes.| This was the largest issue I saw. The instructor was poorly organized and made poor choices with the mediums he used to teach. He frequently used a smart-board program so that he could write his slides, however his drawings and penmanship in these portions are illegible and were often irrelevant. For example, the professor once spent 8 minutes drawing a diagram of an example problem that was going to appear on the next slide. The professor does not make effective use of his equipment or time..| Yes they were. Even though it was off topic the teacher would show the class funny pictures during our ""break"" and they were so funny I really enjoyed that part of the class..| Lecture slides were very helpful. They were extremely organized and clear..| yes.| Decently, they could use some work to make them flow better though..| not at all.| Yes and no. Because we spent so much time on the early ""easy"" chapters, so we could not spend that much on the last few chapters. I would suggest doing the opposite. He/you spent so much time teaching (statics) on the first 2-3 weeks. He/you don't need to spend 2-3 weeks teaching (Statics) on a Mechanics of Materials class..| For the most part, he went by the book..| yes they were..| Overall the course was fairly well organized, while some of the courses could have been structured better..| Yes.| not at all. jumped all over the place hard to follow.| Not really, sometimes spent time looking for problems to do, and spent too much time on problem and was unable to finish it..| Yes, covered both theory and plenty of examples..| Not at all. He seemed completely unprepared most of his lectures. I never saw him have lecture notes, frequently got confused and lost on example problems. I think he just thought he could wing each class just because he had the slides provided by the book..| I believe that they were well organized. He would come in with a clear goal for the day and he would make sure that we stayed on course to learn everything needed to succeed..| Yes..| ........| I feel like he needs to come to class better prepared. Maybe use the computer less for examples as it becomes very jumbled very quickly..| He improved over the semester but I feel he can still be more organized..| YES.| The lectures were not terribly well organized. I felt for the beginning of the semester he did not have a very detailed lesson plan, and did not have problems worked out before class..| The lectures and content were organized..| Somewhat.| Course content was good. Lectures were often got off track with random tangents though..| They could have been coordinated better, but it wasn't bad..| no they were all over the place and seemed like he didn't have a plan before coming to class. jumped around way to much and was had to fallow..| The course content and lectures were not well organized. He would go back and forth between the board and the slide show. Then he would start a problem on the slide show, go through part of it, stop, turn off the projector, put up the screen (which took a lot of time) and either start the problem over again on the board OR start a new problem altogether. He also just used the slideshow the book provided which basically repeats the same content and pictures as the book. It probably would have been more effective just to read the book instead of attending lecture. Homework seemed to be an afterthought. At one point he gave us a homework that was due two days later because of a test the following week and he had forgotten to post the assignment. Most students in the class felt that they didn't have enough time to do the work properly because they had to squeeze it into their schedules; whereas, when given a week to complete homework, the student can plan ahead to when they can get it done amongst the assignments and exams in other classes and if they run out of time it is their own fault. He gave out midterm evaluations, and what we told him there was to pick either the whiteboard or the powerpoint, but not to switch between the two, to stop wasting class time on rambling and tangents. The following class period he spent the first twenty minutes reading all of our responses to us. He wasted time telling us we told him to not waste time...irony? After the midterm evaluations the class didn't change at all. I don't know why he bothered to give it to us. My suggestion would be, since he had the lectures recorded, to have another professor or two (considered good professors by students) watch one or two of his lectures at random (some lectures were better than others) and give him feedback..| No, I dont think there was ever much of a plan and he seemed to lose his train of thought often.| not really.| Pretty well.  We fell a little behind the schedule at times..| Sometimes, there were a few times where we would go completely to a different topic in the middle of another one..| Yes",2015 Fall
652,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 7,"Never sought the instructor outside of class..| good.| yes.| Yes..| Offered many times for recitation and office hours.| I did not require much. Was there for occasional quick question after class.| Yes.| I think so.| Did not use office hours, so I wouldnt know..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes..| I did not need to use office hours or other kinds of outside meetings..| Yes..| Yes.| yes..| Didn't bother contacting the professor out of class, if I had questions it was easier to ask friends and get a group answer of what we thought was expected of us and what was wanted than to worry about trying to contact the professor..| Who knows.| Yes.| Yes.| yes.| The instructor posted his recorded lectures on line, which when played at 1.5 or double speed sounded like he was talking normally. This was an especially helpful resource that I utilized extensively as he tended to speak painfully slowly..| Yes always available.| Although he had to travel for conferences for multiple times, he was available all the time through his email..| He was very responsive..| yes he did he was good about that.| Yes, he was always available and responsive during office hours and appointments..| Yes.| yes he was..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes, always willing to meet and provide additional help..| Yes, he was very helpful in his office hours and he would always email back usually within the hour to any questions that I had..| Yes..| ........| I can't comment on this because I did not meet with him outside of class..| The instructor was reasonably available and responsive..| Unknown, I never contacted him outside of class.| Yes, he was available for appointment..| yes.| yes.| I never tried.| yes.| Yes..| Yes he was!.| Yes",2015 Fall
653,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 8,"good.| I think that he should be evaluated. His test scores may not be bad, but if you show up and write some equations you will get a C. I feel like this whole semester was a waste of my time. I wish that I would have had a professor that was prepared for each class. We were way behind the syllabus then he thinks it is okay to have us read an ENTIRE chapter on our own so he can get to the next topics. I do not think this is right, I do not think that I have learned everything that the course requires. He would also put up quizzes online then email us that they are up. Sometimes by the time I would get that email the time would already be past that it was due. If people tell me that he is the teacher for this class next semester I am going to tell them that they should wait until they can take someone else..| Thanks for a good semester..| No.| NIce guy, bad professor..| No.| The class got behind from the start which caused us to rush very quickly through important material. The instructor was also not very easy to understand in the way he presented the material..| Make the class more fun. Make it more interactive to keep the students engaged..| He was not very good at teaching. I think Mian should teach how Scott Thomas teaches. Do not worry too mush about the theory or derivations (we can read about those in the textbook), just go over a lot of examples all the way through..| After doing an evaluation during the middle of the semester, it improved, but overall he is scatter-brained and does not present material in a clear manner..| No.| we didn't get nearly as far as we should have. grading was very fair though..| Will attempt to never have another class with this professor again so that I can have a shot at actually learning the material.| Do not let this man teach again..| No.| For the love of all that is holy, if you truly want students to ever learn anything stay as far away from a classroom as you can for the rest of your life..| No.| The instructor uses PowerPoint slides provided by the same people who make our textbook. This is extremely frustrating and sometimes leads me to believe that our instructor is seeing his slides for the first time the same time we are. I realize this is something teachers are allowed to do, however this style of teaching makes me wonder what role exactly the instructor plays in our education..| Good teacher and I hope to get a good grade in the class. The final was hard though..| Dr. Mian recorded every lecture, and put them on pilot as a reference. That was very helpful. I wish every instructor does the same..| he is one of vaguest people I have ever met.| This instructor is one of the best instructors because he cares about his students, and willing to improve. In summary: 1- Prepare more for lecture 2- No need to spend 2-3 weeks teaching (Statics) on a Mechanics of Materials class. 3- Solving more problems on board is always a good option. Thank you..| no.| No,.| seemed like he had a crash course and then had to teach it to us. very difficult to follow..| He utilized the online learning service. Go take a look at his lectures, and you'll see what I mean. I found absolutely no merit to go to class..| He was a great teacher that really took the time to make sure that students understood the material..| No..| .....| Room 144 in Russ is the worst classroom on campus. It needs to be completely redone. Almost half the chairs are broken and the other half aren't far behind them..| I felt the instructor truly cared about his students learning, and I respect him for that. I felt his overall teaching style was not suited well for that class room, as he took time, multiple times each class, to raise and lower the screen to jump back and forth from the projector to hand writing on the board. His examples, even when they were straight from the book, were relatively unclear..| Maybe easier to keep the class involved if the notes were your own and not just the book notes because everyone already has the book and can read it..| No.| he is a very nice guy but not the best instructor.| Nope.| spend less time on review material, and move the course at a faster pace, find simpler ways to convey topics you seemed to over complicate it.| no.| Just try to explain how to use the material a little better.

I have take computational structural dynamics under him and this is the second subject for me..| Very effective..| Classes were not very beneficial to the students' understanding of the course material. Applying what we are learning to real events and real material was beneficial. Some organizational issues did make things difficult..| Not very effective, he seemed confused by the material and there was a lot of problems with clearly following along with what he is doing..| Poor quality teacher.| A very fair instructor, homework and tests were tough but reasonable.| He is very poor, I did not learn anything during his lectures.  When he would do examples in class, they were hard to follow. There was no structure/lesson plan for each day..| Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow, and explanations weren't always clear..| 2/10.| It was okay, the examples did help.  The book is great though..| The material could be explained a little better.| He's not a very good professor. He doesn't explain things well, gives homework that he doesn't know how to do and gives tests with crucial elements that have nothing to do with the course material or were never taught or gone over. Ex: we needed to use power equations on the first exam but no homework problem required them and i didn't have them on my formula sheet because there was no prior mention of them. This is not something I have memorized..| The deliver of the material was not as effective as hoped. The material delivery was some what scattered and was not ordered in the best way..| I am just satisfied..| The exams in class are extremely long for the 50 minutes provided. The graduates and the undergraduates take the same exam and there is no difference between the 4000 and 6000 level course except for a few homeworks..| The material was taught effectively..| Effectiveness was below averaged compared to other professors..| he was a good instructor and knew his topics well.| Zero Effectiveness. Assigns a Project to design gears shafts and bearings and  completely skips the chapter covering shafts because he was  running behind. Tests are worthless. I had a friend get a higher score on a calculation problem on the second midterm without using any numbers or calculations. My answer was mostly correct except I carried an error I made early in the problem throughout the entire problem. He took 13 weeks to grade the first quiz. I can honestly say I learned nothing from this professor. The MME department needs to watch the recorded lectures and see for themselves..| Absolutely terrible. He cannot teach.

664,ME 1040,Henry Young,Question 3,"Yes and gave time to start design task to ask questions that we had.| yes, he was able to manage time between his lectures and allowing students to have enough time to do as much work as they could for the class.| The class promptly started at 6:10 and lecture lasted until 7:30. After that open lab would last the rest of the slotted time to complete the handful of projects due..| Even though he rushed from a class he taught on the opposite side of campus, he was still on time each class and the time was spent well..| He was pushed for time because of his class right before ours, but that was not a problem. Our class was set up in such a way that he would lecture first and then give us the rest of the class as an open laboratory. You could utilize the full class period if you wanted to. The Ta's and Professor Young were always available during open lab to answer any design questions. The length of class period depended on three things 1.) the length of the lecture, 2.)  pop quizzes, and 3.) The student..| yes.| The instructor attended class as soon as he possibly could. Since he had a class right before he may have run a couple minutes late. However, he always tried to start class as close to on time as possible. The professor gave a lecture for a hour and also gave open lab time for the rest of the period..| Yes..| yes.| Used approximately one hour of instruction and one hour for class work..| Yes..| did not start on time ( but understandable, he was teaching another class and had to walk across campus to teach ours) but always used class time wisely.| Yes.| Yes class was started on time but we had open lad and was allowed to leave when we wanted to..| Class was almost always started on tine, class tine was always used completely..| Yes.| The professor spent the class time very effectively and efficiently..| Yes.| The class was supposed to be from 6:10 PM-8:40 PM and he would always start right at 6:10, and sometimes a little later to allow the late students to walk in and get their items set up. Depending on what was due that day or week, Dr. Young would explain the project in detail to convey to the students what was needed from them. If nothing big was due, then a short, interesting lecture would take place and the rest of the time would be given to the students as ""open lab"".| yes.| Yes he always started the class on time but if he finished his lecture early we had open lab and people were welcome to stay or leave the lab..| Yes, sometimes he was a couple minutes late but he had to rush from another class. The entire class period was not used to lecture, rather it always ended with open lab, as designed for this class..| the instructor would use the first hour of class to lecture and leave the rest of class time for students to work on projects while he and his TA's were available for questions until class ended.| Class was started on time. Any class time the instructor didn't use was deemed open lab..| The instructor would be late either getting to class or getting started in class and most of class was free time to do our projects that were due almost every week..| Yes.| yes he was always on time and made sure we used the full time sometimes went over a little to teach more..| Yes..| Dr. Young always started class on time and he used the first hour to hour and a half on lecture and teaching us solid works and the rest of the time was open lab. While this may seem like he gave more open lab than actual teaching, it is actually very effective because some students (like me) don't have solid works on there own computer, also this open lab time allows the students to work with the addition of being able to ask for help if they get stuck. So overall I would say that Dr. Young did use the whole class period..| Yes.| Dr. Young usually started on time but did not use the full class period for lecture. Time was allotted for students to work on computer aided design projects each class period..| yes.| He did you the whole class time and we started as soon as he got to the class..| Yes, however the final portion of the class was optional, although the instructor stayed for this entire time..| Yes, class was slightly different with an hour of lecture and then open lab, but he was always there to field questions throughout the entire period.| yes every single class was started right on time and went for the entire deration..| He was a minute or so late every day but it's because his schedule,  not his negligence. He was routine and proficient with the way his time was spent..| he started on time but gave us open lab after his lecture for the rest of class.| Would start on time, but the only half of class period was needed..| yes.| Yes..| Yes, he started class on time and used the class time for lecture and open lab. During open lab, the students could leave if they wanted to be it was not recommended.He stayed until the end of class every time..| Class was started on time and was never longer than it need to be.

It was hard to follow exactly what he was doing on the board sometimes because he was kind of all over the place and his notes/lectures were messy. We had to draw a lot of graphs and it was hard to keep up and follow along with him at times. You could either just listen to him and try to understand conceptually what he was saying, or just focus on recreating what he was drawing on the whiteboard in your notes but not really focus in on what he was saying. You couldn't really do both. Since the class consisted of making so many graphs/diagrams you would go back and look at your notes and see everything you had drawn but wouldn't have any notes to go along with them. Sure, it's  great to have a lot of graphs but if you don't know what they tell you they're useless.  If he organized his notes a little better it would be a much better course. Rather than perhaps just deliver his lecture on the whiteboard, pass out some worksheets beforehand that already have the graphs and figures that you're covering that day with space for notes. This way students can focus more on interpreting the graph and taking notes on what information you can get from it and what he is telling you about them, rather than spending a lot of time trying to make them look right..| I really enjoyed having Dr. Young teach this course and have a much better understanding of thermodynamics because of him.| Well done. I feel like this class was well worth it and effective..| no",2015 Fall
678,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"He was good..| I enjoyed real lectures as opposed to the new teaching style. The professor worked hard to get students to learn the material.| This instructor was not effective.  His teaching style was not conducive to learning, as students discussed topics with little to no input from the professor.  The professor was in the process of writing a text book, and it was still in the very rough stages.  There were little to no examples, and in many cases, he was trying to finish writing the chapter as we discussing the material..| very good.| concepts were explained well wherever the questions arised.",2015 Fall
679,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 2,"Yes.| yes..| No.  The instructor immediately got off the schedule listed in the syllabus.  The syllabus listed the class grade was going to be based on several quizzes and a group project.  Instead, there was no group project and he gave a take home final.  There was no direction, and when asked for more direction, he commented that it didn't matter because he ""would be very lenient with the grades."".| Yes.| yes",2015 Fall
680,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 3,"Yes.| Yes..| The class was not directed by the instructor, but the class typically started around class time.  Several classes the prof did not say a word, and the class just sat in silence, reading material..| Yes.| yes",2015 Fall
681,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 4,"He would always answer all questions that were brought up..| See 1.| I did not see evidence that the instructor had interest in my learning. In fact, on the last day of class, we had a test where he asked questions like nothing we had seen before.  We took the test individually and then as a class.  After discussing my questions for a while, as the prof sat in the corner saying nothing. Once class was over, he commented that we missing key points.  He missed a value teaching moment, as we (the class) did not learn what are mistakes were. Also, several times people in class asked if we could have a lecture instead of student led discussion.  He never wanted to lecture..| very good.| The whole concept of classroom learning took a different level with the introduction of annotations. Since it was a very concept the instructor did keep pushing all of us to annotate which did help everyone",2015 Fall

I wish that there would have been more lectures so he could go over example problems that were similar to the homework..| Not a huge fan of this teaching/learning style..| I would not recommend this class or this professor.  I was sorely disappointed in the class..| no.| Since it is a very new concept, it will take much more time for the students to adapt to it and get familiarized.

The various assignments due were not well defined and not clear what was expected..| great teacher.| Not a bad instructor, knowledgeable on materials. Some of the lectures are pointless. The lecture on Microsoft Word should not have happened. We are seniors, if we have not learn how to use Word by now we shouldn't be engineers.

Hard to know when to compete assignments because of this..| Great.| He forgot some things but overall questions were answered..| Not very effective, waste of time in class for the most part.| He often would forget to tell us something in class, and then would have to email us. Or, we would have to ask him later because he forgot to tell us in class. It was very unorganized and a lot of times we had no idea what we were supposed to be doing for our assignments unless we asked them in class..| Outside of the classroom he gave inconsistent responses.

691,ME 4910,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"good.| yes.| Nope.| A lot of the content in the lecture was common sense and was very boring. Most of the class would just do their own thing in lecture. The guest lectures provided good information. A lot of the stuff covered in class could be done in 3 lectures total. The first or second should be only about how to write a notebook properly.

735,ME 4730,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 2,"There was slight inconsistency/confusion concerning the syllabus. The quiz section led me to believe that the class would have a significant number of quizzes. However, we only had a quiz in the first week of class, testing us on our prior knowledge from ME 2700 - Structures and Properties of Materials I. I found this to be extremely unfair, to be graded on material that had been covered in previous classes, especially since several of the students in this particular class had taken this class several semesters (or years) ago. Our grades for this class should have been based solely on knowledge taught in this particular class, building on the material from previous classes..| Homework and exams were graded as expected.| expectations were not clear.| yes the syllabus clearly spelled out the expected material and how each portion would be weighted in the final grade scheme.| yes.| Yes, she did.",2015 Fall

737,ME 4730,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 4,"I did not feel that Dr. Mukhopadhyay put significant effort into teaching the students this subject. Her methods of teaching nearly turned me off towards Ceramics. I got the impression that she did not really understand the subject herself, or if she did, she was not able to communicate it to her students. What is really sad is that I know that this is not just the case with me. Before taking the class, I spoke to several of her previous students, including successful Wright State alumni, and they all had the same comments. None of them felt motivated to learn about ceramics after taking a class with her, which is frustrating since I know that it is a very important field in Materials Science. It is sad to see the negative effects she has had on so many of these students, who could have potentially gone on to contribute greatly to the advancement of ceramics in industry and research..| tried very hard to engage students and encourage in class participation in conceptual and problem solving situations.| presentations at the end of semester show interest.| The instructor demonstrated interest in our learning by actively engaging students in the class and encouraged students to utilize outside materials to reinforce material learned through the use of term papers.| she answered all questions promptly. she also did a good job of tying the information to our previous knowledge..| She encourages students to involve in class.",2015 Fall
738,ME 4730,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 5,"Sharmila Mukhopadhyay is NOT an effective communicator. She seems unfamiliar with computer tools, such as Pilot, and emailing students occasionally seems difficult to her. A frustrating part of her communication is how she caters to the graduate students taking the graduate level version of the class, rather than starting out teaching the basics so that the undergraduate students can understand. To make up for her lack of efficient communication, she tried to have students read all of the material and teach themselves, since she seemed incapable..| Occasionally unclear on when homework was assigned and due, but very forgiving of due dates in these cases.| not good. not bad..| The instructor was responsive and  easy to communicate with both inside and outside of the class.| good",2015 Fall
739,ME 4730,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 6,"Several of the slides she used, and had her name on, looked suspiciously familiar to other older slides found online while studying. As for the lectures, most of her lecture time was spent explaining why/in what case a concept, equation, or method would be used in research or industry, rather than actually teaching the subject. Basically, we came out of lectures with an idea of why we would be using these concepts, but have little to no understanding of the actually concept..| content was well organized, but there was a noticeable jump in difficulty of concepts through the last half of the semester.| slide show lectures were well organized. lectures without slide shows seemed poorly organized.| The course material was well organized into logical sections of the lecture material that progressively built from previous information..| yes.| I think that this course had this state.",2015 Fall

741,ME 4730,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 8,"Dr. Mukhopadhyay should stick to teaching graduate level courses since her inability to teach the basic subject to her students leads to more unnecessary time spent reading for the undergraduate students.

It was extremely frustrating to have to endure her teaching this semester.

750,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"Good instructor. Kind of crazy, but he was straight forward with everything that he stated. Probably the most ""effective"" engineering instructor as far direct understanding of real world engineering applications..| Very Effective..| Very great professor, helps alot in class and in office hours.| The instructor went through the material well..| good.| not effective on my learning of the subject.| He is a good instructor.| Talks about things not related to the subject and spends most of the time talking about them, when he talks about the subject, he just rushes through it. other than that, he's alright..| Great.| The class material in class had nothing to do with what was on exams.  He is a smart guy but he expects us to know everything and I think most students didn't and they struggled on the exams..| Professor Slater has a very difficult teaching style. He is very informative when discussing the material, however he tends to come across in a ""he knows better"" manner very aggressively..| Majority of learning done outside of class. He seems like he really wants his students to succeed, which is admirable; however, the implementation of the teaching was difficult to benefit from..| Very effective, knows how to relate to students and get them engaged in his course.  Clearly invested in his students..| Spend less time talking about irrelevant things and go over more examples. You said it yourself, you don't remember half the things you talk about the previous lectures. Neither do we..| He did very well at describing problems and walking us through them based on what was needed to be found..| Sometimes goes to quickly over examples, expects students to know what they should already know. Not a bad thing, but students can get confused in the beginning of an explanation and not understand anything the rest of the lecture. This can always be solved by asking questions, which he stressed endlessly the importance of asking questions. I think overall he was effective in his teaching, if the student desires to learn the material, which is the case for any class..| the course was useful. the instructor was very nice and helpful.| the exams are not similar to the homework.| bad.| did not explain how to solve problems very well, often generalized how to get to the solution. Class problems did not reflect the exams very well. didnt teach in every class.| Very effective he showed us how to start from the beginning and work through a problem more effectively..| Dr. Slater has a different teaching style than most professors. I feel that for me, his teaching in the lectures was not very effective. For the students who have excelled in their classes and do not need much outside help, Slater would be for them. The lectures were taught as if you knew the subject already and explanations for topics seemed hidden. Dr. Slater is far more effective after class (one on one) than a lecture based class. I was unable to make most of his office hours but when I did I learned far more in those 15 minutes than I did in any of his lectures..| Dr. Slater was over a pretty good teacher. Although it seemed like he really just wanted to show off how much he knew, he really cares about his students and tries hard to help them learn the material..| Good lectures, although the written notes were not as easy to follow..| Good.| Explained theory well but was extremely vague in how homework was to be completed..| The instructor was clearly knowledgeable on the topic and cared about students learning the material. Class was filled with appropriate and properly challenging examples that helped my understanding of the material. I feel like he was a good professor..| Good instructor but tricky tests.| His lectures were easy to understand for the most part. He was available via email and in person..| Very effective. Was available for consultation..| Dr. Slater was very effective given the short class period..| Effective but spent too much time on stories and experiences instead of material, had one too many pep talks when disappointed about exam scores.| Good instructor, need more explanation on some things..| Dr. Slater was available and easy to contact both through email and regular office hours.  I wish that more examples would have been solved in class since we sometimes were barely able to complete a single problem during a class period.  This was better during the later chapters for electrical circuits and fluid systems and had a good balance between teaching principles and actual example problems..| he dose not explain clear the material.| he tries really hard. he truly cares for the students and tries to encourage us as much as he can. he is really good helping students identify with him. But his classes are a little bit messy for me. got lost sometimes..| he was the kinda of teacher that will tell us that we need to know something but he never explain it to us, there was some lecture where he came and sit and just gave us something to work on which doesn't make sense. also he will explain alot of things in MATLAB but in the test its all hand solution..| Effective.",2015 Fall

757,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 8,"None for this instructor..| Nope..| He should give easier exams, curves the grades when the average is low.| No.| good.| no.| no.| Professor must count for the class time in exams (when 55 minutes!)  Also, most homework problems are not related to class and exam problems.| No.| I'm good.| No.| i hated this class because of the instructor..| no.| Nope.| System Dynamics covers a lot of material, so it is a difficult class to teach. A lot of subjects need to be perfected before taking this class. I do feel that Dr. Slater could have brought the class to speed quicker by a short review of the subjects we need for that certain chapter. Many of the important subjects at Wright State, such as statics and dynamics, are taught by professors that do not help you learn the subject. You are forced to learn how there test works rather than the subject itself. That is why a short review would benefit the class as a whole. Lecture time was not spent to help the majority of the class. A few students (In my class around 3) understood what questions Slater would bring up in class. He required to much knowledge of this class prior to his teaching. I feel that if the he would slightly take a step back and make sure the class as a whole were close to being on the same track, more students would show up to his lecture..| N/a.| No.| You should give this guy a raise. I quite enjoyed his class. I feel like I could have done better in his class but I'll accept responsibility for that. I should have worked harder on homework. If you don't believe a student wrote this (it does seem quite nice) you can ask me to verify. Assuming this is properly anonimized, I'm the workout buddy. He'll know who that is..| I hope I pass..| He should grade the homework like he does the exams. What is considered partial credit on homework was way different than on the exam. The homework should be a good idea of how well I will do on the exam to improve the homework grade to then know ill do good on the exam. He should write down notes of questions asked in class that need to be answered outside of class so he doesn't forget. A few times students asked questions he said he would answer and forget to get the answer and remember the next class he should of had the answer..| Expects a lot out of you and needs to focus more on how to apple concepts, homework was very tough.| Tough course, but material was well covered.| he is bad professor and he dose not now how to explain the material.| I dont think he is the one who should teach this class.| Some homework material was never covered in class, that would have helped the students. Other than that, the class was taught well and exams were fair.",2015 Fall
758,ME 7160,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"The instructor has a very broad understanding of the subject covered. This made for a smooth flow of class time. However, I feel that it also made it hard for the instructor to relate to students difficulty in grasping the topics covered..| Awsome professional teaching with new innovative way of explaination.| Good.| He is nice to the person who is well acknowledged with all the subjects which are interlinked to this subject like computational methods for structural dynamics, Mechanical Vibrations, Finite Element Applications, Optimization and also who are good at programming in Python, Mat lab etc. In personnel I can not able to understand his lecture even in a single class.  So, i think this subject if it has pre-requisites of all these subjects will be good to the students I can give 05/10 for his delivery of lecture to meet the student understandings.| Hard class, so obviously its not easy to keep up with the material when it is first given. I thought it the online notes as notebook files were a great way to understand everything that was presented. I felt that this course may need a few more prerequisites, Dr. Slater tended to assume I knew more than I did during lectures which I will admit is also something I should be able to catch up on in my own time. I frequently got lost in the lectures and couldn't even say where I was lost at.

765,ME 7160,Joseph Slater,Question 8,"Students who want to take this class in the future need to be explicitly informed that programming skills are a must if one hopes to pass the class. This in fact should be a prerequisite that is strictly adhered to. I was fortunate enough to have programming experience and conscious understanding that in order to solve problems posed in this class required numerical techniques..| No.| No.| 1. In each and every class the last 10 minutes, if the professor explains the information that has explained in the last 01 hour without any formula and with application (Animated video will be better) is the very good idea for understanding the lectures 2. From the first class, if the programming in the form of projects or home assignments is encouraged then excellency can be seen from many students 3. If there is any new terminology in his field, that should be detailed according to the students understanding 4. The outline of the entire semester course details, if he detailed in the starting of the semester for half an hour, will be productive in terms of understanding. These comments might be helpful for the understanding levels of upcoming students who haven't registered for the course work and also not shown interest. I am very sorry if there is any thing wrong comments made by myself. Thanks for the opportunity to provide the survey to be completed.| I think github has the potential to be a really good online environment for course materials. however, I spent more time than Id like to just figuring it all out.

766,ME 4430,J. Wolff,Question 1,"He is a good individual. He is a good professor. He just needs to work on coming to terms with how much work he expects out of his students. For a three hour technical elective course, I found myself easily putting in 10+ hours for some projects that did not equate to a portion of the course grade that they should have been. He makes sure you learn the material, but most is taught be going through the book piece by piece. Like I said, good professor, just really expects 120% out of his students no matter what the subject..| Good Instructor..| He is very Patient and answers all questions, though he teaches more towards the graduate students assuming everyone has already learned topics from the prerequisite classes he also teaches, that other professors may not have gone over. Would be useful to have more examples..| Dr. Wolff communicates very well, but his writing style on the whiteboard is somewhat disorganized.

For example, show the end result so that we know what we are looking for and then take us step by step on how to get there. Additionally, more examples of problems or more homework would have been helpful although the textbook used didn't exactly facilitate this. Moreover, more concise projects. It is understood by the students that the projects were a new idea to help us understand the material better, and the instructor listened to the students when they said they needed more time on the projects and was not against extending the time. The projects did help to the overall understanding of the material and were more effective in illustrating what was being taught to the students more that the homework was. The only suggestion for the projects is that they be weighted more in the overall grade or to make the work load less intensive. With this being said, the projects were very helpful in contributing to the overall understanding and they should be included in future teaching of this subject. Finally, it would be better if this intense course was held earlier in the day when the students aren't so sleepy..| Great professor His assignments are long and hard, but he fairly grade it..| Too much theory and equation deriving.

In addition, the literature review paper is a lot of work for 10% of the course grade and a limited amount of time to do it. These reviews are for thesis students that take 30 weeks to complete it, not 5. Plus there is a take home final, which with past experience I know will take more time than an in class final.

Granted this was the first time the course has been taught in probably at least 7 years, there were a few bumps along the way but the is to be expected for any class in this situation.  If any errors were made, Dr. Menart was sure to go back and correct them to ensure students had accurate information.  I think more time on the RHT may be beneficial (for example how we essentially used the Navier-Stokes equation throughout the entire semester of convective heat and mass transfer).  Other than that, coming up with more unique symbols for variables may be a good thing.  It was discussed that there are a large number of variables and sometimes symbols get repeated, even in the textbook.  For example, F is used for blackbody fractions and view factor both,  E was used for emissive power and a different term in the scattering and absorption coefficients for the RHT.  There are multiple other cases.  While you can eventually tell what the symbol means from the equation/context, I think its easier for students who are just learning the material if they have unique values.

That being said, I think I would have done better in the course if I showed up more often and did the homework sets as I was learning the material in class, instead of working though all of them the day before the exam to study.

I would recommend any student to Dr. Menart..| nope.| Nope..| No.| No,.| no.| He's a very good professor that cares about the knowledge that his students are receiving, and the information that he is presenting.

Great teacher..| One of the best instructors I've had thus far..| Dr. Menart is an extremely good teacher and has made my interest for thermodynamics increase. Coming in to the class I was unsure if I would enjoy the class or not, but he has made me really enjoy the subject and pursue it further..| Occasionally his notes get really sloppy..| No..| I would make homework worth 5 percentage points. I had no incentive to do the homework as the layout currently is. Even if the students will look up answers, at least it gets them to look at the homework. I would also have the pretest not worth any points on your grade. Some of the content was never touched in previous courses taken and I feel like I was punished because of it. The pretest should be used to gauge where students are at, not as easy points in my opinion. Other than those minor complaints, he did a great job teaching the course of thermodynamics..| Truly a passionate and great teacher.

It is refreshing to walk into a class and have such a clear idea of what the course will entail and what is expected of you as a student. I can say that such an experience has been a rarity among other engineering classes..| I should have gone for the renewable energy Masters. Prof. Menart is pretty excellent..| Dr. Menart was the best professor I have had at Wright State. Throughout my time at college, I had heard he was a good professor, but I never had the chance to sign up for one of his classes. I finally got that chance my last semester of school, and I was not disappointed. Thank you Dr. Menart..| no.| No.| Good instructor..| I think the class hour should be atleast 1.5 hours; it was just for an hour and so, he would take atleast 10 minutes to review the previous lecture and that was helpful but I felt like it took too much time and could cover very less materials for the day..| Dr. Menart is a great professor. He seems genuinely invested in the success of the students, and cares that they take something away from his class. This makes learning his material much easier..| Great job, though try to reorganize material slightly to get through more of it. We were many lectures behind by the end of the semester..| i like his class. he is a nice professor..| I hope he takes more classes in renewable and clean energy 7000 level courses, such as advanced thermodynamics 7500..| no.| The Instructor can add more practical aspects about the course..| I want to reiterate that I really enjoyed that the lectures were posted online, especially since this was an 8 am class and I work late nights. It was great to be able to watch them at will if I could not make it to class and to be able to go back over them while studying for test or completing homework. Dr. Menart was a great instructor and I feel like I learned a lot this semester. The test were very hard for me to achieve high marks on but it pushed me to try my best to really learn the material..| very good course and professor.| Dr. Menart is a great teacher. I would have to say hands down he was the best teacher that I have had here at Wright State. He is always helpful to students by posting notes and lectures online. His grading is fair.  The only negative that I can think of is that the first part of each test is a closed book, closed notes portion. Sometimes (not always) I feel like this is more of a trivia section than an engineering test. I also would have liked to see only material from the lecture or HW on the test. He would occasionally put in material from his own notes (which he does supply to us) but which I don't remember covering in the class period or on the HW.  Thanks Dr. Menart..| No",2016 Spring
846,ME 4700,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"e.| Fairly good..| Dr. Farajian was not the best professor I've had at Wright State. He seems to have little interest in his students' learning and doesn't receive (answer) questions well. My impression was that he is a little condescending and expects too much last-minute from his students..| He was there when consultation was needed as well as to answer questions.| Lectures were well spent..| Very effective, knew the material well..| Very clear explanations. Utilized the textbook to provide better understanding..| As far as the MME department, there are many areas for improvement both in administrative and academic roles. Dr. Farajian is one example. Dr. Farajian is the only professor that I know of that has taught this course. I have heard from MSE alumni that they have lost interest in the electrical properties of materials due to the fact that there is not a professor that has been able to teach the content effectively. Dr. Farajian should rethink his teaching methods and observe how the physics department teaches the introductory PHY 2410 Physics II course. A recitation component to this course would prove beneficial. Perhaps Dr. Farajian should consider only teaching graduate level courses due to the fact that he presents 25% of the information and leaves the other 75% to the student to figure out. Additionally, if the overall performance of the class is poor, that should directly reflect on the instructor's teaching ability. If teaching ability and class performance were satisfactory, this would negate the need for extra credit assignments. It appears that Dr. Farajian is more concerned with his research and professional image than WSU's most important objective: providing a world class education. It is for these reasons that I will pursue a career in metallurgy instead of electrical, thermal, optical, or magnetic materials science disciplines.",2016 Spring
847,ME 4700,Amir Farajian,Question 2,"e.| Yes.| Dr. Farajian evaluated the (2) exams, term paper, and presentation for this course, but we have only received one exam grade, so it is difficult to say that he really evaluated my work according to the syllabus. The assignments throughout the course did not match up with the syllabus. The grading according to the syllabus was as follows: ""Grading: Homework 20%, Term paper: 20%, Midterm Exam: 30%, Final Exam: 30% (Final exam is not accumulative)."" However, we had extra quizzes and a presentation that were not clearly accounted for in the grade, so I am not sure what weight either of those had in deciding my grade. Additionally, the final exam did draw on concepts from the beginning of the semester (Exam 1 material), and required equations from the previous test.  I was also very disappointed that a main concept that was supposed to be taught during this course (Magnetic Properties of Materials) was completely skipped. This was one of the 5 main concepts that were supposed to be taught over the course of this semester..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, he was fair..| Yes, evaluation was based on expected criterion provided in the syllabus..| Grades are determined by homework, the midterm exam, the term paper, and will be based on the final exam; however, Dr. Farajian did not include how he was going to grade unannounced ""quizzes"" or a final presentation. The syllabus divides the final grade into the following: Homework 20%, Term paper: 20%, Midterm Exam: 30%, Final Exam: 30% (Final exam is not accumulative). Nowhere does it mention how quizzes or a presentation will be weighed in grade calculation. If an assignment is going to occur, make sure that it is clearly defined in all parts of the syllabus on the first day of class. The term paper guidelines were never clearly established as being a summary of current findings in research or as a literature survey. It should be noted that in the syllabus it states that magnetic properties of materials will be covered, but the topic was never addressed. The homework grader was inconsistent on grading when students used the exact same method to solve problems yet received varying grades.",2016 Spring

Welcomed questions..| Group discussion was a major aspect of generating interest among students and it worked really well.| Dr. Farajian failed to demonstrate interest in my learning due to his condescending demeanor towards undergraduate students.

I wish he had done more practice problems in class, or at least gave practical application cases..| yes.| Yes.| Yes..| Yes.| The lectures were structured on the fly. His lectures followed the textbook, but he failed to give cohesive examples and simply copied equations from the book without fully explaining how the science reached aforementioned equation.

The instructor clearly likes the subject.  Because the material builds on itself so much it takes half of the term to really start seeing how this approach can be useful.  A bit more foreshadowing of how Chapter 1 leads to Chapter 5 would probably pay off.   The in-class groups at first looked like they might take away valuable class time that could have been used to learn more material.

886,ME 4240,Junghsen Lieh,Question 1,"On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give the instructor a 9.

He has a sound command over the course material and has this knowledge to the fullest..| good.| alright.| All we learned was matlab and the instructor just gave us packets to copy for matlab.| very ineffective, learned hardly anything.| q.| Dr. Lieh was very effective..| Good.| eh!.| Negligible. Tries to explain things but when you voice that you don't understand a subject matter, he repeats what he just said.... But louder. You quickly learn to stay silent in your lack of understanding or to nod your head yes when asked if you understand because someone else in the class will be able to explain it better and more clearly to you later. Fellow students were more understanding and patient teachers of the subject that Lieh was..| Dr. Lieh has a particular teaching style that is very ineffective.  He knows the material very well and I assume that he believes it to be easy.  Because of this, he rarely took the time to actually teach us anything.  He consistently had us copy MATLAB and Simulink codes and programs that he never fully explained, and then believed that we were to understand it purely based off of copying it down as quickly as we could.  When we weren't copying code, we were basically looking at graphs and equations that were never fully explained, and then it was back to copying code.  I basically learned very little in this class and I couldn't actually prove to anyone that I learned anything.  I understand there is a language barrier, but he also has the tendency to get louder if you express that you don't understand something.  He does not attempt to explain it in a different way, he just increases his volume until the students, including me, would just say that they understood in order to make him stop shouting.  He is a very nice person, and he is funny and interesting as well, but this class needs a serious overhaul if Wright State wishes for its engineers to be properly trained in ""Vehicle Engineering."".| ok.| very good.| good.| the instructor needs to explain the material more deeply instead of going over it quickly and have us copy codes into MATLAB without telling us what each things does or why it's used..| THE INSTRUCTOR IS VERY ENERGETIC AND MADE ME PAY ATTENTION TO HIM ALL THE TIME..| The professor was unable to get information to students effectively..| Makes me want to kill myself.

Negligible communication effectiveness. Out-of-class? N/A. I learned not to try..| In the classroom it was terrible.  His communication style is completely ineffective.  He rambled a lot without actually teaching us anything.  Outside of the classroom, it was also ineffective.  He refuses to use pilot so never knew what our grades were.  We could email him about the grades if we wanted, but we never got anything handed back in class.  I got one grade report the entire semester.

893,ME 4240,Junghsen Lieh,Question 8,"I feel the instructor should change the method of his evaluation because the class for this course consists of both under-graduates and graduates. Judging them both on a common ground level is unfair according to me. Also, I feel he should use Pilot more often because I didn't see him utilize this tool for this course. We had to e-mail every in-class exercise to the teaching assistant. If he can just ask to submit our work on some kind of 'Dropbox' on Pilot, that would be great. Printing out this many handouts is surely a huge wastage of paper when he has the resources to go green..| good.| no.| no.| Class time was poorly spent, nothing was learned in this course. Projects were difficult due to lack of material in class..| q.| nope.| No..| i can tell he has way too many things on his plate! please drop some off of him so he can teach better.| Someone needs to start sitting in on some of these classes at Wright State.  This school is being hurt by teachers who have fallen into a tenure slump and care more about research and publishing papers than anything else.  This class was a total waste of my time..| no.| no.| no.| use pilot to upload grades and handouts.| NO.| System should be required to take this class. The content of this class is essentially an easier for of systems but with poor explanation..| Fire this guy please.| Overall a good class and professor.| No.| no.| I'll enjoy his teaching and class will be active..| no.| No.| No..| I thought these lectures were too rushed, with the emphasis on busy work rather than learning..| Thanks.| Mention that this course uses Matlab and simulink in the course description. Also, because of the Simulink aspect of this course, and the assumption made by the Professor that you understand simulink, there should be a course beforehand that covers this. Dr. Lieh mentioned that Simulink was covered in Matlab (Just took it a few semesters ago, was never taught in the course) and that you also do it in system dynamics, which I have not taken. If knowledge of Simulink for this course is required, why was it NOT disclosed by the university. This has been one of the biggest failures of a course I have taken at Wright State. I really hope the university will look over this course and its requirements, and institute pre-reqs as necessary. Dr. Lieh cannot teach Simulink, you MUST understand it before taking this course. Being a huge car guy, and wanting to be a design engineer for the automotive industry I thought this would be a good course. Overall it was not an effective use of my time and money..| no..| No.| none.| NO.| No.| no.| Its really great class for my major. Its help me a lot for that..| no. professor is good.| Good professor.",2016 Spring
894,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"Engages the students within class very well, great lecturer.| not bad.| Great.| Horrible. He spent most lectures talking about how he wouldn't want to teach and so he would just tell us to do an example problem that not explained how to do..| The professor's teaching could be more effective. Not enough time spent on solving examples from the book. More time spent in MATLAB would be nice too..| Slater is a good professor.  Often, he would give a very simple example and then expect us to do a very complicated problem by ourselves with only the very simple example to go off of.  The problem would be that we would have no idea how to do the problem and would spend most of the class being clueless.  Other than those instances, his teaching is very effective..| Good, really tried to engage with the class and make it interesting. Made it way easier to try and pay attention to a subject that I found some difficulties with..| Not good. Have to learn on your own.| bad.| Not good, there was no instruction. Class time was spent telling us the things we should already know, and then the next lecture he would breeze over things saying, ""we covered this last lecture"". He was never straight forward with the things we should know and never finished any examples he started, which then made figuring out what he wanted on quizzes a pain. I dont think he really looked at any of the homework he assigned because he never seemed to know how to solve it..| Very effective..| actual application related to the ultimate education purpose..| Very effective.| Once we got into the core content of the course he became an effective instructor, however, in the first couple weeks when he wasn't teaching us ""new information"" he tended to waste class time. This is ok for those who have a solid grasp on the previous courses, but for those who could have used more of a refresher it was an inconvenience. As someone who teeters in-between I would like to see more information presented about the topics involved in thermo-fluid flow and how they affect systems..| I'm a big fan of Slater personality wise.  He's top 3 professors I've had at Wright State but this class requires so much explanation and clarification it's hard for anyone to really teach..| Not sure that I would call it effective..| Slater was very effective. He engaged the class and did a good job making the material clear, answered questions well, and kept a lighthearted attitude throughout the semester which made the class enjoyable as well as productive..| This teacher is very effective at conveying material in understandable English. However, he could've been more effective if he provided answers to in-class problems, and solutions to homeworks..| His teaching style was OK with me. He needs to provide tutoring or recitation to students..| Dr. Slater does an excellent job of simplifying complicated material in an easy to understand manner. He keeps students interested during lecture by using his sense of humor..| good.| I thought the instructor was fairly effective when he tried to be. He did a better job than most in terms of keeping the class's attention. I thought he could have given more complicated examples in class. He seemed to give the simplest example and expect the rest to be learned outside of class..| Was more effective in small groups like the office hours or personal meetings..| The professor was very helpful. He made a point to be available for office hours as much as possible, even taking time to answer questions via email when not in office hours. Explained dynamics well enough that I left with a better understanding than after I took the actual dynamics class. His teaching simplified what otherwise would have been a very difficult course. His teaching style was entertaining enough so that I did not have too much trouble paying attention..| The overall effectiveness of Dr. Slater is very good. I learned a lot in class, although the homework was sometimes a little long..| He was entertaining and covered a lot of information.| I do not believe the instructor was effective at all. His teaching style was sporadic and he never really seemed to have a defined process for the course..| Explained topics well, always gave clear answers to questions, and knows how to keep students interested..| He shows the key points of System Dynamics and the most necessary content..| Dr. Slater was effective, examples were relevant and homework was appropriate and helped with the understanding of the class as a whole.  His teaching style was what I prefer, a traditional lecture style class with guidance through relevant examples. One of the more effective professors I have had during my time at Wright State. Dr. Slater was more than willing to help in office hours..| Very Knowledgeable, great professor!.| I felt as though Dr. Slater did not teach this class well. He often times would show us the simple steps of something and immediately jump to complicated problem and expect us to know how to solve it..| good.| Great personality, however as a professor, I believe he should care more about if the students actually understand the material rather than just advising them to go to office hours with a large crowd..| Effective.",2016 Spring
895,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 2,"yes.| YES.| Yes.| Sure..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes.| no.| no.| No, grading was incredibly inconsistent, and there was never a set syllabus so no one ever knew what to study..| Yes..| Yes.| Yes.| I thought it was realistic. I don't understand the usefulness of professionalism points..| Yes, he was true to his syllabus..| He didn't even know what he was doing half the time..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes..| yes.| Yes.| Yes, his evaluation of my work and the syllabus lined up very well..| Im not sure how he even breaks up the syllabus and the grading.| That is hard to say since the syllabus is not well defined itself, when you create a category called ""quizzes and final exam"" and make that category worth 80% he can literally do whatever he choices with our grades and we have no idea where we stand..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes..| The expectations were not well laid out for this class in my opinion.

He would often say, ""I don't have time to do this problem in class. Come see me in my office hours."" which is fair to those who could make his office hours, however, I'm convinced more problems could be done if their was less story time. Not that the stories weren't interesting....| yes..| Yes. Now the real question is that if we used the class time properly. Dr. Slater comes in and says ""I dont feel like working today"". So he puts a ridiculous problem up on the board. Takes us 99% of class just o scratch the surface. Then final 5 minutes of class, he solves it and the whole time we didn't learn anything because he fails to teach..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes..| yes.| Yes. Never once cancelled class and never ended too early..| Yes, class started on time and ended on time..| Yes he did.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes..| yes.| yes, never late and used the whole period.| yes..| Correct",2016 Spring
897,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 4,"absolutely, he encourages all students to come to office hours and to stay in communication with him any time help is needed..| HE ASKED US TO COME TO OFFFICE HOURS.| Well.| No..| Very but the professor needs a TA to help distribute the load because there are not enough resources for all of the students questions.| His policy on coming to office hours after not doing so well on a quiz ensured that those who needed help got it.  I think that's a useful tool..| Very engaging, required meetings after getting 6 or less on a 10 point quiz so he could see us personally and help work out where we were having problems. Really cared about our success in the class.| he didnt.| badly.| He didn't. He was kind of a jackass in class, constantly trying to make jokes that just ended up annoying people. And his ego was insufferable, mostly because he wasn't able to back it up..| He always related the class content to real work situations..| He brought some real example of theory or concept..| He would make jokes to keep us interested..| Yes, he seemed genuinely concerned that each one of his students gained an understanding of the subject and how it applied to real-life engineering principles..| He kept things interesting for sure.  Made lots of jokes and tried to relate class material to real life work situations..| He forced us to learn the material by ourselves in which he is paid to teach. He is a waste of the university's money. We are forced to learn the material and if we learn it wrong, which is 99% of the time due to difficult material, then we are screwed.| One thing that Slater did that none of my other professors have done was make office hours mandatory if you didn't do well on a quiz. I got a very low score on my first quiz, and went in to see him. He pointed out what I was doing wrong and had me redo the question in his office, allowing me to fix my own mistakes and learn through experience rather than simply have the right answer explained to me. Very helpful..| He encouraged us to come to his office hours, and was fairly helpful and approachable in them..| He show some videos and explained a lot about the applications that are related to my in-class materials.| Dr. Slater required students to go to office our if students did poorly on a previous quiz. There he could help reinforce the lecture material as well as get to know each student..| by teaching.| He insisted on the students meeting with the instructor outside of class in order to correct any learning gaps if the student received a poor grade on a quiz..| When you did poorly on a quiz, he had you schedule a personal meeting to go over the mistakes with you..| He made a point to respond to all emails I sent him as soon as possible..| He demonstrated great interest in my learning of the material and was very willing to meet out of class and discuss any issues..| He was interesting.| He tried to make us come see him when we did poorly on his quizzes but even then he was not consistent with that process..| Made time to help students outside of class and even office hours..| He says always that he helps everyone in the office hours but he is more focused on checking his emails than helping..| He was knowledgeable in the subject and often gave real world examples while working through the math/theory of problems..| He often talked down to us and was quite rude to students..| yes.| Telling jokes and referring problems to real life situations..| Highly concerned with our success.",2016 Spring
898,ME 3210,Joseph Slater,Question 5,"extremely effectively.| Way Better than any of my other professors. He strongly strongly recommends office hours..| When he decided to teach was fine but when he decided not to the class was awful..| Communicated well. Good descriptions of the topics..| Pretty well..| Seemingly forgot to do things once class ending (such as emailing the class the simulink model worked on in class together) if not given reminders but always available for consultation within reason by setting up meetings times. Tried very hard to pick office hours that worked for most the class.| good.| Very poorly..| He communicated very effectively..| It was perfect.He has been available even out of office hours and schedule..| Very effective.| He did a good job of communicating through email. One suggestion, it would be helpful to post a link to your blog with the homework assignments in Pilot to act as a shortcut. This is what other professors who prefer to use their own private page have done and makes accessing homework much faster than Google-ing his name every time..| He was available for help outside of class and did a good job trying to teach material in class..| When i do see him he can answer everything and anything not pertinent to class or homework. As soon as I try to get him back on track to help further my understanding of a subject or homework, he doesn't give a clear explanation or he changes the topic. Its like he doesn't know the material well enough to teach..| Fairly effectively. Sometimes Slater would put a bunch of information up on the board and then have the class do a practice problem blind, without seeing a demonstration first. This worked most of the time, and the information tended to stick better because we ""taught the material to ourselves"" rather than just copying it during a lecture. The one exception to this was the section on motors, we were taught in this manner but I don't think I really learned the material that time..| He communicated well - until he got off topic..| Average.| Dr. Slater was almost always available for question whether through office hours or email..| well.| The instructor communicated relatively well. Again, he is a skilled professor, who I thought did not go far enough on examples in class..| Communication was good.| Explained most things in class very well, although a few things in the homework he never mentioned in class. For these problems, however, he would work through the problems in office hours if asked..| Very well. He is very busy, but he made time to meet and to respond to emails quickly..| very effectively.| He was a good at communicating.| Gave examples of topics and answered emails within 24 hours.| If someone speaks with him he puts out his cellphone and check his emails in the meanwhile. Very disrespectful..| Great..| It usually would take large amount of time to reply to emails but often very vague in replies. Also he always had office hours but it seemed whenever I would bring a problem I need help on I'd leave more confused or with no answer at all..| almost too much so..| If you had a question whether in class or out of class he would answer them as quickly as possible..| well",2016 Spring

Additionally, he needs to return homework to students before each quiz because students cannot study for the quiz without homework solution.| yes.| yes.| Yes..| They were fairly organized.| Yes. Never went too far off schedule compared to most other classes..| Yes, although some of the quizzes were a little off based on what had previously been covered..| Yes.| No to the best of the instructors abilities.| Yes.| He is the only professor at Wright State who doesn't update/state the homework problems in time. It is a joke that he updates the homework problems within 48 hours before due date. This happend throughout the semester and he encouraged students to start ""early"" with the homework problems. Several students did wrong homework problems and struggled to do the homework and to finish it in time. To answer the question of a student ""how should we prepare for the quizzes"", he said ""that we have to nail the homework"". How should we nail the homework when the homework gets updated/stated at the very last second. It is hard to learn the material because the homework problems get updated that late. This problem can be changed very easily. Very unprofessional his organizational behavior..| yes..| No, he would often come in and tell us that he didn't feel like writing today. Felt also that more time was spent telling us stories that were not productive or meant to impress us..| yes.| I believe so..| yes",2016 Spring

We would lose points on our homework, but never see the correct solution. All I learned in this course was I am doing things incorrectly, and never actually learned the correct way of doing things. Yes the book helps a little, but when he tells us to do it a different way than the book, then we do it wrong and never see the correct answer how are we supposed to learn? This course needs more feedback, a better defined grading system, a place we can go and view our grades, and a better set of lecture notes..| Yes.| In general, a good professor if we don't look at his organizational skills..| no, great experience!.| This class was by far the worst class I have experienced during my college experience. I felt as though Dr. Slater made this class much more difficult then it should be with lack of examples, explanation, and homework with material not taught. Also there was a large portion of the class that relied on using Matlab and functions he did not teach and that we were  expected to use on quizzes in class. I left class almost everyday feeling demoralized and talked down to and not as though I had made any progress in the my knowledge of the subject..| I just wish I could have had a better learning experience in this class. I didn't learn from a scheduled pop quiz. I believe exams throughout the semester gives the students a better understanding on the material they need to learn and pick up on any material their slacking on. One exam for the entire semester, is a bit extreme and stressful. I feel like this course is easier than what was taught, I just never understood where I stand in the class.

In class there could have been more examples, but he was very open to hearing those comments from the students throughout the semester to be able to change that for the future..| In the classroom, Dr. Slater was very difficult to follow because of the many in-depth derivations that were performed and the fact that the notation that was used in the book was very difficult to follow from chapter to chapter. I had a very tough time following the flow of everything and seeing the big picture because we rarely saw it applied to an actual vibration testing problem.",2016 Spring
907,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 6,"Not really. More waving of hands and writing on the board would have been nice. Reading from his unfinished manuscript was difficult to concentrate on. It was nice that the manuscript was provided free of charge..| The content flowed very smoothly. More examples in or out of class would be beneficial. Supplementary material on the Vibration Testing toolbox would be helpful as well in order to learn how to properly use it..| Yes they were.  It was a little rough with the book, but that is because it is still being worked on.  It will be a lot better once he has more examples in there..| Everything was well organized. It could have been slowed down a little bit, though.",2016 Spring

910,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 1,"meh.| good.| Dr. mian is a very smart individual, but he is not very good at explaining the step by step process into what he is doing for us. He is however good at explaining the theory. Please work on more examples and not making them so complicated..| Teaching was effective but a little erratic at times..| Great.| Dr. Mian was good at explaining the key content of this course..| He was an okay instructor.  Was hard to stay engaged in the lectures, as they jumped all over the place..| average.| Somewhat effective, he seemed to crawl during the first couple weeks of class and then went really fast to try and catch himself up. We didn't get through everything we needed to get through and I can't say I know everything I need to know to move on. What he taught us in the beginning of the semester stuck well I think because he wasn't rushing to get through stuff. Towards the end we were going much faster and I got lost somewhere along the way..| He is very effective.  He describes the material in detail and walks us through examples..| Best instructor in wright state.| Class time was well spent. Worked over example problems to teach the material. It worked..| somewhat effective.| Dr. Mian was incredibly ineffective.  I understand that he was brought on to integrate additive manufacturing into the Wright State Engineering program, but having him as a professor does this school a great disservice.  His inability to effectively pass on information was mostly due to disorganization and what I assume is a lack of comfort with the material itself.  He consistently could not solve or finish a single problem within a class period, and that was partly due to the fact that he was obviously unprepared for the course.  Had he actually worked out the problems before class and had them written down, he might have been able to act like he knew how to solve the problems.  And maybe he does know how, and he was just nervous in front of students, but either way he needs to come to class prepared so that he isn't constantly making mistakes and constantly taking too long on the problems.  It is very difficult to learn from someone when they make so many mistakes because I have to constantly train myself to forget the wrong thing that he just told me, and I learn not to trust him.  I ultimately didn't learn much more from this class than I did in Statics and Structures and Properties of Materials.  I will almost definitely be disadvantaged in my future courses, and possibly future career, because of how poorly Dr. Mian presented this information..| He may know his material, but he could use some more practice or structure when teaching it. It felt like we went over topics very slow occasionally and we worked on problems in class that wouldnt be practical to have on an exam due to them being too lengthy..| perfect.| very good.| Very good.| I feel like he really didn't teach well at all. He would cover examples in class but rarely did he work the problems out ahead of time and then he would end up getting lost half way through the problem and tell the class to take a minute break. Also, there was one class session when students asked him to work out to problems from the previous homework assignment and he couldn't complete either question during class time..| Goodg.| effective.| good.| good teaching.| very effective.| Cool dude, kinda looks like a brown danny devito and I love it..| He is great.| I learned quite well from him. I liked his teaching method, which was to explain through examples and explain theory as we were working examples..| Very effective.| no.| Was pretty clear and teaching the material but at times he seemed lost in his own problems and couldn't figure out the answer.| Good.| good instructor..| I thought that Dr Mian was a very helpful and effective instructor.  He worked through many different problems with the class and explained them as we went along..| He is very fair instructor..| Not very effective. All over the place with his examples. He is a nice guy but I had to do almost all of my learning outside of class. And I'm worried how it will effect my higher level classes..| Very unorganized and seemed to always be manic..| Very effective..| Great at explaining things.| Spent a lot of time on single subjects but rushed through the harder stuff.

Some theory was present, more would be appreciated..| asking questions, giving class time to think about exercises.| I think Dr. Mian is a good instructor. That being said, he didn't seem to peak my interest in learning the subject. There were no significant interesting points which could have made the learning process more fun..| He would ask often if we understood..| yes.| He was very enthusiastic and interesting. He usually made sure we all knew what was going on. I could tell he wanted us to learn the stuff, not just pass the class. Having said that my statement for question 1 still stands. He rushed towards the end and sacrifices had to be made in the interest of time..| He answered questions about homework problems, even if they weren't due yet..| He always keeps the class interesting.| By asking us what we thought about the homework..| yes.| Dr. Mian is a very nice person, and I feel that he actually desires for his students to learn, but he is incapable of helping us do it..| yes.| great.| very well.| Good.| Yes.| Good.| nicely.| good.| yes.| x.| In a Danny Devito way, like when he played the penguin on batman.| It was good.| Made sure any and all questions were answered and gave 30 second breaks to allow us to more closely examine the problem to see if we understood it..| Passionate about his subject.| By explaining problems and where these problems are used in life.| good.| The instructor would ask several times per class if we were understanding everything and make sure we were following along with what he was doing.| He gives a Good examples.| Answered questions often and asked if anyone had questions often..| Yes.| Always answered questions.

I very rarely knew what he was trying to say and he consistently contradicted himself.  Questions were not helpful as he does not know the material well enough to explain anything on topic..| yes he did.

915,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 6,"yes.| yes.| We got behind early in the semester and he struggled to catch up, so we were rushed for the last half of the semester..| Scheduled quizzes were sometimes erratic. Lecture content was well organized and proceeded numerically but more review would be appreciated at chapter ends and more relations from chapter to chapter would help solidify learning..| Yes.| Yes, the content in this course was organized in the most effective way..| No.  He would start a problem and then not finish it.  Would stop in the middle of a problem to take attendance or pass back test.  Overall I don't think he was well organized..| not at all.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, they were..| As organized as they needed to be..| kind of.| Very disorganized.  I feel at some point, if he is willing to put effort into the class, he can at least reach a point where he seems like he knows the material purely because he will be copying his notes..| yes except for the first month of clas.| yes.| yes.| Yes.| There was one week where we covered a single problem over the course of three different lectures and that's all we finished. It was not a very difficult problem either, he was just extremely slow and didn't work anything out ahead of time..| Yes.| Goood.| yes.| good.| yes.| yes.| Yes.| For the most part. The course started off slow and never really picked up pace. Some example problems in class didn't appear to be worked out before hand which caught him by surprise and took longer than he thought.

I really liked him and would absolutely take him again..| Best instructor in wight state. I would definitely take a class with him in the future..| Wright State's Engineering program has no hope of ever advancing or becoming more respected as long as the department is making poor ""big picture"" choices, such as trying to integrate additive manufacturing by what I assume was offering tenure to an incompetent professor.  Now we will have an additive manufacturing program that helps a few students pigeon-hole themselves into a very narrow and basically worthless program, as any engineer will be able to work in the additive manufacturing sector without a specific additive manufacturing degree, and we will also have the added disadvantage of hundreds of students who will be improperly prepared for the work force due to a professor that contractually cannot be fired.  This sort of myopia will surely tarnish any reputation that an engineering degree from Wright State will have in the future..| I feel like if you have an exam average over 95% leading up to the final you shouldnt have to take it, Or figure out a way to still take a test on the material, but not have it effect your grade..| no.| no.| Thank you.| I feel like I am going to retain borderline nothing from this class because he did such a poor job. I am most likely going to get an A in the class, but I am terrified for future courses where this is a pre-req because I am going to have next to no idea what is going on. The instructor is a very nice guy, but I feel like he doesn't know the material well and probably shouldn't be teaching this class..| What a good professor.| Good.| good.| no.| no.| No thnx.| I liked the class and liked the professor. Just needed to adjust how much time was allotted per subject and work example before so any surprises weren't discovered in class. Learned a lot in class..| No.| No.| no.| Nice guy. Just needs to get better at going through examples in class. He is all over the place while doing his math.  I, personally, feel like I would have benefited more from receiving an equation list as well. Myself and others noted that we were never really given a group of base equations to use. Granted I'm sure we got them all at some point in the semester just spread out over time. But I think that would've helped with everyone's understanding..| I feel that I didnt learn enough in this course to justify the cost. I wish I had known about the teacher before hand and took it with a more competent teacher..| Dr. Mian was great..| I wish we had spent the 3 weeks on statics at the begining of the semester on the actual course content.",2016 Spring

When he was effective he is engaging and knows the material..| He was really effective during lectures. He would often lecture, then have us practice the concept in class and then repeat. I felt like this helped in my learning.| he was okay but with the new way of teaching could be better..| Average.| He wasn't very effective. I didn't learn very much. You didn't need to actually learn the material in order to get a good grade. Perusall is what I'm referring to specifically. It didn't require you to actually know the subject..| Difficult to learn from this instructor..| Time was spent poorly at beginning as expected with this style of class but then he started doing lectures and exercises in class which made the course much more effective..| 6/10. 10 being the best. I do not learn a lot from this type of class( a lot of round table class). I don't know because it is new or something, I don't feel like learning a lot when I go to class..| I learned a lot from this instructor..| he is a great teacher but I didn't learn anything from the scale up class setting, not his fault though..| Did okay for the class style.| The instructor was somewhat effective. His powerpoint slides were helpful..| This course was very interesting and the methods of teaching that the teacher used was great and more effective than any course I have taken..| great, very clear and covers every misunderstanding that students may have.| Bad.| Good.| Instructor was pretty effective in the education process..| Instructor is very effective. Very knowledgeable, provided many clear and applicable examples..| The lectures from the Professor contributed greatly to my understanding of the course material..| Knows material and is good when he lectures. Class setup does not help in learning the material..| he is a good in structure.| He knows what he is talking about. Being that this was his first time doing scale up, i believe he can fix a few things..| The instructor was very knowledgeable of the material, but the way the class was set up, it was very difficult to learn the material.  I had to learn most of the material by myself which make coming to class pointless..| he was okay.| good.| Dr. Srinivasan was very effective. His lectures were very clear and emphasized the more important information. He was open to non-standard teaching methods which in my experience were more effective in allowing the students to learn the material. Examples of this are how during lecture he highlighted areas from the assigned readings that students had questions about, and he reviewed the homework assignments as opposed to just grading and returning them..| The instructor was fantastic..| He is very smart but I struggled to understand certain concepts..| yes",2016 Spring
951,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 2,"Yes he did and because this was a new teaching style he was very clear on what he wanted from the class..| Yes the work was evaluated based on expectations described..| Yes. Also, he treated as better than i assumed..| Yes.| yes, there were very detailed expectations on how the work would be graded..| The course did not fully follow the syllabus that was laid out in the beginning. The course relied on students engaging with each other in order to work out problems, but if the group does not cooperate then that eliminates the relevance of the course. The course was moving to slowly for the amount of information that was to be covered so some of the information was left out in order to cover the important concepts..| yes, he stuck to the syllabus overall. Any deviation was to the students benefit..| yes.| Yes.| Yes.| sort of.| Yes seemed to follow it exactly..| yes.| yes.| Yes.| yes.| Yes..| Yes he did.| yes.| Yes.| Good.| Work was evaluate as described.| Yes..| The instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus..| yes.| yes he did.| Yes. However, the annotations were very difficult to remember and worth 25% of the final class grade which makes a huge impact when one or two are forgotten here and there..| yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes. My only complaint is that the scoring for the reading assignments was accomplished via a computer program as opposed to a grader reading the annotations. Good annotations would be graded poorly because they did not contain keywords the program was looking for. This led to the reading assignments being more about writing annotations that the program would grade well as opposed to writing them to convey the student's understanding of the material..| yes, he did his best to evaluate our work as described in the syllabus and tried not to deviate from it much..| Yes he did..| yes",2016 Spring
952,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 3,"Yes he did, sometimes he went over the full class period, other times he ended early it just depended on what he was lecturing on that day..| Yes class began and ended in the allotted time period. Yes class time was generally fully used..| yes, he used all the class time. Also, he gave us a lot of time to work to gather as group..| Yes.| yes..| The instructor was periodically fifteen minuets early in order t set up the class room when the students arrived..| every day.| yes.| Sure.| Sometimes.| yes.| Yes to both.| yes.| yes.| Yes.| yes.| Class was always started on time and the full class period was always used..| Yes.| yes, indeed.| Yes.| Good.| Full class period was used to the optimal amount.| Yes..| The class always started on time and the entire period was utilized..| Always.| yes he did.| yes..| yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes..| yes. he was always on time and ended on schedule..| Yes.| yes",2016 Spring
953,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 4,He brought in models and explained things very clearly and used demonstrations..| The instructor showed interest by asking each student what they may be having trouble understanding and was more than glad to assist them in improving that understanding..| He let me to work with other students and he did teach me hoe to work in a group which is my first time experience for me..| Yes.| routine lectures broken up with class projects..| He encouraged the groups to work together and asked questions when he was lecturing..| By having us annotate the textbook outside of the class..| yes.| Not at all.| Most of the class wasn't very interesting..| He didn't really demonstrate any interest in my learning..| He gave us a project at the end to apply some of the things we learned to an actual superhero weapon..| a lot.| by having a guest speaker come into class to describe his job and show us what the content looks like in the field..| yes.| trying to figure out what we didn't know.| He explained things when people had questions or reviewed material that students didnt understand..| The method of annotations was great it gave me the opportunity to read the book and demonstrate what I learned and make comments and answering others question..| he did a good job on that.| Not interested.| Good.| Instructor demonstrated learning through the use of real world scenarios.| Always walked around to make sure we were focused on discussion of the material. Would answer most questions from Perusall..| The professor would find questions from students from book annotations and explain them in class..| very good.| He walked around during class to make sure i understood what was going on which was very helpful..| yes.| i dont know.| He actively communicated with the students in order to gain understanding of their level of comprehension of the material..| he was very hands on with our learning and interested in making sure we achieved what we wanted to get from the course..| Class discussion.,2016 Spring
954,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 5,"In the classroom he was very responsive, sometimes he was lacking on responding in an orderly manner with e-mail. But he would approach you in lecture to answer your questions given in an e-mail..| communication was very good everything that was important or coming up if it was not announced in class an email was sent containing the information..| He was very good in communicating with the syudent both in and out of the classroom..| Yes.| effectively. there were no problems communicating with the instructor..| If questions were asked he would answer them, and he would answer emails quickly..| Extremely well. He would email the class about anything he deemed important. He also emailed me back quickly if i emailed him about any concerns i had..| was okay could of been better.| Average.| Decently well. I wish he posted the homeworks earlier than he did..| allright.| Good.| 6/10 .10 being the best. I think you have to do some sort of penalty if student on their phone playing games or go on social media because they got distract from those electronic devices..| really effective because he was always available when asked if you could meet..| very well.| fairly well.| He communicated well inside and out of class..| During office hour and by emails that he replies always..| he is always available in office hours, email, by the end of each class and even he spend some time with student after class room in the hall ways to assist any concept covered in class.| Good.| Good.| Inside the Classroom: Instructor was ready and available to answer any questions given. Outside the Classroom: Instructor would answer questions by mean of Perusall which when answered seemed to be useful.| Very effectively. Always kept students up to date..| The professor answered questions thoroughly during class and would provide answers to questions online..| excellent.| Very well, both in and out of the classroom..| very well.| good, responded to emails promptly.| Very well..| very well..| He would email us about changes in the syllabus if need be.",2016 Spring
955,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"Yes he explained what he wanted to when he wanted to, and kept up with the syllabus..| Yes for the most part the schedule had to be changed and the lectured different from day to day on how they were presented..| Yes they were..| Yes.| no, the structure of the class was impossible to follow, and there were very few in depth lectures, this inhibited my understanding of much of the material..| when he would lecture the information would only cover the topics that were most confusing to the students in the class. If a single student was confused about a different topic the question would not be answered. So I'm certain that many questions would go unanswered..| Yes, he uploaded all his notes and powerpoint slides to pilot so everyone can follow him during lecture. Then he would add annotations to his own powerpoint slides and reupload them,.| yes.| Not at all, part way through the semester, we did a complete change in how the class worked.| Decently enough for a firs attempt at this style of teaching..| no.| Yes.| somewhat.| Yes for the most part..| yes.| yes.| Everything was organized through perusall..| Yes.| yes in some places.| No.| Good.| Lectures were well organized and followed the book fairly well.| I didn't care for the way the course was layed out. It felt like we spent longer times on each topic and retained less info than a traditional lecture. I didn't care for Perusall as I found it buggier, clunkier, and just an overall worse experience than a standard paper textbook. I don't think this was the fault of the instructor and instead is more to do with the Scale Up layout. The instructor did keep all the content on Pilot very well organized and easily accessible..| The course content was well organized and all lectures were provided online..| I think this course needs to be more lecture and less project based/ hands on to effectively learn the material..| yes.| Not so much. I think it is because this was his first scale up class. I think now he has a better idea of how to run the class and organize the material to mesh better with the different learning environment..| semi.| yes.| no in the beginning, yes towards the end..| Yes..| yes they were.| He lectured or we did group work.",2016 Spring

957,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"He is a wonderful professor and an intelligent man..| I think the instructor was very good on the basis of knowledge and ability to present the knowledge but with this being the first time he had taught the course in this scale-up style i think it hindered some of his abilities. I have some mixed feeling about the way the class was handled i liked the way you was required to read the information on your own and the way everything was graded was fine, but i like the traditional way lecture goes better than just discussing what we read during class or working through problems..| No.| This new way of teaching structures in properties was a unique experience, however it was very difficult to learn in the environment, if i wanted to annotate a book i would have done an independent study....| The instructor is knowledgeable about the information he was teaching. But the way the class was laid out was rather detrimental to his ability to teach because not every student was on the same page in the class and he had to assume when he was teaching the material he had to assume that every student was on the same page. The concept in the class was a good premise but was not executed well because we were placed in groups but the group portion of the class was very small except for a single project and some quiz's. Overall I learned in the class but I have not learned everything that was supposed to be learned in this course..| Amazing professor, Love the teaching style..| perusall did not help me learn in any way i did not like being forced to have a digital copy of the book  i'm a person that like to have the book makes much easier to find stuff and flip between pages. the grading on perusall is not right i should be able to see what i'm doing right or what i'm doing wrong.  never use perusall again this is an engineering class and not some English class!!!!.| Terrible class.| This style of teaching is ridiculous. This learn it yourself and come into class to review concept doesn't work for me in any way. It didn't help that Perusall didn't really require us to know what we're reading. This upscale teaching method, or whatever you actually call it, really just means teach yourself. If I wanted to teach it to myself I would've just bought the book and not bothered paying someone to not teach me. Instead I payed for someone to tell me to teach myself and grade me on whether or not I succeeded. Seems very backwards and not effective. This is the second upscale class I've taken and I refuse to take another one. Both of which ended up with me teaching myself. Absolute waste of time. Having said all that I liked my professor this go around. He was very knowledgeable and organized. With this being his first crack at the upscale teaching I think he did a great job, but again I don't like this method. It's nothing against him, it's just that this way of teaching doesn't work..| no.| No.| Weird class setup but taught in an effective way.| no.| difficult class style because i was taught to learn my whole life differently.| This class does  not need to flipped. I did not learn very much at all  from this style. Half the grade is from homework that no one knows how to do and annotations that are easy to manipulate. This class could be okay flipped if the instructor could use the technology better. He struggled for weeks with clickers and attendance. The class isnt terrible but needs lots of improvements..| I hope many professors use his method because cor me it is effective..| No.| Good.| Overall professor Srinivasan did an excellent job with the course, however I feel it would be more beneficial to do a few more lectures at the beginning of the year..| I don't think that Scale Up is an effective tool for teaching engineering courses. I feel that the instructor and the class would've been more effective if it was in a traditional lecture format. All Scale Up really did was create unnecessary outside of class work that really didn't help me in my understanding of the course. Despite Scale Up being advertised as not being death by homework, I had more take home work in this class than any other engineering class that I've taken. I'd rather have exams as they do a better job of letting me know what I understand and what I need to improve on. In all I think Scale Up should be kept to gen eds and majors where it might be found more helpful, but not engineering..| None..| no, everything is good.| He is a good professor, most likely going to get a bad reputation because of the inorganized set up..| I do not like how this class was structured; Dr. Srini tried a new teaching style for this class, and i do not think that S&P was a good choice of that. I think this class is a bit too difficult for students to be expected to learn all the material and get used to a new teaching style where basically we had to teach ourselves and if there were questions that we COULD NOT answer, then we could ask him or one of the TA's. If this class were instead, intro to reading books or something easy like that, then I think this structure would be OK to try. Not in S&P. Thanks..| no",2016 Spring

Led to a very unorganized class and undefined requirements..| q.| The lecture he did do was alright.| Bland..| not too good.| Very unorganized. I had to constantly remind or bug him to put up the rubric and template for our final report.

Poor organization.| yes.| Yes, everything was outlined in the syllabus,.| Yes, was very fair..| not good.| no.| yes.| Average! but he must not judge people based on their origin or must not treat students differently on any base.

Taper this back..| q.| No.| no but don't let him teach the class.| Overall, I think the class should be used more for the actual Capstone project and less for guest speakers. It is very unorganized sometimes and can really get frustrating when you ask the professor a question that he cannot answer and then takes 2+ weeks to get back to you with an answer. Trying to be proactive and get things done early for this class is almost impossible because they wait until the last minute to tell you what you need..| not good.| no.| yes.| Again, I literally hated taking this class with him because I strongly felt that there are many other aspects that I had to deal with other than the academic ones!.| YES.| no.| He is very smart..| no",2016 Spring

989,ME 1040,Craig Baudendistel,Question 8,"Amazing teacher, hope to have for future courses..| I would recommend this class under Dr. Baudendistel to anyone who has an interest in the material. Fantastic instructor!.| Loads a lot of work on at a time..| no.| My only suggestion is to be less lenient on the students. As a student who always submits quality work on time and completely, it's irritating to see other students get leeway when they aren't careful about their work or submissions. You defined due dates and the required material very clearly and you shouldn't give out passes because students refuse to read thoroughly. Additionally, if they weren't sure what you wanted, they should contact you. Also, the practical portion of the first exam was way more work than could have reasonably been completed. I find it ridiculous and a little insulting that one of the UTA graders said they completed it in 40 minutes. Maybe make it more clear that you uploaded previous exam material for student to study. Thanks for a great semester!.| Give him an award !.| he was an amazing teacher and was a lot of fun to have.| Just a really great professor and very easy to learn from and to understand all the topics he was teaching..| No.| Overall, he was a smart, neat, and nice guy who taught us relevant information for our majors..| No.| very professional enjoyed the class.| none..| no.| Excellent Instructor, that I went out of my way to get for the Spring 2018 semester.| Dr. B is an exceptional professor. He was very kind and understanding when many of the students were struggling to learn Solidworks at the start of the semester. Although he does not know everything about Solidworks, he took great lengths to learn more about the program to pass more techniques on to us. Overall, great professor, very involved, and I will definitely recommend him to anyone considering taking his class..| He assigns ridiculous amounts of work, and students to do have the skills to complete it.",2017 Fall
990,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 1,"The instructor is very effective at teaching this class..| The material was taught well and was effectively taught. The class taught some really good applications for use within the field..| He was good at explaining things, but the class time was very short and the lecture type discussions we had were done while everyone was standing and not many notes were able to be taken. Other than the limited class time, the instructor did a good job at answering and responding to questions, and was prompt about refilling supplies as they were depleted..| Very effective and engaging when explaining lab methods and safety.| Dr. Young is an excellent instructor, covering what needs to be done clearly and concisely, and explaining in depth why the students are taking the actions they need to take..| He is a great teacher who understands what he is doing. His ability to explain engineering concepts is quite impressive..| Very good. Explained what was necessary for the labs..| Very good at teaching the material and providing good insight into the theory, (helped a lot with ME2700!!)..| He is a great professor and does a great job explaining what needs to be done..| Very effective.| no",2017 Fall
991,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 2,"Yes, although the class seems like it is the ""red headed stepchild"" of the materials path, and it has not been updated or changed much in a very long time so the labs are a little out-dated or different from what is asked of you..| Well, currently there are no grades whatsoever for any of the work we have completed, so I'm not sure how well the work has been evaluated..| Yes, the syllabus was accurate in explaining the expectations..| yes, grading followed the syllabus.| Unable to answer as of yet. We haven't received grades back yet, but I feel confident that he will do so..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes",2017 Fall
992,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 3,"Yes..| For the most part. He gave us a lot of time in class to work on the labs in class, and anytime that he did use for class was for very good teachings on how to use the machines and or complete the labs..| The class was started on time most of the time, and very rarely used the entire class time..| no, but this was due to the lab nature of the class so it was still very effective; we could use extra class time for lab work.| Class time was somewhat amorphous, due to being a rather free-form lab class on our own schedules. If he needed to cover topics with us, he would take the time in the scheduled time slot to speak with the class. Otherwise, the time was ours to work as we needed to in the lab..| Yes.| Not always. We often got time to work on our labs. Typical class time was about an hour..| Yes.| Yes, he made use of all the time.| Yes",2017 Fall
993,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 4,"Yes, he has a passion for materials science and metallography..| The labs and class were very interesting! It made it very fun to complete and l enjoyed them..| He made sure we knew what we were doing and answered all of our questions well..| consistently asking if we had questions about labs, giving thorough explanations, was very available through email or in his office.| Dr. Young would would explain the what and why of the labs, and was more than willing to answer questions. He would occasionally ask how things were going if we ran into each other in the lab during the week..| He demonstrated passion and humor to the class and was always happy to help for the sake of our learning..| He would help whenever he could and often offered advice as how to accomplish a certain aspect of the lab..| Showing us the results of the lab and what we could expect.  Good incentive/motivation for doing the labs as best as possible..| he was very interested in what we needed help with and was always there to answer questions. He always gave clear and concise instructions..| Yes",2017 Fall
994,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 5,"The instructor communicated very well in and out of the classroom..| Very well! He responded to emails fairly quickly and when he was in office he would respond to any questions..| In the classroom the communication was very good. Out of class, his communication was not as fast as it was in the classroom, but that is to be expected..| very effective communication both through email and in class.| Classroom communication was clear, concise, and efficient. Outside of class didn't need to happen that much, but a mass email got what he needed to say across just fine..| Very well.| Very well in the classroom. Email would take him some time to respond back. But when he did, the answers were very helpful..| Good both in and out..| He did a very good job explaining what he wanted from us and what he expected the final outcome to be. He was always willing to answer questions and responds promptly to emails..| Very Well",2017 Fall
995,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 6,"The course outline and ""lectures"" were fine, but not exactly what is in the syllabus or in the labs.  I believe this is due to the class never having enough time to actually do all of the labs, so they usually omit one, which leads to confusion when this professor decides to do the last two at the same time..| Somewhat, some times he was scattered throughout, but it wasn't always..| Not really, but they were not hard to follow either. The classes were more of a on-the-go environment, talking about things and issues as they came about..| for the most part; however the first two labs seemed to take way too long and the last two were rushed. The first lab understandably took longer because there were more new things to learn, but we did not need as much time for the second lab as we were given and it ended up rushing the last two labs quite a bit..| Organization was rather freeform, as the course is mostly student-driven in that the instructor gives the project requirements, explains how you might fulfill them, and then turns the students loose to actually do the work. Whenever there was something that needed to be lectured, though, Dr. Young knew what needed to be said..| There was no lecture, but rather an open lab..| Yes..| Yes.| yes.| Yes",2017 Fall
996,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 7,"Yes/.| Yes..| Yes, in my experiences he was.| yes.| Dr Young was hard to get a hold of in person, as he had his own work he was doing most of the time. He was quick to respond to emails, though, with one time in which he responded to an email within an hour and a half on a Sunday night in the middle of the Thanksgiving Break..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes.| yes, he was usually in his office and was always willing and happy to help us if problems arose..| yes",2017 Fall
997,ME 2600,Henry Young,Question 8,"While I understand that experience doing all 4 labs as well as doing the ""fun"" lab, #4, to assign both at the same time with only two weeks left in class, or two class periods total, as well as the large reports that are due with them, seemed very rushed.  Neither lab got the attention it probably deserved and the results of both could have been more in depth if they were done separately. Doing an additional lab, which requires a lot of polishing and mounting and microscopy is not ""fun"" when you also have another huge project due at the same time..| Dr. Young was an excellent instructor and I enjoyed the course very much..| I really enjoyed the class, however it was a lot of outside work and consumed a lot of my time during the week in order to keep up with all the work. I think that for a 1 credit hour class, it was a little too much work, and think it wouldn't be a bad idea to increase the amount of hours the class was worth. Also, the labs weren't very well spread out as we have both two lab reports as well as a lab due for this class for finals week alone. Otherwise, the class was very enjoyable..| Overall this was an extremely helpful class as far as reinforcing learning concepts from ME2700 and learning new lab techniques to put on a resume. However, the end of the semester was very stressful since grades for the first two labs were still not available for review up til the last week of the lecture, and 60% of the total grade was due during finals week. It would be very helpful to get the first lab report back, graded and with comments, before the second lab writeup is due so that we could know how well we were doing with our lab report writing. It would also be helpful for the pacing to be a little more even..| An excellent professor, and a pleasure to work with. I hope that we might be able to work together once again in the future..| He is an awesome teacher who does an amazing job. We all had a great semester with him..| The professor is great, this is a great class, but it's not worth one credit hour. The amount of work we have to do outside of class is not worth the one credit hour. It should be, at minimum, two credit hours as we are to do so much of the labs outside of class..| no",2017 Fall
998,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 1,"Very effective.| For his first time teaching this course in a while, I would say it went well..| This professor did well in trying to explain material and using up the entire class period. However, most of the classes seemed to involve derivations instead of how to apply the concepts to real world problems or example problems. Therefore, a lot of his classes seemed more confusing than helpful. Furthermore, he did not seem prepared for lectures sometimes, that were shown by making math errors consistently throughout the semester. Overall, he is a good instructor and willing to help..| well.| Dr. Young is a very good instructor. He presents the theory in a way that students will understand, and provides example problems to reinforce the theory. The only complaint is how scatter-brained his lectures can get..| Not very effective. Always messed up on examples and spent too much time fixing them in class..| Mildly effective.| 10/10.| excellent.| Very effective instructor! Teaches clearly and thoroughly..| Dr. Young was a good professor but he has some flaws that affect his effectiveness in the classroom. I will go into more details about these flaws in other sections of this evaluation..| Decent instructor overall, covers a good balance between theory and examples of the information..| Overall, he gave a good explanation of the subject and worked to answer any questions students had. He even would remember to talk about it the next class if he didn't know the answer that class..| good.| Henry Young is somewhat effective. The reason I say somewhat is because he get the theory and the example problems on the board wrong so things just get even more confusing. I give him the benefit of the doubt since he has not taught this class for a while. He truly does care about his students though..| Half the time he was pretty effective and the other half he even seemed confused by what he was saying.| Dr. Young's teaching style meshed with how I learn best, so in that sense he was an effective instructor. The balance of theory and example problems was good enough for me..| Not very effective.| Professor has a good heart and bless it, he tries.  He tries to do examples and things in class to get his point across.  The problem is, he is SO unorganized.  He loses his place, makes many errors in front of the class, has to stand there for many minutes at a time trying to regroup himself and figure out where he is.   But hey, he hasn't given up and he usually tries to clear up his mistakes.  Fair grader..| Very good professor, we all enjoyed the class..| Works out problems that you would actually see on exams in class..| The instructor is very effective at teaching mechanics of materials, and shows a large interest in the subject as well as teaching it..| The instructor presented the content clearly, defined and explained the theory well and gave ample relevant examples. However there were some occasions where the lectures moved too slowly. Overall quite effective..| Very scatter-brained..| He was very effective in the class..| He was a pretty good professor overall. Probably 3.5/5, would not mind taking again..| Although a bit unorganized at times, he explains things very well and the train of thought can be very easy to follow..| I enjoyed Dr. Young's teaching. He always taught with energy and I think that it made the material more enjoyable. He did make mistakes in his math sometimes but he always worked to correct them..| Somewhat effective. He gave good examples in class and was always willing to answer questions, but he frequently seemed unprepared for the lecture. A few times it seemed like he'd never looked at the notes for that day..| The teacher really cares about the students and them comprehending the material. With that being said, the teacher sometimes gets off track in his own work and makes many mistakes while doing problems on the board, he does catch and fix them and gives you great feedback on what he expects from you as a student in his class.| Dr. Young was fairly effective. The lectures were sometimes confusing because he said he hadn't taught the class in a while. At one point we spent two lectures on one problem because he wasn't sure of his notes. I'm not saying it was terrible at all, but a lot of us were confused frequently..| Dr. Young was very effective in class; he explained everything thoroughly throughout the semester. He often made mistakes during lecture, but these errors had little to no effect on my understanding of the course material, and he was able to correct himself most of the time..| Dr. Young was fairly effective. I thought he spent too much time working through the theory and derivation of equations making it less effective..| He is a decent professor, pretty laid back.| Clear in his speech. Can be scrambled or appear jumbled when solving a problem..| Dr. Young is a very effective instructor. He explains things very well and helps anyone who has questions..| Very effective.| great.| Pretty effective.| Good teacher willing to help students out even when he makes mistakes..| At the beginning of the class, he seemed well put together and organized. He got to the point and taught well. At the end of the semester; however, he was very disorganized, and his lessons are filled with mistakes and errors. This results in standardized equations being copied down incorrectly by students..| Was not very effective for this course. I have heard he is better at other courses..| Sometimes a bit messy, but always tries his best to make everything clear and understandable for every student.",2017 Fall
999,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 2,"Yes.| Do not spring a project on students that is not explicitly mentioned in the syllabus. I know it falls under in class activities, but with the other workload from classes, adding something like that at the end of the semester without mentioning it prior is not appropriate. It was a good activity, but I think it should have been mentioned more in depth earlier on. Students have a lot of other work..| Yes, the professor graded us by all of the standards listed in the syllabus. He gave us deadlines and dates for all of the projects, exams and homework..| yes.| Yes.| yes..| Somewhat. A group project was given for the last two weeks of class, without being told in advance. There was a unused 10% of the grade in the syllabus listed as ""in-class activities and quizzes"" which we were never given. This 10% was used for the surprise group project. This project was also in assigned groups, making it very hard to coordinate with group members during the busiest time of the semester when insufficient class time was given to complete this project. Of the two project choices, the content of one was being taught until the second to last class, leaving the students with insufficient knowledge of the subject for in class group work time..| 10/10.| yes.| Yes..| Yes, he was straightforward in his expectations in his syllabus and he graded based on that..| Yes, very fair and honest instructor. More professors should follow his example..| Yes he did..| yes.| Yes he did..| Yes for the most part, however he did say at the beginning of the semester he would give out about 5 pop quizzes throughout the semester and never ended up doing so. Instead he decided to have us do a group project within the last few weeks of the semester. I would’ve rather he been upfront about what we would be graded on so I could’ve planned accordingly..| Yes, work was evaluated as expected..| Yes.| yes..| yes.| Yes..| Yes, the instructor does a very good job of evaluating  your work based on the expectations he lays out..| Yes, instructor closely followed syllabus with small alterations based to keep pace with the semester..| Yes, mostly. The in-class activity was thrown in right at the end of the semester..| yes.| I don't have a huge problem with his grading. Exam problems seemed to be graded a little too harshly, but the curves and easy homework points helped make up for it..| Grading criteria was clear throughout the class..| Yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes..| For the most part; however, at the beginning of the semester, we were told that we would be graded on our attendance by having random pop quizzes. He never gave us a single quiz in class. To make up for this, he decided to give us an in-class group design project which would take place of the attendance grade. He did not tell us about this project until mid-November. We were supposed to get 30 minutes on Wednesdays and Fridays to work on this assignment, but almost every time we would only be given about 10-15 minutes. Along with this, he did not teach us the material that was needed for this project until about a week and a half before it was due. This gave us only two (partial) class periods to actually work on the project. As a result, most of this last minute ""in-class"" project had to be done outside of class..| Yes, Dr. Young followed the course syllabus exactly..| Yes he did.| Yes, fair evaluator..| Yes..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, the only complaint I have is the lack of explanation of the grades on the midterms. On several problems the only explanation was because he took off that many points for everyone..| Yes - there were no surprises. Dr. Young was very clear with his course expectations..| Exams were rough and graded inconsistently in my opinion..| Although the Syllabus is short, you always know what the next lesson will be about.",2017 Fall

With this he would save class time and confuse students less..| lecture could have been slightly more organized.| The course content was very well organized. The lectures were well organized..| Very well organized.| Somewhat. Wasn't very prepared for class. Often times didn't understand own lecture notes or would incorrectly copy information from notes to board. Wasted time and made lectures confusing..| 8/10 Sometimes lectures were a little all over the place or had a few continuity errors. Other than that the lectures were good.| yes.| No.| Yes, but really more time is needed to go over the material better..| Here is where his flaws are. I do not feel like the lecture was well organized. There were some lectures where he was very scatterbrained and we would spend an entire class working one problem and not even finish it because he would constantly make mistakes. I would not be so upset about the mistakes if it wasn't for the fact that he had the solutions in his hand and still made a lot of mistakes. Some of the mistakes he wouldn't catch until he was at the end of the problem and his calculations wouldn't be matching up. There was one week we spent all 3 days of class going over one problem because he would continually make mistakes. I really wish he would have uploaded his lectures on pilot so that maybe we could have followed along with his and possibly catch his mistakes as he makes them..| Somewhat, others were more or less so. The more prepared he came the better the class was..| Yes, everything was well organized..| yes.| For the most part. I did not care that it took two classes just to solve one problem. I would have also liked to see a little less theory and more examples. The class was about 65% theory and 35% problems..| Course content was well organized on pilot. Lectures felt haphazard a lot of the time and not practiced..| The course was well organized throughout the semester. On a day-to-day basis, some lectures seemed underprepared for (maybe 1/5) which could lead to some confusion on my end..| Not very organized.| no..| yes.| Somewhat, the lectures can vary in organization..| Yes, with the exception of the ""final project"" which was only revealed in the last few weeks of class and seemed very rushed..| Course contact was well organized. The instructors notes may not have. There were a few difficulties and mishaps with working from notes. This was at times distracting and potentially confusing..| not really - seemed to jump around a lot. Wish there was more examples rather than so much theory worked out in class..| yes.| He seems a little scatterbrained sometimes. Sometimes struggled to follow his examples from his notes. In this regard, he could have been more prepared for lectures..| very well..| Yes.| While the content was organized, the lectures frequently felt all over the place or incredibly confusing. Sometimes, it seemed he hadn't looked at the lecture notes before..| yes.| Lectures were at times unorganized and left us confused, but I'd say 85% of the time they were organized..| For the most part. He was a little scatterbrained at times, but overall he did a good job staying on track..| Yes, they were well organized for the most part. Sometimes, Dr. Young would get lost in the solutions or take up three class periods to explain on point when I could read it or find the equation in the book and have a solid understanding of the concept within 30 minutes versus 2h40m..| Yes, and no. Some days it would be organized and other days he would have no idea what was going on.| could stand more organization..| Yes..| Yes.| yes.| Mainly.| The content was explained well.  The lectures were explained well but if it were more organized it could have been more understandable..| No they were not..| I found providing multiple ways to solve problems spanning over several days to be a bit confusing - but that's partially due to the short class time.  I also believe that providing the equation first, then describing the theory behind it may be clearer. I personally write every thing down during each lecture- but it may have been more helpful for me to know I have the necessary equation down in my notes, then 'soak in' the theory behind it..| Lectures were very unorganized for this course. Would spend several classes on derivations of equations provided in the book and not enough example problems worked through..| it was ok.",2017 Fall
1004,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 7,"Yes.| Yes, he was, even for questions that did not pertain to his class..| The only time that I tried to visit the professor in his office hours, he was not in his room. However, the professor was still easily contacted through email..| yes.| Yes.| always available by email and in office hours.| Yes.| 10/10.| yes.| Yes.| Yes..| Yes. He was always in his office during his office hours and always responded to emails..| Yes.| Yes..| yes.| I only went once, but yes..| Yes..| Yes.| yes..| yes.| Yes..| Yes, he is always available..| Although I didn't need to spend time in office hours, the one grading issue I had was solved fairly and promptly..| yes.| seemed to be.| yes.| Definitely.| yes.| yes.| Yes, he was very responsive..| Yes, Dr. Young was always available for office hours and very responsive to emails..| Yes he was.| yes.| Yes..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes..| Very easy to get in touch with..| Yes.| Yes he was",2017 Fall
1005,ME 3120,Henry Young,Question 8,"No. Maybe. No time..| Overall, he is a good professor, but he could work on organization of the class and what will be covered on the exams. There were many questions on expectations for exams, therefore, it would be more helpful if he covered more examples and informed the class what topics to review..| no.| No.| Good teacher. Okay class. Lectures always felt rushed and there weren't a variety of examples problems. Usually only had time for one of each type of problem..| Doctor Young is overall a really good professor. He does a really good job of explaining the material and knows his stuff. The homework and exams can be difficult but reasonable. I would take this professor again for other classes as well, given the chance to. Good Job Doctor Young!.| No.| Perhaps with more time and without a student who continually interrupts the class. But these are things against the class and not the instructor..| Please post lecture material on pilot. It would have helped out greatly I believe..| Good instructor overall..| He was a really good professor, but he can lose his train of thought easy. If a student asks a question, sometimes it felt like he got completely lost in class. He would rebound in a couple minutes, but it just make class a little disconnected..| good.| Prof Young should write a little bigger on the board and stick to black marker. Also it might be beneficial to run through lectures ahead of time so they are more polished and prepared..| I enjoyed this course, its content and the instructor..| I enjoyed the class and the professor made that huge difference. I think the one major thing challenging Dr. Young is time. This is not a 50 min class kind of course. He is so thorough that we could only do one question each class. If class is only going to be 50 min. long, Dr. Young cannot completely convey the entire subject..| Good professor, I recommend..| The instructor teaches the class very well, but i do not think this class should be taught in 3 separate 55 minute lectures a week, because that is barely enough time to cover one concept or one problem, and on multiple occasions was not enough time to even finish a problem..| Well run class, enjoyable, good teaching skills.  The class project was started at a good time but the half classes at a time seemed less convenient then setting a class per week aside for the project. Also I was not aware there was a project till it started..| no.| nope.| Use the digital pen instead of board, it would simplify things.| I hope I can take another class with Dr. Young!.| I'd say for our final project, it may need to be changed to content that we have learned up until the date of assignment. We had a week left of in-class time to work and had just learned the material we needed to solve the project..| No.| Work more problems. Don't dwell so much on the theory, when Dr. Young could just provide the equation and then walk through how to apply the equation within a problem. I think that'd helped students far more than the theory does. If the students need more explanation, then refer them to the book. Otherwise, Dr. Young was a good instructor and I enjoyed the class and have a better understanding of the structures around me..| Questions on exams were way too tricky to the point where individuals with Master degrees in engineering got them incorrect..| No.| no.| Good professor.| No.| I know this is probably more department related topic, but this class should last much longer than 55 minutes. It's very hard to grasp a concept when examples have to be split over several days due to the time constraint. I think a 2+ hour class would be beneficial to many..| I feel as though he may have been over burdened by needing to teach this course due to budget cuts. But there also wasn't much structure to his lectures which was a detriment to myself. He curved exams rather fairly when he knew he made the exams too difficult for the time allotted to take them..| Returning of homework can take a very long time.  He helped me a lot in the beginning to be able to participate in his class.",2017 Fall

I would be lost in Matlab world without him. Truly. The way he teaches is phenomenal, and I can't wait to take more of his classes..| Dr Thomas did a great job conveying the content.

I wish Physics majors were required to take this class, I only took it as an elective to fill in my schedule to full time senior year.

Thank you so much for a GREAT semester!.| No.| no.| His policy on homework is ""no later than when the dropbox is due"" and that's it, regardless of whatever excuse you may have. While this isn't uncommon in colleges, it has no place in this class. On a number of occasions I was unable to turn in homework due to some bizarre Matlab error on my computer; it would crash when I would try to publish my code as a .pdf, and because of this I would have nothing to turn into the Dropbox. Thomas would not hear what was wrong with my computer, and refused to acknowledge my work despite knowing full well that I had completed the assignment before the deadline..| no.| I would like to thank him for a wonderful semester..| -.| Dr. Thomas is an amazing instructor who is extremely passionate about what he does. While he is in some ways a ""hard"" teacher because he follows the syllabus exactly with 0 deviations, at least you always know what to expect. I very much enjoyed him as an instructor and would love to have him for other classes..| Scott did a great job. Very likeable..| Great guy, bad at teaching Matlab.

Dr. Thomas is fantastic..| Overall, I had a good experience in Statics. I'm doing fairly well in the course (about a low A). I think you do a great job with answering questions in class, but I think you should focus your lectures more on the concepts of statics and I think you should spend some time linking the physics behind statics to the example problems from the lecture. Often times, when I would get to a big end of chapter problem I had issues linking that back to physics concepts. Also, I like your optimism in the classroom. It keeps me focused on an inherently boring topic. However, I did feel distracted by a lot of the joking in lecture. I mean it's fun and all, but let's keep a positive attitude and focus on the subject. I did enjoy this semester though!.| Dr. Thomas was one of the best professors I have ever had. He was very good at teaching the material and worked hard to ensure all students understood the material..| Very effective..| Dr. Thomas is an absolutely fantastic professor! One of the best at Wright State. He is extremely effective. He makes sure all of his students know what is going on and is willing to help them in any way possible..| Dr. Thomas was really engaging and he made sure every one of his students understood,..| He was a very good teacher..| His teaching technique was very beneficial to me since I am a person who learns by example.

He told us on the very first day that one of his most important words for the class is ""Fair."" He makes sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. He cares about the students and makes class fun..| Great teacher, he is probably one of the best engineering professors in this school. He is an amazing professor who genuinely cares. I do believe on one of the exams he expected a little too much i felt there was not a lot of time and the majority of the class did not finish or turn in their exams but think this is not his fault since the class length got cut in half from his previous classes he is still adjusting.

However, he did email us after each midterm as soon as he had finished grading the test to let us know the grades were in, which I thought was very helpful..| The instructor communicated effectively inside and outside the classroom..| He communicated very well throughout the semester both in and out of class..| He communicated well but as stated earlier, he seems to always be rushed which sometimes makes it difficult to understand material he teaches..| very effectively. answered emails promptly and was very helpful.| Amazing in the class he was super great. The issue that I had is in his office hours, there were lots of people there and also he flies through what u needed help with. I felt like the office hours were useless..| Communication is often clear, and he is more than willing to clarify any confusions..| Expectations were always very clear..| Communicated via email for upcoming tests and reminded us of homework assignments the beginning of every class and reviewed where we were at according to syllabus..| Extremely well..| he was very effective.| Very well..| Communication was very clear with Mr. Thomas in which he stayed a little after class to listen to questions, and had office hours that were clear..| yes",2017 Fall

If that makes sense? Like every time we would cover a new ""concept"" it would take two seconds to lecture about it and then we would go do problems. THIS IS OKAY, BUT I feel like it would've been better if you highlighted the concepts more instead of burying ourselves in example problems (that's what the homework is for!.| Yes, every class he walked into he had a plan for..| Yes, he knew what he doing each and every day..| The content and lectures are extremely organized. It feels like Dr. Thomas has every single thing we do planned out in advance, which maximizes our learning..| Yes..| Yes he was well organized..| Yes, he had a clear set of lesson plans that flowed well between each class, and the homework problems were all similar to the problems we did together in class..| Yes..| They were very organized..| He is very organized. He lectures over theory and then gives examples for each chapter..| yes.| They were very organized, everything was perfectly planned. Didn’t had an issue with that. He made everything interesting to learn. The issue that I had was the exams are worth 90% of the overall grade..| Each day has a specified topic, the lecture notes he works from are all available online, and everything you could ever want as additional reference material is also available online.

1021,ME 2120,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"I think his exams are too much of the grade....especially if there gonna be as hard as he makes them.

Best teacher hopefully able to take more classes with this professor in the future..| N/a.| Second time around taking this class and I really like his teaching style..| No.| Scott is a fantastic professor and a great person.  I have thoroughly enjoyed being in his class..| He was a great instructor for this course..| professor of the year award goes to him! Every year!.| Great professor and one of the nicest guys on campus.| I feel bad for the students who didn't have the opportunity to take Dr. Thomas this semester. I really do..| Overall, a good experience. If anything, I would say you need to push your students a little more. I know for example that I had a habit of just copying down the homework solutions from the website. I know it's not your job to make us take the initiative, but when all of the students taking this class are about in their second year of classes and taking 18 credit hours of hard math and core courses, this class can become less of a priority, WHICH SHOULDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE ME CLASS. I know that's not your fault, but overall your students might get something more if there were more intermediate examinations, like in class quizzes or something to kind of force us to study. At any rate, thanks for teaching this semester!.| Dr. Thomas was probably one of my favorite professors. He was fair, helpful, affective at teaching the material, and I would recommend/sign up for any other class he taught..| Dr. Thomas is my favorite professor on Wright State's campus. It warms my heart to know that some professors truly care about their students and want to see them succeed. I will be taking classes with Dr. Thomas every time my schedule allows it..| Dr. Thomas has a good system of teaching and is a wonderful teacher..| He was a great teacher.| Thank you for making Statics enjoyable, and I hope that I can take another class of yours before I graduate. -Lucas S..| He is a great professor..| We need more professors like this..| I think professor Thomas truly cares about his students learning and is a passionate professor..| Dr. Thomas is a great Professor.| Overall the class is grade, but he need to make the grading much easier. He is killing me when it comes to grading. 90% are coming from the exams. Also he is a reallly hard grader as well..| It's been a pleasure. I hope that I'll be able to work with you again in the future..| Scott Thomas is a great professor..| will look for more classes he teaches in the future..| He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. He will go out of his way to ensure the students who reach out to him have a full understanding of the content..| If you make the exams worth 20 points but only put two questions on it the chances of the class doing well will be slim. My problem would be that I would get one question right and the other wrong and it would dock me like 10-8 points and suddenly I have a D or F. Its a great class but for people who struggle with physic concepts, its demeaning when you get Ds on most of your exams. Extra credit is amazing but that doesn't reassure you as much. I rather have several little quizzes that are for extra credit but allow the professor to see where we stand in the class..| Overall, I think he taught his class very well and made the class fun..| no",2017 Fall

I would take Scott Thomas again in a heartbeat..| good.| Exceptional. I learn a lot in every Scott Thomas class. There is an appropriate amount of theory, examples, and application in lecture. It's (often) fair, and I know what is expected of me after every class, every week. Regardless of whatever grade I get in his class, I can walk away from it knowing that I know so much more than I did going into it, and I cannot say that about all my professors. It's not perfect, but it's close. If I had my way, I would have Dr. Thomas teach all my classes.

That's a fact. Class lectures weren't so upper level that they couldn't be understood. Many professors miss the mark by essentially wasting hours of class time on theory and derivation. As I said, there is an appropriate time spent doing this in Scott's class. I've had him for 55 minute classes (such as this class) and for 80 minute classes.

He genuinely wants you to succeed in his classes..| No..| No further comments.| You're a beast scott. keep up the good work..| Scott does an awesome job! Keep up the good work!.| He is a great professor and would recommend my peers to take him.| yes.| I don't agree with the exam blue book policy. In a class that stresses fairness, the idea that a student that didn't study can simply move the weight to the final really puts students who did study as a disadvantage. Not turning in the blue book skews the average and eliminates any potential for a curve.  It's also evident that difficulty of exam questions are based on the class's exam average. If the exam average is high on exam 1, students can predict there being a much-harder-than-normal problem on exam 2. It doesn't help that students not turning in a blue book can influence the next exam by skewing test averages. Not entirely fair, Dr. Thomas. Other than that, Dr. Thomas should teach a class about teaching, teach it in his style, and WSU needs to force all CECS professors to attend it..| Professor Thomas is good with utilizing class time efficiently. He ran through practice problems for most of the class time which I feel is very effective when trying to learn this type of material. The only critique would be that he sort of assumed that everyone was on the same level and covered the same material in Thermo 1 since he taught that as well. So it would’ve been nice if we could’ve reviewed the key concepts in the beginning more thoroughly..| Scott is a great professor and I enjoyed having this course with him. I hope he doesn't change. Probably my favorite teacher..| Dr. Thomas is a great professor and cares deeply for his students making sure they understand the material and have fun learning..| One of the best professors I have had throughout my college career, who actually cares about his students..| I very much enjoyed having him as an instructor and I cannot wait to have him again..| I enjoyed the class and material presented by Scott.

The first day of Capstone 1 he didn't show up claiming he thought the class started at 7:35pm rather than 7:35am. And this is the man in charge of my education. He was the most unorganized professor I've ever had to deal with, taking 5-10 minutes to set up for class, and keep in mind this was after he was late. Can't teach to save his life. Learned and retained very little information. I had him for Mechanics of Materials and because he didn't teach that very well my Mechanical Design 1 professor had to take time to teach us his material. Had him for System Dynamics and that was the biggest waste of time. The material is worth knowing but I didn't learn any of it thanks to him. Oh but I got a B in the class. He doesn't care if we learn, he just wants to give us the grade and go home..| yes.| He did a good job of making sure everyone was on track with their projects..| His being there is pointless..| Reasonably effective.| good.| very kind professor, good communicated with the students.| good.| He is a good instructor, but he needs to work on telling the students when deadlines are and when presentations will actually happen. As students, we spent a lot of time in the dark on when things were due and when to pick up notebooks. The times he listed were not always correct and sometimes he forgot to say anything at all. Now that being said, he did acknowledge his mistakes when he made them and tried to correct the ones he could..| Gets off of track very easily..| Very good..| He is so effective.| Very good.| Dr. Mian was an effective professor throughout this course..| he always available to answer any of the student considerations..| Average.| Dr. Mian would often wait too long to give us information we needed. He wasn't very helpful as far as providing necessary information..| Very effective.| he is perfect instructor",2017 Fall

I feel it can be learned outside of class and maybe the students understanding of the content can be evaluated in other ways like proctored quizzes..| -.| laughing and many interesting things.| he made sure we doing what we were suppose to.| Yes he did, he found individuals to come speak with us about topics that we will run into in the work force..| Meetings a couple of times though out the semester..| Held meetings to make sure we understood what was happening and that everything was okay.| Yes.| For this course he brought in speakers to talk about our senior design projects and other topics that were interesting..| well he always available to answer any mechanical related questions. i always go to his office with questions that sometime lead the conversation into another conversation full of useful information..| set  up regular meetings with our group.| He met with us each week to make sure we understood what we were learning.

1042,ME 4920,Akm Mian,Question 5,"Semi effectively.| well spoken.| Emails were last minute and very poorly times. It was very frustrating..| Yes.  He communicated well..| good.| Pretty awful. Often times we had to email him asking a question that should've been answered weeks prior. We missed or nearly missed a lot of deadlines because either it wasn't on the syllabus or he didn't tell us about them. And while we're on the subject of the syllabus, it might as well not exist. He picks and chooses when he wants to follow it..| He did a great job communicating..| Well enough to get the important dates across.| Well enough.| good.| like to hear and listen from all the students.| good.| Well, minus when he forgot to tell us due dates..| Did not answer emails back in a timely manor. Gave due dates the day of with no warnings..| The emails he sent were a bit on short notice sometimes. For example, at 8am one day he said that notebooks were due at 9 but myself and a few other classmates were already at work..| yes.| He was somewhat effective communicating in and out of the classroom. Sometimes he was too vague which did not help us when we needed specific information..| in class he never skipped any student question, and in emails he always have a quick response if the question sent to him before 11 pm..| average.| He would provide emails to let us know of upcoming events or schedules. He would answer questions in class..| Very effectively..| very good",2017 Fall

1045,ME 4920,Akm Mian,Question 8,"Dr. Mian is new to teaching capstone. Our class had no idea what was really expected of us and hopefully this has given him the experience needed for his next capstone course..| Dr. Mian is another professor in the ME department that should not be teaching. Every class I have had with him has been a waste of my time and money. As long as he remains teaching core classes, WSU ME students will be cheated out of education and money..| no.| Start caring about our education. It will help a lot of students out if he actually taught the material versus whatever it is he does now. Get more organized, please. Again, I've never had any personal issues with Mian. I think he's a nice guy. But he can't teach in any way shape or form and he's the worst professor I've ever had..| No.| great professor.| no.| no.| Need to give documents sooner then the night before an assignment is due. Also give due dates sooner then what was given. Never any time to plan around work. Most students taking this course are in internships and work on a regular basis..| Nope..| yes.| No.| i took 4 classes with him and by far he is the best professor..| Mian is a good guy, but not the best instructor.

1046,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 1,"The instructor was overall fairly effective, though some explanations could afford to be clearer..| He is a good professor..| explained information in good detail for both the hw and quiz's to be done in a simple matter.| He did a good job at making the course content easy to understand, and he also answered questions.  This made the class easy for me..| It was alright..| Great professor - Subject could be taught with great efficiency if it was not a split level course..| Dr. Bae is a good teacher.  I feel like he conveys information very well..| Ha-Rok Bae is not the most effective professor I've had in my college career. Often the only usable notes I have are the example problems we do in class and even then, they are cryptic. Most of the knowledge I gained in the class came from the text and my own personal research..| Dr. Bae was very effective in teaching this class. He provided summary notes, that were very helpful, in addition to showing multiple ways to solve a problem. The only drawback was that the material is very repetitive which leads to some tuning out during lecture. I think some more classworks would have been able to prevent that..| Overall pretty effective. He does this annoying thing where he writes on the board on top of stuff he's already written, and it's very hard to follow. His writing is also not the greatest. If he turned on the lights by the chalkboard it would be easier to see too, but mainly I wish he'd erase the whiteboard..| Very effective instructor. Broke down the material to be extremely simple and understandable..| he is very good at teaching the material. he is very experienced and knowledgeable..| Ha Rok Bae was a very effective instructor..| Dr. Bae taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams..| He tries to explain things thoroughly, which is appreciated, and goes over examples.  He starts class without warning and gets upset that we haven't started listening even though no one realizes he's started. He does not offer his extra credit fairly - he only allowed 10 people extra credit which brings everyone else's extra credit average down. (But at least we get a chance at extra credit) He does not teach towards his exams and its hard to be prepared for his exams because the homework isn't similar to the exam and he keeps changing the structure of his exams so you can never get used to it. He has a very strict partial credit scale that does not allow for ANY mistakes..| Dr. Bae is lazy..| The instructor seemed to know the material very well. One issue was that he used a lot of MATLAB and WOLFRAMATICA in class to solve some of the problems. This was not terrible because we could use them for the homeworks, but they were not available on the exam. This made it difficult to know how to do some of the exam problems by hand because we learned them on software that we couldn't use for the exams..| Dr. Bae is very enthusiastic about the course material and about teaching it to others. He strives to make sure everyone understands the underlying basic principles and general procedures before diving into the theory and derivation of the complex topics covered. Dr. Bae's approachability helped me to grasp the concepts and ask him questions after class when I didn't quite understand something in the textbook or homework..| Not effective in the slightest. Had unreasonable expectations for graduate students compared to undergraduate students..| i.| Very Poor.| The classes were poorly organized. The lectures were spratic and it was next to impossible to follow his notes on the board. In addition he would have 3 sets of notes on the projector and then jump all around the board with hard to read comments. He would show the problems in matlab and mathmatica and then test us on how to do it by hand which we would not know how to do. He would often go over time and freeze the time on the board in an effort to make us think it was still 9:18. Overall very unimpressed with the class structure and lay out..| Terrible. Learning had to be done via youtube tutorials. Was not available during office hours. Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions..| Very effective with use of plenty of examples and teaching strategies..| Pretty good, I felt I learned a lot on finding the deflection, stress and reaction forces of structures..| Dr.Bae is one of the most effective instructors. He is a knowledgeable person and have an excellent teaching skill..| Finite element analysis is one of the core subject for mechanical designing.  Dr. Bae has taught this course very effectively.  Ease in understanding the subject and demonstrated the subject better. He has given a detailed explanation of each and every other topic and made it more specific by teaching several related examples..| Overall Dr Bae is good instructor but its hard to get excellent grades in his course, beacuse exams are harder compared to others..| Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly..| Effectiveness is normal. not good, not bad. we get only theoretical knowledge which is available in textbook also..| pros Very Professional in work ethic cons solves few problems, cannot understand matter completely, boring, lack of examples, tough paper and tough grader, lots of homework, information can be improved.| sometimes it gets difficult to pay attention in class. It gets monotonous and boring, the professor has no trick to gather students attention or keep them involved..| One of the best professors who has taught me.

1047,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 2,"Yes..| Yes..| yes.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes,.| Yes, generally, but I also think that his homework grading was a little bit harsh.  We often had to use the book to figure out how to complete the problems, and often from poorly worded questions on the book's part.  The book was not very good overall, so it was never any surprise when I didn't get a homework question correct.  Also, the feedback on the homework was usually very vague and unhelpful..| Yes, Ha-Rok Bae evluated the work we did based on the concepts and principals of FEA..| Yes he followed his syllabus closely in addition to providing a rubric for the project. He also went over what he looks for in his exams (albeit after the exam)..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes..| He evaluated us based on his very flawed grading scale. The work was relevant to the subject, but did little to prepare us for the exam..| Yes..| Yes.| I believe that he evaluated my work based upon the expectations described in the course syllabus. The grading was fair and he offered plenty of opportunities for extra credit (on the exams)  and bonus work (in class)..| Instructor offered very little partial credit on exams. ""All or nothing"" grading style..| Very unclear on what is expected. Always felt he wanted to hide what was expected so students will do bad. Did not care as much of student learning as he did about his own work..| He did not give partial credit. Hes grading seemed quite inconsistent. As a grad student you might as well just take 20 points off at the beginning because the graduate problems were either tricks or never covered in class..| No. Grading was 10, 5, or 0.  Mistakes in part A took off points in parts B-G in a problem worth 50% of the grade. The graduate curve was calculated from undergrad grades that have 30+pts of extra credit..| Yes, course guidelines were followed correctly and understood at beginning of semester..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, Dr. Bae organised the mid terms exams really well. He made sure he covered all the topics during the examination and used to evaluate the written work properly..| Yes.| Yes.| no.| Yes, but tough in grading.| Yes..| Yes, the evaluation was as expected.",2017 Fall

He started class exactly when the clock struck 8:00 pm. He would normally start writing on the white-boards and the class of 60+ people would begin to quiet down. Dr. Bae used the full class period (8:00pm - 9:20 pm) to teach the material..| Yes.| Always starts on time, often times would just start teaching without any notice and very quietly. Many times held us over the end of class and was very unclear on when class ended.| Started on time and often went over.| No. Pacing for the class was clunky. We spent an entire 1.5hr lecture looking at Mathematica code. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we went through 3 chapters..| Yes, always..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, Dr. Bae was always on time and used full class period and made a very good effectiveness on the subject..| sharp on the time.| Yes he is very accurate in time..| yes, this is good thing in instructor. very punctual..| Yes, very punctual.| Yes..| Yes, Dr. Bae was spot on.",2017 Fall

He was even nice enough to look at a MATLAB code I'd done and check it for errors, which is tedious to do. I appreciated that..| Would provide extra material outside of the class for further study. Would always stop to make sure everyone understood the lecture..| he made sure i understood what the course talked about and how other courses contributed to it.| Yes.| Dr. Bae would have us work out examples with him in class to make sure we understood the material..| No.| Dr. Bae was willing to stay after class to answer my questions about homework problems and lecture material. He also did this for other students as well..| Limited interest in student learning..| Class itself seemed very interesting, however he never truly explained the content or material  but rather showed a matlab code on how the problem was done. Students were not allowed to use matlab on exams so many classes were spent wasting time on matlab code..| No.| No, was not available during posted office hours..| By relating problems solved in class to how the FEA software directly uses the math in real world..| Answered questions in class, used Matlab to work out problems and Mathematica for derivations. Made code used in class available for use to experiment with.| Dr.Bae uses his experience while solving problems he applies the formulas to actual real world problems and teaches the approach to solve them. Which makes everyone to focus on his lecture..| Dr. Bae has provided labs regularly for having a practical demonstration on this subject and also made us choose our own project and work on it for better understanding of the subject which had made me gain more interest in this subject..| Yes.| Shows interest to share knowledge to us..| just asked the question that, is there any question. ? and nothing else.| not very much.| Not at all..| Dr. Bae was interconnecting practicality with the concepts being taught.

1050,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 5,"Communication was usually effective, with occasional confusion..| Yes..| fair.| Good.| Alright..| communication was open and easy fast responses and flexibly availability.| Yes, very much so..| Ha-Rok made it clear that he was available outside of class for office hours and would answer questions to the best of his ability in class..| N/a.| Very well..| Very effectively.| he was very flexible with office hours and email..| ok.| Dr. Bae used email and Pilot to communicate with us well..| The professor would hide away in his office when I try to contact him..| Good.| Dr. Bae used Pilot News to assign homework problems. It would have been nice to have an inclass announcement during the day when he posted them. I learned to check Pilot just before class time so that I would not miss a posting. Dr. Bae communicated effectively inside the classroom. Unfortunately, I felt the class room was a bit large. His hand writting on the fourth white-board was sometimes hard to read when I was sitting on the side of the first whiteboard. Despite this challenge, Dr. Bae was always willing and able to tell us what he wrote down if we could not clearly see it from where we were sitting..| Not helpful during office hours. Often made mistakes during lecture..| very poorly. I did not do well on the first exam but after going over it i felt i did not receive much partial credit especially for a class that is very partial credit heavy in terms on content. Basically a sign mistake or an error in calculations gets only half credit and any mistake after that will get you no credit. Every problem was double and triple penalized for the same mistake many times.  When i tried to get help a couple times he was in his office, he would shut the lights off and even though I knocked on the door he did not answer. As I walked away, he turned his lights back on and even came out of his office to throw something away. When I walked back to his office because I clearly saw him walk back, his lights shut off again and he didn't answer when I knocked..| His office hours were after the class 930-1030 at night and it was difficult to find time outside of that for consolation. He was very unclear with his instructions (cribsheet size for example). He also was quite confusing trying to explain the course content. I believe he understood the material well but struggled communicating it with the class in a way they could understand..| Could not communicate in English, therefore did not understand questions. Notes were illegible, both in lecture and online.  Learning was done by looking at another teacher's notes, the book, or outside sources..| Very well through use of email and pilot..| Pretty good, homeworks were posted on Pilot, everything else was available through Pilot.| Dr.Bae is professional and punctual. He always clarifies the doubts of any student in the class,he explains it to everyone. Outside the class he helps in understanding and how to approach certain problem students can’t solve. He is a great help..| Ease in understanding the subject, demonstrated each and every other topic . Clarified doubts even during the office hours and also during additional appointment hours..| Fairly good.| In class communication is better as compared to out of class..| communication is moderate..| Not very approachable.| Too technical and a bit difficult to understand..| Dr. Bae was pretty much effective in communicating the concepts both in and out of the classroom.",2017 Fall
1051,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 6,"Course content was overall well organized, though technical issues occasionally occurred..| Yes..| yes.| Yes.| Could probably be a little more refined..| Content was organized but too in depth for undergrad. A lot of focus on the backgrounds and proofs of why more geared towards the grad level. This caused a lot of needed application time and examples needed to be sacrificed..| Generally the lectures seemed a bit scattered.  This is mostly due to the fact that Dr. Bae uses pre-written notes on a projector, which makes it hard to copy down and allows him to go back and reference earlier parts while adding new material.  In other words, he jumped around the notes a lot, which made it had to copy into our notebook.  Also, the use of MATLAB in order to solve the problems was typically unhelpful to my understanding.  I would have rather spent the time it took to write the scripts in class actually working through a problem by hand to completion, even if that means that some of the matrix addition had to be skipped due to time constraints.  This material is generally very systematic, which means that if we see the process a few times it should be satisfactory.  But writing a script just made it seem more convoluted..| The material in the lecture did not line up with the lab at all, which made it seem like we were taking two totally seperate classes..| Yes.| Some content would have made more sense in a different order, the best example being the final lecture on software FEA techniques which would have been very helpful prior to completing the term project but was only given after the due date..| Yes except for the writing on top of other stuff on the board thing..| Yes.| yes.| the content and lectures were well organized.| Yes..| Vaguely. He went off of his past notes, which were available online. That was very helpful. Honestly, if he put up his notes and examples THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE EXAM, then I wouldn't have a problem with the class at all..| No..| It was a little bit difficult to follow sometimes when we jumped around in chapters but otherwise it was ok..| Yes. I felt the material was well organized. I was a little confused as to why the chapter organization started out as 1, 2, 16, 17, 18, but it was much clearer by the time I finished the class. I now know that the lecture was organized this way to make the theory in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 much easier to understand. The textbook is organized in such a way that allows instructors to adapt the material to fit their curriculum needs..| Course content seemed to be all over the place. Was not comprehensive..| Very unorganized. Often times didn't bring his notes and he would ask a student where class ended previously..| no.| No. Pacing for the class was clunky.

1053,ME 4120,Harok Bae,Question 8,"Usage of pilot could be more effective. The Course syllabus, lab schedule, and the only existing link to the project guidelines were posted in the news feed only.  Homework was posted in this news feed, but this news feed does not display on the pilot homepage, nor does it update the course calendar on pilot with due dates, making sorting out due dates a challenge occasionally..| The FEA project could have been a little different.  I think maybe we should have been given a part to analysis without the directions and then do the analysis ourselves to get the right answers. It took a long time to figure this out for the project since we were never really taught how to use the software, because the labs were just follow the instructions to get the right answers..| nope.| Need more examples hand done like the exams will be. more so than the Mat Lab to save time. Proofs and theory can be read in the book and spending great time explain why it works is less helpful then showing how it works..| Dr. Bae is one of my favorite teachers at Wright State.  He's very nice and very intelligent.  He really seems to care about teaching students and he does a good job with tough material..| I would like to see more use of the text in class, that way we have some reference to come back to if we get confused while studying..| I am sad that he is not teaching vibrations next semester.| Would have preferred if the notes on Pilot were more complete. I attended every class and took what I thought were adequate notes but techniques taught in class were not always the same as those in the textbook and the inability to go back and look at the material that we went over in class made some sections difficult. A more full set of online notes existed, they were shown in classes, but were not posted to Pilot. The lab syllabus was mentioned repeatedly, but there apparently was no lab syllabus. This was confusing..| He was funny!.| no.| Poor. Ineffective teacher. Please remove him..| I would recommend Dr. Bae for future classes..| Offer more partial credit on exams. Too harsh on graduate students compared to undergraduate..| Another unfortunate situation is due to the shortage of classes if anyone fails this class this semester they cannot retake it until fall of 2018. So if you are supposed to graduate in Spring 2018 your graduation will be delayed 2 semesters for 1 class in which no partial credit or explanation for mistakes or help was given. This is not fair to the student. Many people will be affected due to this. He is also very unclear on the crib sheet and what is expected on exams. Often times I felt like he was trying to hide what he wanted just so students will do bad..| The lab TA also could not communicate in clear English. A project worth 5% of the final grade was given with numerous grammatical errors..| The labs were not as effective as I felt they could have been. I felt they were focused more on following directions rather than actually learning how to use the software. Many times I didn't know why I was doing something, I just knew that things would work if I did. I felt a lot more things could have been learned, such as element type selection, were left on the table because we had instructions to follow. This made the final project not very effective because I didn't understand the software. I felt the final project would have been better served to be set up like a lab but without the step by step instructions. I think that was basically how it was set up anyway but I'm not really sure.  I though the examples worked in class should have focuses more on running through the problem from step up to end. I felt like quantity of examples work took precedent over quality of examples worked. Using MAtlab to demonstrate problems didn't really help me because I couldn't have Matlab on the exams. If distributed loads was going to be such a big part of the second exam, I think we should have covered it better than we did. I had a total of page of notes of the subject and half of that was the background on the topic and some stuff we did in Matlab with it. We never covered distributed loads in local coordinate systems not aligned with the global coordinate systems and it wasn't in the book. I felt like that was a topic that was important enough to cover more extensively anyway, regardless of its involvement on the exam. Speaking of the exams, one side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet. I was limited on the exams because I could not fit everything necessary to complete the exam on the crib sheet. I can remember some of the more extensive matrices or equations so I would rely on the crib to do that for me but since I couldn't fit everything on there I was between a rock and a hard place. I don't understand why we had to be so limited. I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final since there is more material to cover. It just seemed ridiculous.  (I forgot to put this on my Mechanical Vibrations review but what were you thinking adding a homework assignment and making it due during finals week. Really? I don't know why you couldn't have made it like this class were the last homework assignment was posted with the answers for our review to help us on the final and not for a grade. Seemed completely unnecessary in my opinion).| Dr.Bae gives a student friendly question with a very small twist. The only problem some students face during exam is they are unable complete all the answers in time even if they know how to solve the entire problems..| No..| For bonus questions in exams, he doesn't give half score even if answer is half correct..| We get more difficult exam paper as expected..| The exams question are too different than prof taught in lectures. I saw some questions that never faced in homeworks, classworks and in lectures. We never get any small kind of sample like such questions. exams were really hard and each question include many twists in it. Every question is tricky and something different that never imagined and experienced in practical and theorotical life..| I'm glad to have a professor like him.",2017 Fall
1054,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 1,"He was average for the ME department. a lot of what you learn is taught through homework and examples so as long as you follow along then it should be fine.| He is a good professor..| He did a good job at explaining the course content, and he answered questions.  This made the class easy for me..| Alright..| Very effective lectures.  Good balance of theory and examples..| i.| Pretty effective. Seemed to get better the further we got into the course..| Dr. Bae was a very effective instructor.  I was able to understand exactly when he was trying to emphasize some critical concept for the course.  He was able to relate the real engineering applications to the theoretical knowledge that he was teaching us.  It was very beneficial to me since I had completed my undergrad ME degree many years ago and have some experience with the engineering applications outside the classroom.  I think he presented the complex concepts in an effective manner that was easy to understand..| Good instructer, but its hard to get good scores in his subject.| Overall effectiveness is good. Covers all topic clearly..| normal..| professional, lack of visual approach",2017 Fall

1056,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 3,"yes.| Yes..| Yes, always.| Yes..| Yes.| Since I am paying for my graduate degree out of pocket, I appreciated his efficient and prompt use of class time.  He was mindful of his timing and was very good at avoiding the spanning of complex material presentation across class periods..| Yes.| Yes he is very accurate in time..| yes, very punctual..| yes.| Yes.",2017 Fall
1057,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 4,a lot of times he mistook silence as understanding (not totally his fault) or had difficulty understanding why we may be confused on a topic.| Yes..| He did a good job at answering students' questions..| Lab..| Yes.| Answered questions in class. Used animations to visually demonstrate how the formulas were working.| He supported my learning by making himself available outside normal class periods to answer questions which was appreciated..| He answer clearly our questions and doubts.| Shows interest to share knowledge to us..| no.| no doesn't seem to care.| None. The classes were monotonous and boring.,2017 Fall
1058,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 5,well enough.| Yes..| Good.| Alright..| Very well.| Pretty good. Homeworks were posted on Pilot.| He communicated promptly and effectively with me whenever I emailed him..| fairly good.| In class communication is better as compared to out of class..| very few..| not very approachable.| Not at all. Difficult to understand.,2017 Fall
1059,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 6,"yes.| Yes..| Yes.| Could be more refined..| Very much so.| Yes.| The course was well organized except that we did not cover the last section on the course syllabus due to insufficient class time remaining.  It was related to design problems and I was looking forward to it.  This isn't really a negative comment towards Dr. Bae because he had to spend some extra in other sections but it would have been nice to cover.  I will be reading the design related sections on my own time after the course is over..| Yes.| Yes it is well organized..| not so well..| yes, but strict grader.| Yes.",2017 Fall

I never had to go to office hours..| Yes..| Yes.| Yes.| He was very responsive,  I had no issues communicating with him during office hours and via email..| Yes.| He is available at office hours and appointments..| available on line.| yes.| Yes.",2017 Fall
1061,ME 4210,Harok Bae,Question 8,"in class work is appreciated but some times students need more time to complete problems.| I think the labs had nothing to do with the course. It was based on chapter 6 which was not covered in class and was considered an grad level section of the class..| The labs were the most useless things I have ever seen. Did absolutely nothing to enhance my knowledge of the subject. I know you said that the labs can't always line up with what is taught in class (at least I think you said that, it might have been said in FEA I'm not entirely sure) but they weren't even close. I had no idea what was going on in the labs. We wasted time trying to collect data when ultimately we would normally be sent the data to use for the reports. The lab time would have been better used explaining how to analyze the data. Of course, it sounds like you were pretty hands off the labs, and didn't really know what was going on with them. So I don't know if it was the TA that was the problem, or the lab set up or what it was, but they were a complete waste of time in my opinion. I wish we would have worked through more examples start to finish in class instead of rushing through different parts of them. It seemed that quantity was valued over quality at times just to get more examples on the board. I would have appreciated it if you would have slowed down some and fully worked all aspects of the problems out to serve as a road map.  One side of half a sheet of paper was not enough for a crib sheet and I have my doubts that one side of a piece of paper will be enough for the final (I didn't mention this on my FEA review but this statement applies there as well). There was a lot of material covered in class. I was limited on my performance on the second exam not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because I couldn't fit all the necessary equations on my crib sheet and couldn't remember what it was. The crib sheet serves as a reference so we can focus on how to use the formulas and not on what the formulas are. There was a lot of formulas for the second exam and I can only write so small to try to fit them all on my crib sheet. On the topic of the second exam, I understand that the conceptual things are important, but it seemed kinda overkill to make them 70% of the exam when most of class time is spent on application. The exams should reflect what we are doing in class. I understand that a few questions are alright to make sure that we understand the basis why we do things, but 70% of the exam broken up into 10% chucks which are basically hit or miss didn't seem like the best way to test that..| I appreciated his professionalism and depth of knowledge on the subject.  I look forward to signing up for other classes that he teaches..| No.| We get more difficult exam paper as expected..| Concepts were not clear, too fast and exams were very tricky and twisting. each question is tricky.",2017 Fall
1062,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"Not very effective at all. Constantly argued that he was right about every question until shown in the book he was wrong. Never helped students review or understand how to solve problems at the same level as the ones on his exams..| Amir spends his lectures completely reading definitions from the textbook with little example problems. He does not do a good job preparing you for future related courses at all..| Very good at explaining theory, but reads straight from the book for anything else. Lessons do not help with homework..| I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class. I learned more from the book. He just writes things straight from the book he doesn't add or make learning any material from the book easier..| Okay instructor.| Yes, the instructor evaluated my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus. I am passing but, I have struggled in this course so far. In class we pretty much go through the chapter with very little examples which makes it hard when the homework is not conceptual questions only math problems which we hardly ever go over in class. The only reason that I am passing the class is because one of the three questions on exams is conceptual question which is weighted the most on exams. Need more examples in class and less conceptual notes..| not effective at all. I probably have to take it again due to his class structure and test structure. None of the examples  from our homework assignments nor what was discussed in class were on the exams.| didnt learn a thing.| Dr. Farajian was not an effective professor. For most of the semester, he was showing up late to class anywhere between 2-15 minutes late. Our first exam we had, he was 15 minutes late and kicked us out of the room right at 4:30 which was our end time. During lecture, he did mostly theory and barely any examples. Our test grades were not that great because we had little experience with working problems. It wasn't until after our second exam when he finally listened to us and started doing more examples in class. Although his examples were always a problem he would have us work out of the book with our tables and give extra credit to the first table to answer. Most of them he wouldn't even go over how to do after someone answered..| very poor, learned nothing from his lectures.| bad.| I didn't really understood him had to read the text book a lot to better understand the marital.| Dr. Farajian has been the worst professor I have ever experienced. Class always started 5-10 minutes late everyday. His lectures consisted of scribbles of vaguely  summarized formulas from the textbook, and he also never worked through a single example problem during his lectures. The only problems that were discussed during class were worked through amongst our table ""groups"" with only a single answer stated by the professor. Dr. Farajian never once worked through solution to any problem for the duration of the course. these are just facts of what has happened. His demeanor was terrible. the professor came off as very arrogant and unapproachable..| Dr. Amir Farajian is a very nice and intelligent professor. He understands the topic he teaches. Over all his form of teaching was not effective for myself or the class. The questions he asked where usually hard to understand and then answer. The other struggle facing his students was a clear expectation with the projects and the exams. The final problem I had was the projects we had before each exam. These projects where a good source of points, however, he was not clear on his expectations and when the projects was complete and turned in, it appeared he didn't read them; just used turn-it-in to evaluate the project. I am under the impression that this class is not supposed to be taught well as a sort of ""weed out class""..| The instructor was ineffective in grading papers and getting them back.  Also, he rarely would respond to emails.  He was effective in his teaching..| I thought this teacher did a very poor job teaching the material..| When doing these course evaluation surveys I often go through them quite brief; However, Dr. Farajian's performance MUST be addressed in every manner and so I will do my best to fully explain my experience for every question.  For the overall effectiveness of this instructor: Dr. Amir Farajian has been the least effective instructor that I have had in my three years of college for engineering. I am not evaluating this decision based off of any personal emotion, but by comparison of other professors in my past experience. Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware. Dr. Farajian did not have any plan laid out for the class and had no dates set for class assignments, quizzes, or even grade returns. His plan for lecture was to bring in a text book and go through/skip specific parts (he explained only as much material as the book did, rarely went into further detail). If questions were asked beyond the books material, the answer would be both scarce and questionable, almost hesitant. Almost all of the material handed into Dr. Farajian was never returned back to the students, which made it difficult to use for any further studying. As far as grades, students would not receive grades for an average of weeks. (Exams: 2 Weeks, HW: 2 Weeks, Quiz: 1 Week, Projects; 2.75 Weeks)..| His class time is well spent, easy to understand..| After retaking this class with Dr. Farajian I don't believe I've learned anything new. In fact I feel as if I've lost knowledge from the previous spring semester. Lectures were dedicated to definitions instead of working through problems until 3/4s of the way through the semester when students went to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian to discuss concerns for the class. Only after that were examples done in class at a slightly increased frequency. I understand it's Dr. Farajians first time teaching this class, but I did not find the way class was conducted to be very effective at all..| Dr. Farajian does a good job explaining the theory behind thermodynamics..| He needs to be evaluated. He does not know how to teach at all..| He knew the material well. However class time was not spent effectively. He showed up late to class for the majority of the semester. We never finished all the material we were supposed to cover. He did not give back graded exams. Students had to come during the thirty minute office hours to look at their exams and then hand them back over to the professor before leaving. The professor always kept the exams, even though it would have been more beneficial for students to get their exams back and see the solutions. He was very ineffective..| He made sure that we knew the concepts. He also made us do projects that did not help us with our learning in any way..| less effective than reading the notes from the book a classmate took while drunk.| Anything Amir said or taught in class was 90% of the time just a paraphrased version of what was said in the book. Going to class was often no more helpful than simply skimming the material on my own time..| no.| Poor teacher, reads straight from the book and covers few examples.  Never covers how to use charts in thermo book properly.  Consistently late to class and canceled class multiple times, barley finished one chapter for the final section of the class which was supposed to cover 3 chapters.",2017 Fall
1063,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 2,"no.| Yes.| yes, grading was outlined well in the syllabus..| His syllabus needed a grade scale and also for the projects a more descriptive rubric..| Mostly. Group projects weren't clearly defined in the syllabus and no information about presentations/presentation grading was giving. Number of exams/projects/homework were mostly as expected..| Yes.| no h.| yes, lenient.| There were many things that he did not put in the syllabus that we were unaware of grading wise. For example, we had 3 projects we had to complete throughout the semester. Our first project was a disaster because the only thing in the syllabus was the requirements of the paper (i.e. single spaced, 12 point font, times new roman, and each table member had to write 2 pages.). There were no guidelines for our PowerPoint presentation that had to accompany the paper and we did not know how things were going to be graded. A lot of people didn't do well on the first project because we did not know what he was wanting and he refused to answer questions about it until after the first project was done..| not at all.| no.| yes.| the weight of the different types of work in the class are accurate but the professor did not execute the course well at all..| He evaluated our work based off of loose expectations that were broadly misinterpreted..| Yes.| no..| Dr. Farajian's syllabus was both limited and was not followed in certain areas. The biggest issue with the course syllabus, which I witnessed but did not encounter personally, was that the syllabus was very extensive; When students would bring up issues with how their projects were graded Dr. Farajian would use the syllabus and it's gaps in the instructions to support his grading marks. Although Dr. Farajian has the right to grade how he seems fit, I do not believe it is fair to the students to bend the syllabus after students have already completed the project and received a bad grade..| yes.| Yes, the course syllabus described the expectations for the course thoroughly. There were a few times in which we needed clarification for the expectations though..| yes.| His way of grading is beyond me. ive never seen anything like this class, its a joke. on our second project he told us we got 5% taken off because we didnt look prepared walking up to him. even though we answered every question he threw at us and confused him because he didnt even know what he was asking us. we recieved a 95% on that project i feel as though he was mad at our group because we out smarted him..| Yes. The syllabus did not give much information. The instructor did not get through all the material that the syllabus said we should get through..| The projects were not graded in the same way the syllabus explained. The grades were arbitrarily graded based on the originality report and the way we answered questions during our presentation. None was based on the technical content of the paper..| no.| Homework and exams were graded fairly, but Amir never gave us a syllabus for the projects, so the grade distribution for them was unnecessarily all over the map..| Expectations were not clear for the first two midterms.  It would be helpful to have point values assigned on the exam for each question..| no",2017 Fall
1064,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 3,"No. Was consistently 10-15 minutes late.| Absolutely not. He was between 5-10 minutes late nearly every day..| Was never on time to class. He showed up 15 min late for an exam..| He has been on time once this semester. Other than that he was late everyday..| Usually late to class and then had to take time to set up projectors beyond already being late, which took up a significant amount of time for a 55 min class..| No, on multiply occasions he was anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes late, including on the day of our first exam.| Has been 5-10 minutes late the whole semester only on time these last few weeks..| definitely not. many many times class started more than 15 minutes late. He was actually 30 mins late to the first exam!!!.| half the time 5 minutes late.| I believe there were 3 classes total this semester that Dr. Farajian showed up to class on time. As stated above, he was almost always late to class..| nope usually late.| no always late.| No was sometimes late to class.| class was always 5-10 sometimes 15 minutes late and class time was poor utilized as well..| yes.| The teacher would show up around five minutes late most days..| no he would usually come in late..| Dr. Farajian was consistently late to class (average of 5 minutes late to a 55 minute class; I know this because I recorded his attendance every day). His attendance also included a cancelation of more than one class, always a couple hours ahead of time, which lead to several students being unaware..| yes.| Again, until about 3/4s of the way through the class he was nearly always late. Students even ended up guessing each day how late he would be that day. Even for our first exam he was 10 minutes late. Since speaking to Dr. Slader and Dr. Farajian, he did start coming pretty consistently on-time to class..| yes.| no, he was never on time I stopped counting after Thanksgiving but he was up to 170 min of being late..| Almost never. There might have been 2-4 classes that he started on time. Towards the end of the semester he realized we would not get through all the material so he showed up on time to class..| Quite often he was late by 10 minutes. He was even 10-15 minutes late to our first exam..| he was late so often we would as a class we would each mark on the white board how late we thought he would be. He needs a new watch more than he needs to be replaced as the instructor of this class..| At the very beginning and end of the semester, he would begin and end class on time, but during the bulk of the semester he would arrive 5 to 10 minutes after class was supposed to have started. Throughout the semester, regardless of whether or not he was on time, he often spent an unnecessary amount of time discussing semi-relevant information about the upcoming assignments..| The first portion of the semester was rarely started on time (5-10 minutes late). This improved the second part of the semester..| for most of the semester he was always late to class to the point the class started to bet what time he would come into class that day.| NO, professor was almost never on time to class.",2017 Fall
1065,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 4,"He didn't.| No. Whenever you ask him a question, his answer would always lead up to him blaming you for not knowing the material..| He was interested for the first few weeks of class, but became less and less concerned with how much we were actually learning..| HE DIDN'T. He just came in wrote text straight from the book on the board. I would have been better off taking this course somewhere else like Sinclair..| Extra credit opportunities that encouraged solving problems and answering questions in class..| No he seemed to lecture only reading out of the book.| didn't seem to care. just wanted to collect a paycheck. I'm disappointed I have spend my hard earned money for this instructor to teach me absolutely nothing.| somewhat.| He would always tell us we need to pay attention whenever someone was talking about an idea because ""it is all very interesting stuff"". He seemed to enjoy teaching the subject and always told us this is a great class for engineers but I am not too convinced he cared about our interest in the topic..| very belittling.| not good.| By giving out projects.| there was no interest in our learning. the professor was very unapproachable.| There was more of an air of frustration in our learning than an interest in our learning..| Yes, I believe he did.  He asked conceptual questions to test our understanding of the subject..| no..| From my observations and personal opinion, there was no interest in my learning. Many students, including myself, expressed our frustrations and concerns towards our experience in Dr. Farajian's class and they seemed to be almost disregarded..| He tried to carry everyone along.| He demonstrated interest in a strange way. During class he would ask us questions and try to get us to answer them. The issue was that his questions weren't clear so we had to keep guessing wrong until he further clarified what he was trying to get at. Unfortunately that was also true for our group projects and the lack of clarity ended up affecting our presentation grades..| By listening to each individual groups presentations for projects three separate times throughout the semester..| He would give you a sneary look if you asked a question then would say see me after class if he didnt know it.| He told us what important concepts we needed to understand and posted homework solutions..| He gave a lot of extra credit even though it was difficult to earn sometimes..| He didn't..| To his credit, he encouraged us to research somewhat obscure, unconventional topics for our projects..| he didnt at time.| Demonstrated zero interest in my learning.",2017 Fall
1066,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 5,"Was very poor with communication and failed to answer any email with questions regarding the course or course material..| His office 'half-hour' once a week is not nearly enough for the courses he is teaching. He refuses to hand back exams and says that to see our graded work that we need to go to his office, but there is almost always a line of people waiting, making it almost impossible to see him in time..| He was not a fan of questions in class because it put him on the spot and would just say see me after class..| He has an accent which is okay. But sometimes his accent drowns out what he's trying to get across so you just blank out..| Occasionally had a condescending attitude towards students when speaking with students during class time and in office hours. Wasn't great at answering questions in class. Would often tell student who asked the question to speak to him after class when the question and answer would have benefited the whole class..| very poorly.| no comment.| terrible.| He never responded to emails. I had even been to his office to talk to him and I'll ask if he received my emails and he actually told me that he does not answer emails. He was always available in his office though to answer questions and I had been to see him a lot this semester..| ok.| terrible.| exam schedule and location was shady and not upfront. emails were sometimes unresponsive.| His communication was better one on one than in class..| In the classroom, he did a good job of going through the material and was available after class to talk to.  Outside of class, I know students had problems with the instructor not responding to emails..| Very poorly..| There was very little communication between the class and Dr. Farajian. I believe that observing his communication with certain students who attempted to voice their questions or concerns forced students to keep their questions to themselves, which in return killed the class participation..| good communication.| Email is probably the worst form of communication to use with Dr. Farajian. Getting a response was very difficult. However, if you went to his office hours he was much more responsive to your questions and concerns..| He did fine.| horribly, very often said there was homework but then wouldnt post it in time so he had to extend it..| He mostly communicated verbally in the classroom. His communication was not bad. He did keep changing dates for assignments though..| He communicated pretty well out of class other than the one time he waited until part way through the day to cancel class..| He was vague and cryptic describing the requirements for projects and insisted that any misunderstanding was the fault of the students..| He did as well as anyone else reading straight from a textbook..| No response to emails..| not very well",2017 Fall

It was more beneficial to have the book in front of you and read along to what he was discussing..| not at all.| no.| Sometimes but it was really simple and straight forward.| unorganized.| Organization is not his strong suit.   I am used to more presentation than the projector work he did. If it was not for the in class participation, I think I could have done most of the work on my own at home (e.g. definitions, example problems) the useful content was his derivation and inclass clues to some of the things he felt were important to learn..| yes.| Just followed exactly as the book word for word but somehow managed to make that unorganized..| The content and lectures were organized in the fact that the routine was the same everyday; Dr. Farajian was late to class, he would open his book and begin reading from where we left off. However, not all material was covered and the amount of material we covered would range from day to day..| yes.| Lectures and content were organized for the most part..| yes.| not at all.| Not at all.

1069,ME 3310,Amir Farajian,Question 8,"no.| I would strongly recommend a recitation section for this course, I feel like it would greatly improve the students understanding of the subject..| Gets very frustrated and likes to argue when students have questions about material that he doesn't want to answer during class..| Thermodynamics is a hard course in general so why would wright state not have a recitation for this course. Also there should be more teacher options for thermodynamics..| This isn't a terrible class, but definitely needs some improvement. Exams weren't reflective of the range of material covered in that section. Only a couple topics covered for a very large amount of content covered in class. Expectations from students for this course are not comparable to credit hours associated with this class.  This class definitely didn't seem like a priority to the instructor because he was usually late to class, didn't return any grades in a timely manner, etc..| He should be seriously reviewed and evaluated to see if he is fit to teach.| I wish I could get my money back for this class because it was a waste of time and money.| I can tell it was his first time teaching, disappointed I paid lots of money for such bad teachers. Shame on the engineering dept for cutting sections of everything, and making classes so big due to their debt while the students suffer.| teach better next time.| bad prof.| Nope.| Amir Farajian should not be a professor at Wright State University. He gives WSU a bad name and makes students feel as though they have wasted their money..| I felt the class was more challenging because of the professor than the content..| no.| Terrible teacher.| I am writing this evaluation in the hopes that both Dr. Farajian and the Dean of Engineering will truly read this evaluation. I do believe that Dr. Farajian's attitude, knowledge, and efforts should not be accepted at Wright State University and my experience in his class has made me struggle with continuing my education at Wright State. However, I have had many great professors at Wright State and I will not allow Dr. Farajian's class to reflect on the entire Engineering Department..| Yes, the content of thermo 1 is broad, exams reviews should be made specific on the particular kinds of question that will be asked on the exam. Recitations should also be added to the lecture to aid student success..| As frustrating as this semester has been, I think Dr. Farajian is a good professor. There has just been a general level of frustration for the students in the class with him. I don't think Thermodynamics I should ever be less than an hour long class. There is far too much content to cover for the classes to be 55 minutes long. If I'm honest, I wish I had taken my money to Sinclair over the summer and done the class. I've heard nothing but good things for Thermodynamics from people who took it at Sinclair. I feel as if our school should too have that reputation for being the go-to for these kinds of classes. Thanks for reading and considering my criticisms..| no.| i would highly recommend evaluating him as a professor because it has ruined alot of peoples views in my class of wright state and a large majority are talking about transferring because of this experience.| Thermodynamics needs a recitation. In class, all we learned were concepts. There was an occasional question at the end of class which we were supposed to solve in groups. The exam had one conceptual question and two problems to solve. I did not like how the exams did not represent what we learned in class. If there were a recitation, then we could learn how to solve the problems and more people would have a strong understanding and pass the class..| There were some people in the class that disrespected the professor. People believed taht he did not do well teaching and preparing us for the exams. However, I did fine on the exams without studying much just by paying attention and writing all of the equations from class on my allowed cheat sheet. He is not a terrible professor. He is pretty okay as a professor..| It would be more productive to have the text(which was infinitely more helpful than Amir Farajian)  for the class be an assigned reading and take two midterms and a final just based on that than to sit through Amir Farajian's slow and lazy regurgitation of the book. It was extremely apparent that the requirements for the project were so vague and unhelpful because they were hastily and thoughtlessly assembled. I would much rather take this class with a student in thermo 2 than with Amir Farajian..| He seemed like a nice guy at least..| no",2017 Fall
1070,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"The professor taught directly from the book and was not very good at explaining concepts in terms that were easy to comprehend. Tests were mainly derivations that I personally do not feel we were prepared for. The class range for exams was 30-100 % and there was less than 15 people in this class. Homework did not make sense, and class structure was hard to follow since notes were drawn all over the place on a projector screen. Numerical examples given by the professor were not helpful. His syllabus is not clear. More on that in the next section. He would ask the class if what he said made sense, and most of the time classmates did not know what to ask to understand the material. I feel as if I learned nothing, and had to jump through so many hoops for this class because of the Instructor. He is a very smart person, but he is not an understandable instructor..| excellent..| Low. Most of class was spent doing conceptual and not much practical application was done. The low number of homework assignments didn't help. I felt really lost on the exams because they didn't seem to have much relation to what went on in class. I don't feel like I learned a lot in this class..| Honestly, I did learn about four laws of thermodynamics and how they apply to different systems, but it was just a basic understanding.  When going in great detail in this class, many of my classmates and I were completely dumbfounded.  It is difficult material.  If the exams were easier, I would feel much more comfortable taking this class.  I always felt like I was lagging behind and didn't quite grasp all of the topics discussed..| The instructor is very intelligent, but the effectiveness of his teaching in thermodynamics of materials is hit or miss.  The majority of the class was spent deriving equations which we rarely ever used, and is almost entirely copied word for word, letter for letter, from the book, which is not a very good book to begin with.  If you are unable to understand the book, he offers nothing extra in teaching the subject. Following along with his lectures in the book will help understand what he is doing, but it does not really teach thermodynamics well..| Not effective. His lectures were just him writing the book on the board with no further explanation. The entire class regularly discussed how they haven't actually learned much of anything and expressed how they will avoid him like the plague in further coursework. He basically only taught theory and never worked through examples. All of WSU engineering experience has been learning the why, and then working through problems until we understand how to solve stuff we may encounter. He just had us write derivations all day and that was pretty much it..| Awful. Taught straight from the book. The book was already hard to understand and him teaching the same method did not help in my learning. This is my least favorite class that I have taken during my entire college career due to the fact that I did not understand what the material throughout the entire semester..| Moderately effective. Feel as if I have to teach myself or not understand..| I, and to my knowledge, nobody in the class, really understand the material. Like, we are all still confused about entropy at equilibrium. The professor is clearly smart and knows what he's talking about, but he is not great at communicating that information..| Dr. Farajian is an amazing professor. The best part in his teaching, he explains the basics so well.",2017 Fall
1071,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 2,"I think that valuable information is missing from his syllabus about group projects. Based on what the syllabus says, he did not evaluate group projects correctly. Only after the assignment,did he elaborate what was actually required. Which was not mentioned in the syllabus..| good.| Yes.| Not exactly.  It was much more lax than I anticipated..| Yes, however, the syllabus is very vague, and many groups did not understand what the expectations even were, mainly for the papers and presentations we had to complete before every exam. As an example, there is no outline for what a ""good poster presentation"" is, however you are graded on the poster presentation as if you know how to deliver one already..| sure..| No. Never gave any feedback on work. Would take 4-6 to grade anything. Very unorganized class. The syllabus was poorly written and hard to understand what was being asked to do. The exams are nothing like the class or the material in the book. There should be more prep for the exam because we usually have no idea what to study for the exam, the worked out numerical examples are nothing like the exam. Some times there were sections of material that we were told would be on the exam and it would never be on the exams..| Not really. Was very lost most of the time when it came to his grading and evaluating..| Possibly. We never get feedback on our work..| Yes he did.",2017 Fall
1072,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 3,"No, he was even late to tests, and did not have tests prepared. That was not fair to us, nor appropriate..| yes.| Aside from being late for the midterm exams (like, really, the only classes you were late for were the exams? come on) yes he was on time and used the full class time.| During lecture, yes.  There was a time when he was 25 minutes late to an exam, and we were still supposed to turn it in at the end of the set class period.  That was a bad day..| The instructor was late on occasion, due to him having another class 10 minutes before our class starts.  During our first mid-term, the instructor was 30 minutes late to class, and did nothing to help students complete the mid-term in the shortened time given to us due to his absence..| No. He was 5-20 minutes late for every single class and was 30 minutes late for one of our exams and then criticized the class for not getting it done with 30 minutes less time..| Yes. Usually used entire class for teaching.| Routinely, yes. Was late but it was because of another class of his going over..| Class started on time when we didn't have exams. During tests class would start 10-20 minutes late..| I think there were two occasions he didn't start the class on time, it's not because he was irresponsible but he was discussing with students from  the previous class. So that's totally cool.",2017 Fall
1073,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 4,"He would routinely ask if we understood the material, but he never really answered questions in an understandable way, so I resorted not asking and seeking help online after class..| he did it very well.| Answered questions in class.| He talked with us about real world applications of the materials we were learning and will eventually learn..| The instructor asks a lot of questions for the class and wants each student to understand the material, however as I stated before, the material is just deriving equations, not really much actual understanding of the physics or thermo itself..| He didn't really..| None. Did not respond to emails in a timely manner..| Cared enough to go out of his way to make sure my accommodations were met during testing..| He expected us to go out and find information rather than just giving it to us. That would be great if we didn't have other classes and work..| He find different ways of explanation for the same concept to help me understand better.",2017 Fall
1074,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 5,"I honestly did not understand things and was confused by almost everything that was going on. I mainly get As and understand material, but his responses never made sense to me, and even when he would elaborate, it made it more confusing..| very effectively and made sure everything is going well.| Sent out emails with information, told us of homework assignments in class.| In the classroom he communicated effectively.  Outside of the classroom, however, I found it a little difficult to understand everything that was expected..| The instructor took quite a long time to grade and return any homework, papers, or presentations that were done during the semester, however he was available whenever needed via e-mail..| He didn't really teach the material, more like regurgitated the information in the book. The class doesn't really require much out of class communication. If by this you mean ""did he respond to emails?"" then yes he responded actually pretty well..| Not. He is very knowledgeable about the topic but does not know how to teach information to students. He would write every equation from the book (even though most were just the derivations of the final equation). Although this class is mainly about entropy and enthalpy and other thermodynamics, I still do not understand the key concepts of this class. They were never explained in a way that I actually understand, even when asked multiple times..| Well.| Needs better handwriting- at times it is illegible, especially when using the computer.| On a scale of 1 to 10, I would say 7.",2017 Fall
1075,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 6,"I really do not think so. Teaching straight from the book with no supplementing material does not work with his teaching style. He would ask about our intuition on a concept before he had actually taught the concept..| yes.| They seemed to be while in class but we moved slow through them and didn't cover as much material as he wanted too..| In my opinion the lectures were well organized and seemingly came out of the book.  Passed that though, the projects were all over the place..| They are as well organized as the thermodynamics book is, which is not very well..| It was just .writing the book down.| The lectures were straight from the book. Most days the professor would ask the students if he wrote it down correctly as we looked in the book to verify if he was correct. He should know what he is teaching. The class was very hard to follow along and very hard to understand the material..| I knew what chapter and section we were on, but felt as if we focused in on things that did not matter and wasted alot of class time..| I'd guess not, since we are 4 chapters short of where we should be.| yes, It was.",2017 Fall
1076,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 7,"I tried reaching out to him, and some of my questions were answered, but not all of them..| yes.| Yes.| In my experience, no..| Yes, he was available as often as necessary..| Yes..| N/a.| yes.| Yes, he was active.",2017 Fall
1077,ME 3750,Amir Farajian,Question 8,"I honestly think this class could be taught so much better. Evaluate how material is presented. This is hard material. It does not need to be made harder..| nope.| The papers were useless in terms of learning anything. The topics were obscure in terms of actually finding any relevant information about them. You almost made it out to be we needed to be in the lab recording the data instead of trying to find someone else's research on the topic. I mean, ""You can't use that topic, it is mainstream and there is a lot of information on it"" isn't a good reason. We aren't doing ground breaking research in these papers. If someone else hasn't put the information out there, we certainly aren't going to be able to figure it out. We had no idea what was going on and our main goal was to get something on the page. Complete waste of time..| Good guy, knows what he is talking about, but goes into too much detail and needs to me more clear about what is expected, especially when it comes to grading..| I believe the instructor is very intelligent and a good teacher, however the design of the class does not promote learning of the material.  Memorizing and deriving a hundred equations is not an effective way to teach a course that, while math heavy, should also have some understanding of its impact on the real world and their implications.  I hope that in the future more time is spent discussing what the equations describe and how they effect the thermodynamics of materials, and less time writing the same equations 50 times with different assumptions. There is also a very very small amount of the course that is materials related, so i am not sure how it differs from the normal thermodynamics class..| Nice guy, talked to us about how he liked us as a class, but it was very disappointing to spend 15 weeks just transcribing the book to my notes. I think he could be a great professor if he just showed interest in our success and taught at least one example now an then..| If the professor expects us to write a paper/presentation in less than a week ( with all the other classes that we are taking) it should only take him a week to grade it. For every paper it took him 4-6 to grade the papers and wouldn't let us start the next paper until he graded the past paper limiting the time for us to write the next paper. Although he said he gave us requirements for the paper written in the syllabus, it was poorly written and hard to understand that was being ask/what was required the syllabus needs to be rewritten with better parameters for the paper/presentation..| Nothing, thank you.",2017 Fall
1078,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 1,"Not effective.| okay.| good.| Alright he tries but lectures are disorganized and have no real structure to them. I feel as if this class is supposed to be a data analysis class but really is just all over the map with the material that we cover..| Far below standard, could not have been more disappointed in this course's instruction or lack thereof. Poorly executed, did not seem to care if students succeeded in the course or not as long as they understood what data meant. Fine for theoretical practice, but destroying students GPAs because of your poor quality of teaching is shameful. Kindly stop ""teaching"" because most of our class has this same exact viewpoint of your instruction quality. I hope I never have the misfortune of having you for a teacher again..| Class felt pointless to attend. Would go over example problems in class, but not give enough time to write them down. The lab section was too large for only 1 TA and 1 instructer to help during the period..| Not very effective.| Rough. Notes were extremely hard to read and explanations did little help.| poor.| Dr. Jackson can be unorganized at times but overall did a decent job of teaching the subject. He has a lot of practical knowledge which he shares on a normal basis..| m.| the worst class in history. he doesn't know anything about the subject waste time and if your student with color you get picked on and have to prove and show everything you do, for example he always ask them to prove there work and question them and blame them for cheating even if they never did. And he  have threaten more than one student that he will report them and he did that with group and he refused meeting with them,then it was proved that the student didn't cheated but used the pilot file like every other student but unfortunately for him if you not white your cheater till proven not..| He was not very effective. I found it difficult to learn from him because he would go off on a tangent. There were also equations that would have been nice to talk about in class and what they mean. Sometimes we did cover some and sometimes we did not. He was a super nice guy and meant the best but the teaching did not help me what so ever. He said it may have helped to have more LA's and he may have been correct but I am not sure. Our LA did not do much other than when it came to lab help..| Not very effective. Hard to follow. Lecture material was presented as theory first in powerpoint form--good! However, the slides were moved through too quickly to effectively take notes. Often I would get halfway through writing out a concept or transcribing an equation and realize the slide had changed. This would not be a huge issue if the slides were posted on Pilot, but more often than not they were not posted. Example problems were done from the textbook--also good! However, this presented a couple issues. If an example was worked out on the projector, handwriting became an issue. Work was messy, scattered, or nearly illegible at times. If the solution was presented in a printed out problem, the same issue as the powerpoint slides came up: the example was moved through too quickly to take effective notes. And if we were asked to do the problem individually or as a class, either we were not given enough time or a specific solution was never given beyond ""Johnny got 54, but Bill got 229,001. Okay next problem..."".| This was class was the most waste of time I have ever experienced.  I have not learned anything from the course.  A huge waste of money as well..| NOT EFFECTIVE WHAT-SO-EVER.  Class lectures were a complete waste of time.  Nothing was ever really taught, some lectures we were literally told to get out our books and read them.  We then were told to ask questions, he answered NONE of the classes questions, he would try to have us answer each other. (kinda hard to do when no one learning anything.)  He cancelled many classes. HE CHANGED THE WEIGHT OF THE CLASS SECTIONS 3 TIMES!!  Twice the week before finals! His handwriting was so horrible no one could read it. He was so disorganized during lectures no one could follow.  When he assigned homework he never posted it anywhere, he would write it on the board for 5 seconds, then remove it ( no one could read what was assigned). Acted like you were dumb if you asked a question, and would not answer. Terrible class, learned nothing, Glad it is almost over..| Relatively effective. He makes sure that the students understand the key principles taught in the course in the way that they apply to real life scenarios. His ability to teach students how to solve the problems for the course is lacking however. He's great one on one though. Perhaps he could just go over how to do problems step by step to aid in student ability to work through problems presented on homework and exams..| Non-existent. It was difficult to learn in this class or even follow what was going on. The instructor rambled incessantly which only further added to the disaster which was ME3600-01..| The lecture were very boring.  It seemed like he took a long time on not a lot of material and the students lost interest. On the other hand, he is very willing to listen to any complaints and adjust accordingly..| Good.| Dr. Jackson's teaching was iffy at the best of times. Most of the slideshows I got very little out of. It is telling that the most effective instruction in this course came from fully solved problems projected onto the board. He often gets talking about tangential topics that help us little practically or in the course..| Dr. Jackson taught to the syllabus well and covered what was needed for his exams..| Largely ineffective. Lectures are too fast to actually hold any information. Tests are frustrating due to a feeling of being lost for a majority of the lectures. They are fair otherwise. Labs are disorganized. Only having one TA made the labs a mess..| Dr. Jackson was somewhat effective in his teaching. There never really seemed to be much structure in his lectures, so it was very easy to get lost in his class..| Dr. Jackson was fairly effective. I thought the first half of the semester was rough because I didn't get a good understanding of the material but as the semester went on Dr. Jackson was very effective in his teaching..| He was decently effective.| caring and dedicated professor. Had a rough semester but persevered and did his best teaching job..| i barely understand what he says in class.| The overall effectiveness of the instructor was quite poor. I consider this primarily a consequence of the class format. With 60+ students sitting in a room in Student Success Center, all facing different directions (half of them not facing the instructor), trying to learn math heavy material from a lecturer, to expect any kind of effectiveness is ridiculously optimistic. I personally consider the MME department's apparent ambivalence for this class's section size, room choice, and text, an embarrassment to the college..| Not very effective at all. The way the class is designed is not the best, it should definitely be a lecture hall class. The book that is used in the class has a lot of mistakes in it, not helping with the learning of the material at all. Something always went wrong in lab, to the point where the class grading scale had to be adjusted three times due to a lab not going as planned..| Low effectiveness, lectures were generally ineffective and reading the book provided the same amount of instruction as the professor..| Not effective.| very ineffective.| This instructor was not very effective in teaching the material. We just jumped around to different sections of the book which was hard to follow. Some of the book answers and examples were wrong which made things difficult. Also the things written on the projector were very difficult to read and to follow. He could have done a much better job of Assigning homeworks. He just did them by casual mention in class and never even gave the full details about due dates..| He covered the material verbally and related it to real world situations from his own experiences which was nice..| Much more effective at teaching material when going through examples..| He is not an effective instructor. I did not learn anything from him. I did not understand anything because of the way he teaches. By far the worst professor I have ever had. He goes on rants and does not focus on the topics. He expects the student to know everything. He has favoritism, his favorite students get A's in the labs and the homework. He does not go over problems step by step, if someone yells the right answer, he will move on to the next question. Students have continuously complained about the grading system, the way he teaches, and his overall quality as a teacher. He does not have what it takes to be a professor. Sadly, Wright State has no money to hire a decent professor and begged him to come back to teach. Therefore the students do not have a choice and these evaluations are worthless.",2017 Fall
1079,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 2,"No. The syllabus changed twice to alter how much each assignment was worth for the final grade..| yes.| yes.| His syllabus changed quite often. Grading was liking drawing a number out of a hat for homework..| No. due to lack of preparation and organization, labs were not able to be run, we didnt get our graded assignments back at all, and they were graded harshly but not returned so we never knew what we did wrong..| No. The syllabus grade distributions changed 3 times within the last 2 weeks of class, making it very difficult to evaluate how well you were doing in the course..| Yes.| Yes.| yes.| No.| Yes he did..| no he changed the grading twice. he told us one of labs is not with much at all. the day of lab we didn't have time he told people to wait because he didn't know what to do. till the last minutes in class then helped them and told them you can satay after class and they didn't stay an a hour after class because he didn't know how to do the lab he need it to see how other student will do it first. then the day after he email us and say that lab worth 14% now..| For the most part. He ended up changing some things from the syllabus and the weight distribution of the grades. The material was covered like it said in the syllabus though..| Mostly. Some weighting had to be changed because we essentially skipped a lab we were supposed to do a full report on. This is at no fault of the instructor. Partially faulty equipment is to blame. But this is also due to the fact that we did not have an LA/TA/lab assistant (we needed multiple for such a large lab) present, so the vast majority of the class could not get their equipment to work properly. PLEASE provide more lab assistants or whatever for this class--even if it is just for the lab. It is needed. I would have benefitted. Don't continue cutting funding because your students will suffer the consequences more than anyone else..| No, more than half way through the semester he changes the grading criteria in the syllabus.  These changes ended up hurting us all not helping us.  Than instead of getting our homework back in class we had to make a special trip to the MME dept. to pick it up.  No feedback on the homework on what we did wrong..| no..| yes.| I really have no idea. I have not received but a couple grades back and have no feedback on anything..| For the most part..| well enough.| Yes..| Yes.| The grading scale has changed so many times, but it is not completely his fault. One day, our LabVIEW software was not operating correctly, so as a result, he needed to push back one of our labs. When he pushed it back, he changed the amount of work that needed to be done in that specific lab. Because of this, he needed to change the grading scale so that it would match the amount of work. Overall, our grading scale has changed many times, so the scale in the syllabus is not the same as the final scale. However, I do believe Dr. Jackson is trying to be very fair in the new grading scale, and he is trying to accommodate the needs of the class as best as possible..| Yes, Dr. Jackson followed the syllabus exactly..| To a point yeah.| yes,.| not at all the time.| No. Due to delays caused by lab equipment that wasn't functioning, the final lab requirements were simplified. As a result the instructor altered the weight of each assignment in the class grade. I realize the choice was made in response to unforeseen events, however it borders on unethical to alter the grading structure mid semester..| Yes, and no, simply because we strayed from the syllabus so much. The grader also did not specify why points were taken off on homeworks..| It is unknown because as of this time no labs or homework assignments have been graded or returned to any students..| Sometimes.| yes, but I would have been more prepared for the evaluations if 60% of every class wasn't spent with him struggling and complaining about the projector.| No he changed the grading percentages drastically which was not good. He did this more than once..| He followed and adjusted the grading scale when a lab wont work but other than that he stuck to the original ..| Yes.| No.",2017 Fall

Looking back on my notes and the book, I think that this class would have been easier if we would've followed the book in the order that it is written. I also think that the lectures were not always the most organized. Most of the time, it seemed like he would come in and just wing it..| Yes, the lectures were well organized..| Yes and no, and that's because of lab equipment not working and personal issues the instructor had to deal with, both of which are not his fault..| Could stand to be more organized.| not at ALL, the labs wasn't organized he had to reduce the percentage for the last lab report from 20% to 10%, an splits it on exams and hw..| No..| No, lecture was always all over the place, and whatever examples the professor wrote on the projector were always very hard to read..| Very unorganized, specifically laboratories were organized very poorly to the point that one or two labs had to be scrapped and two hours of student's time was wasted because the professor did not attempt the lab himself or did not explain the procedure correctly..| No.| absolutely not, but it is hard to tell if it was his fault or the book's.| No it was hard to follow what was going on..| Yes very well organized by chapter.| The lectures lacked structure which hurt me. The book used I felt was not good for teaching this course. There were too many equations to draw from and not enough examples provided in the book..| No. It was very disorganized and did not make any sense. It displayed how much the professor graded you as to how much he liked you.",2017 Fall
1084,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 7,"Yes.| yes.| yes.| Yes.| No. Unhelpful in the extreme. Don't know what your time was spent in your office doing, but it clearly wasnt grading assignments for speedy return.| N/a.| Yes.| Sure.| yes.| Yes.| Yes he was..| no.| He was not always in his office hours but he would be if we let him know we would be stopping by..| Absolutely. Due to an athletics conflict, I had to miss a midterm. Dr. Jackson was very understanding and worked with me to find a time I could make up the exam. No complaints here..| No, he was not..| yes he was.| Reasonably, but he wasn't always helpful. Sometimes consulting the professor left one more confused then when he started. Other times one was told the answer but not explained why..| Yes.| yes.| Yes..| yes.| Yes, Dr. Jackson was readily available and responded quickly to emails..| Yes, whenever I needed to meet with him he was available and always willing to meet.| yes.| yes.| He was responsive with emails..| Yes he was..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes.| No. He was never available.",2017 Fall
1085,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"no.| No.| For the love of all that is holy, if you have even a shred of respect for the students who pay to take classes at this university, either up your standard of operation by an extreme amount, or do everyone a favor and stop teaching..| The textbook was written very poorly and would recommend attempting to find a different one for this course in the future.| Dr. Jackson needs more support from TAs, but also needs to refine his lecture material.| Nope.| did not get what I paid for..| No.| No, overall a decent semester with some hiccups but Dr. Jackson was very aware of that and considerate of that..| i wish wright state start viewing what he's teaching.| From my experience with Allen Jackson; I would not take him again and I can't believe the university has kept him as a professor here.  If you're going to fire anyone it should be him..| HO HO HO, so happy to be getting out of this class..| Great guy. I just wish he prepared us better for exams. You could do the homework and study really hard and get torn apart on the exams. Many found the wording very tough and the problems took far too much time to solve in the given time unless you knew exactly what to do immediately. I found myself running out of time on exams and getting a bad grade even though I knew what to do. I just couldn't work fast enough. Some did not have this issue however. He was fantastic at making sure that we knew why the work was important.  Overall a great person and someone you can learn a lot from..| I understand this class was understaffed which created great difficulties for the Professor and although I sympathized, I don't feel this is ample excuse for how poorly this class was run. There were several issues with the lab equipment, but these would not have been as dire if the professor didn't routinely spend 30-45 mins talking before starting lab. This in itself furthered the issues and added frustration..| Dr. Jackson seems like a pretty good guy, but his instruction is more than a little lacking. This was easily one of the most ineffective courses I have ever taken. I tend to be a straight-A student, but I often struggled even trying to grasp many of the concepts in this class because of the poor explaining. The labs' structure fell apart because of insufficient instructions and poor equipment. If this wasn't a required class, I absolutely would never have taken it. If I had to take it again, I would absolutely look for a different professor. Again, nothing against Dr. Jackson personally, I just can't say that he was an effective professor in any regard..| Slower lectures and more problems worked in conjunction with the lecture itself instead of just doing them for review would have been very helpful.| No..| I heard terrible things about this class before the semester started but now, I don't think the class was that bad at all. I learned a lot and had fun this semester!.| Appreciated him going through with the class even though he did not have to, especially with what is going on in his life at the moment. He did as good of a job that he could have with everything that was going on..| The class should be restructured, a different, more correct and clear book should be used, and some of the the labs should be redone, along with the lab manual..| I would not recommend this instructor to anyone, however since he is the only person to teach this course students do not have a choice and have to sit through his mandatory lectures despite the fact that the same amount of learning and instruction could be gained if a student merely read the book. His laboratories were the worst part of the class, he would regularly come in 10-15 minutes late and provide a procedure which could not be followed unless someone had extensive experience in signal analysis or have used LabView extensively. As this was my first time ever using LabView it was nearly impossible for me to complete the lab by myself and had to receive help from other students. Additionally, there were times when the lab was cancelled because a large number of the students could not complete the lab due to the labs being very vague..| No.| the strain gage lab was a bigger disaster than the Iraq war.| Thanks for the good semester. In the future make sure the pockets of rude people get broken up so your lectures can be heard..| The class size was too large with too few TA's for effective teaching and help for students..| No, because students opinions do not matter with the engineering department.",2017 Fall

1089,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 4,"The instructor would ask about any odd results in a lab..| yes.| The lab we were working in is way too small it was hard to see what Dr. Jackson was even working with due to all of the students including myself being in the lab..| Yeah he would answer questions unrelated to the class if you asked.| yes.| perfect.| yes, give us a lot of example he really wanted everybody to learn not just even pass the class.| He wanted to make sure you gained something from the labs, and that the conclusions that you came to were logical and accurate..| available for questions outside of class time..| He would make sure we understood the material. He would have group meetings to discuss data to make sure we knew what we were learning..| Had students re-do portions of labs in which the recorded data didn't make sense. Gave them a chance to learn from their mistakes and know what to look for in the future..| He was available outside of class for questions, and was present while the students conducted the experiments.",2017 Fall
1090,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 5,"In class communication was very effective. Out of class communication was effective, but occasionally unavailable..| no.| Extremely well. Once I emailed him a question and he very emailed me back with a very detailed response that helped me with the lab.| well he responded both to email and in his office hours.| yes.| strong.| even though we don't have to attend the class he will be there for anyone who wants a help. for out the class you can email him or go to his office hours.| Very well..| Okay. He often times forgot what he said in office hours..| Great. Dr. Jackson was available outside of class, whether in his office or online.

He was in the lab or in his office whenever he was needed. He promptly replied to emails and answered any questions..| Yes.| yes",2017 Fall
1093,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 8,"The removal of assigned groups at the end of the semester could have been handled better. This semester, nearly all groups formed for the first such experiment made plans to be grouped during the last such experiment. An individual with poor group members is thus likely to have those same group members during both experiments, a poor position to be in..| No.| My favorite lab I've taken at WSU.| no.| nup.| At the beginning of the semester, the professor stated that there would be assigned groups for the labs. What this turned into was him putting students that he deemed as bright with students that he knew struggled some (since he had had most of the students in previous courses). This had good intentions, but what it meant for the bright students in most cases would be for them to do the entire paper. As being a so called bright student, I would read the parts of the report that some other students contributed and it was often wrong, confusing, and/or written in poor English. I was then left to the choice of interpreting their work and trying to fix it, or just to redo the section all together, with the latter being the faster option. This turned into me just doing the entire paper. Granted, after much griping from students, he did change it to where the groups were chosen by the students..| Wish the projects were graded more promptly. It was difficult to know if the work I was doing was acceptable. Lab manual does not do a good job of explaining what is required for the report (outdated requirements)..| Dr. Jackson is great. I appreciate the things he taught in this class, the helpfulness he provided and just being an overall nice guy to have as a professor..| No",2017 Fall
1094,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 1,"Dr. Jackson made this class much more difficult than it had to be.  He is a very nice gentleman, but generally speaking this class would be better if you got a grad student to make videos of the test procedures that we could watch.  Going to class to watch the procedure was usually a waste of time, except for the fact that the labs were poorly written.  Overall we got very little feedback in the class and our grades were much lower than I believe they should be..| gd.| very.| very effective",2017 Fall
1095,ME 4620,Allen Jackson,Question 2,"The labs need to be rewritten in such a way that the students know what information is expected from the lab.

I realize that this happens in the workplace, but barring union involvement, there are typically repercussions to not doing work on a team project, i.e. getting fired.  There were no repercussions in this class regardless of the individual's work ethic.  Overall a terrible class with very little utility..| gd.| no.| no additional comments. Just would like some of the assignments to be graded a little quicker, but overall was a good experience.",2017 Fall
1102,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"The instructor covered a lot of material in the short amount of time. However, I struggled to learn with his teaching style. The activities were helpful but sometimes the lectures would be dry and hard to follow. I learned more from the reading and annotating than I usually did from the class periods..| pretty good.| Dr. S was a very effective professor. I learned a lot from him this semester..| extremely knowledgeable on the subject matter, was enthusiastic when teaching, total effectiveness however was just ok, the entire class when it wasnt a quiz day and even having attendance worth part of your grade half the class would be absent..| I feel like Professor Srinivasan had very little to do with my learning in this class.  Everything was based on outside reading and group work..| the instructor is very nice and explains the material very well.| Dr. S is a terrible professor.  He lacks any sort of teaching ability or knowledge of how to relate things to students.  Throughout this semester I have had an extremely hard time following along with the ""lectures"" that he gives on occasion..| I haven't really learned all that much, the quizzes were not worth a large enough portion of my grade to put effort into studying for, compared to their difficulty..| very effective.| Not very effective. Hard to hear him in the large classroom setting even with the microphone turned on. The teaching style he utilized wasn't exactly the most effective..| Difficult to understand.  rushed through topics, did not take the time to make sure the students understood the material.| Not very at all. I felt like we were just googling things as a class this semester (literally, we're told to use the internet and outside resources for the group work). Also, I felt like I was just in an online class, and I honestly would've probably learned more if it was. I felt like too much of the course was digitized to be effective, especially in such a conceptual subject like Materials Science. I would've liked more instruction from you as an engineering professional, not just reading these online powerpoint slides. I'm coming to Wright State to interact with engineering professionals, not take an online course. I felt like there just needed to be more of your presence as an instructor, not a moderator for our ""self/group learning."" Please fix this!.| The instructor himself understood the material very well, but in my opinion was not very effective at teaching the material. The lecture's were hard to follow and dry, and if it was clear that the students didn't understand the material he wouldn't explain it further..| Very knowledgeable, bland lectures and sometimes tedious..| He was good..| He did a good job lecturing. This course was mostly a participation grade. Also, it was at eight in the morning and we mostly sat and listened to him lecturing. It was very difficult for the class to sit still and stay awake while the professor was lecturing as he does not have a loud, attention-grabbing voice. I did not like our online textbook. The annotations we did in our online book were graded very harshly. During the beginning of the course I thought it was impossible to get a 100% on one of them, but I managed a few 100%s. The annotations were worth 20% of our grade so it was a big deal. Also, annotations made learning harder because we were supposed to learn from each other. However, most students had a poor understanding of the concepts so annotations often taught the wrong way of looking at problems. Overall, annotations did not aid in learning, they hindered it..| He was not the greatest..| I'd give him a 6/10.| He tried to teach the class, but it was not interesting enough to pay attention..| The instructor was overall ineffective..| Dr. Srinivasan was not very effective..| This professor seems to care somewhat about student learning however, in class he did not teach very well.  He would give problems for us to do in class without explaining how to do them and then he would not give us the solution to the problems after we finished. This left many of us very confused and we never knew if our solutions were correct or not..| He rarely lectures and when he does often primarily reads off the slides. There is little direction on the subject, seemingly random facts are given though..| instructor knows the material well but the structure of the class gave no incentive to actually learn the material..| I felt like his class was not fair at all. The group mattered more in his class. The final project I have done it all by myself just because my group didn’t want to help at all. They got the same grade as me and they didn’t do any work. This class wasn’t fair at all, I felt like this class should have been an online course..| fairly effective though a majority of learning was expected to take place outside of class; this method would have been effective in an active learning class if lecture time was spent working examples, but the time was spent on lectures.| The instructor was rather ineffective, to my experience..| Good.| Not very. I feel I have no new knowledge on the subject, however, I will receive an A or B in the class. That is a fail on the instructors end..| He is a kind man who shows passion for what he teaches. If you make an honest effort in the class, it is easy to succeed..| Lectures are dry and difficult to follow. Did most of my learning outside of class..| Not very effective. He always has his mic too low so it is difficult to hear. He provides great practice problems for each chapter but does not provide solutions to them and does not go over the solutions in class..| Absolutely ineffective.| Not very effective.  The class does not solidify any information whatsoever. It requires minimal effort and reading the book does not mean the students know the information off hand at any moment.  Lectures are poor as we go through examples and then don't always go through solutions..| Effectiveness was mediocre.| Instructor was not very effective in conveying the material. In the beginning of the semester a lot of time was wasted.  I learned the material better from online sources/slides from other schools etc..| horrible, didn't learn a single thing.| Moderately effective.| He is not a very good teacher.| Overall, I do not feel he was a very effective professor. Almost everything I learned this semester was just from me reading the book. His lectures were very vague, and did not answer many questions students asked of him. I have put a lot of hard work and effort into this class to make sure I get an A in it, but I know many people who slacked off. They did not actually read the book, and did not learn hardly anything; yet they will still be receiving the same letter grade as me due to the set up of his class. Hard work and understanding the content do not equate to success in his class. Overall, this class and the professor was just full of disappointment over and over again..| Used the whole lecture to go over the course material which helped in understanding the content..| sufficient.| Ineffective at lecturing and teaching content..| Dr. Srinivasan was not as effective an instructor as I would have hoped.  Though he gave a good overview of the subject (which is, to be fair, a big subject to cover) I don't feel like I got as secure a grounding in the subject from his lectures alone.  The homework was a good way to see how the concepts could be applied, but I still felt that, in some areas, he could definitely have been more effective..| Lets TAs do most of the work for him, lectures briefly and then expects students to know what to do.  Class is set up so it is easy to get a good grade and learn nothing.  Almost never responds to emails unless the same email is sent multiple times.| Decent..| -.| Not effective at all. His course was centered around groups. Did not allow people to learn. His 'lectures' were terrible and were very difficult to pull any information from..| very effective.| He was fine",2017 Fall
1103,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 2,"Yes, the professor followed his expectations that he had listed in the syllabus. He graded according to the listed scales and was good at saying if there were any schedule changes..| yes.| His syllabus was very clear on all the grading policies and class policies and he enforced them in class when needed..| yes.| yes.| Yes.| yes and no.  Dr. S used an online program to grade our book annotations.  This online program was very finicky and often the grades would change without our or his doing..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| yes.| Nothing deviated from the syllabus, unfortunately..| The material was graded and weighted exactly per the syllabus..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes..| Kinda.| Yes.| Yes.| Yes..| There was no official syllabus, but rather a series of emails that were sent before the semester began..| Yes, all of our work was graded as expected..| Yes, he accurately followed hos syllabus..| yes.| No, in his class the group matters more than the individual grade. I really got screwed in this class when it came to grading. He did follow the syllabus, but he was not fair at all. He made the quizzes really hard..| yes, grading followed the syllabus as expected.| There was no course syllabus to derive expectations from. What was provided instead were a series of emails blanket addressed to the students, which theoretically contained the information that would have been contained within a syllabus. In practice, however, critical pieces of information, such as assignment schedules or the overall grading scale, were not included or included in fractured forms that had to be pieced together, and by having the information separated into multiple locations the difficulty of actually locating the information one was looking for became a much more difficult exercise than it should have been..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes.| The first reflection was not graded according to the syllabus, but subsequent assignments were..| Yes.| Yes.| Yes, but expectations are extremely low and pathetic..| Yeah.| Yes.| for the most part he didn't evaluate us.| yes.| He followed the syllabus.| Yes.| yes.| Yes.

He always talking the whole time during class time and when I email him outside of class, e never responds at all. This is something that I really hated..| very effective with email communication, not all that effective with engaging students in communication during lectures.| Communication was poor. Soft-spoken as he was, it was difficult to hear him in the classroom when his microphone was functioning, and impossible to hear him when it ceased to function, which occurred frequently. Being in a scale-up classroom, it was also extremely difficult to hear over the conversations of students which were supposed to happen as part of the course's proper functioning. Communication outside of the classroom was nearly nonexistent, with the only communications received outside of class being the 'dear students' emails that were sent in place of a proper syllabus..| Well.| Always clear instructions..| Very well.| Hard to understand him, instructions often confusing. Many emails over the same topic..| He answered emails very well.

I emailed him one time this semester and he never responded..| Gave us information out of class by email to update us on class information..| as well as he can be expected to in such a ridiculously large class.| Communication was attempted in the class room..| He communicated with a number of emails, and was reasonably effective at communication..| Very well..| -.| Decent.| very effective",2017 Fall
1107,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"The course and lectures were very organized. The professor was prepared for the class and understood the material well..| yes, everything was laid out on pilot.| Yes, he posted all his lecture slides on pilot and we always knew what was going to be talked about in class that day..| yes.| Yes, but most of the class was spent figuring things out with our groups instead of lecturing..| Yes the material is very organized. and the lecture is very organized..| not at all.  Dr. S did not prepare well for lectures.  The lecture slides were usually out of order.  Dr. S would assign problems and give us minutes to work on a them..| Yes? and no, I don't really understand how students are supposed to learn anything in this course.| yes.| They didn't really seem like it..| Very rushed.  Would have been a much better class if we had more time to understand everything..| I'd like to say that this summer I was very excited about this course, but I'd now like to say that I am SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. Almost all of the resources for this class were online. Persuall and the annotation assignments were probably the worst thing to happen to this class. I actually despise ebooks, and I was very saddened to here that it was required for this course. About 3/4 of the way through the semester and failing almost every quiz, I checked out another edition of this textbook from the library, and I have to say that my understanding of the material significantly increased. I learned more with my sessions with the hard copy of the textbook than with my time on Persuall. I feel like this is the case with several students. You really shouldn't force your students to learn with an ebook, because most students don't have much experience with them, and I don't think it's your place to try and force that upon them during my time in this class. Instead of trying to learn Structures and Properties of Materials, I'm now trying to learn how to use an ebook AND Structures and Properties of Materials. You should just require the textbook, not the form it's offered. I often felt handicapped with this because I learn better with hard-copies but I'm literally required to use it for our annotation grades. The annotations were also a waste of my time. To get a good score on them you had to write about a paragraph for each one, which leads to five per annotation which is the equivalent of a small essay per assignment, which is due like twice a week. These would take me on average about 2 hours to complete, and diverted my attention from the textbook readings. I spent way more time trying to get a good grade on the annotations than I did actually reading the textbook. . . JUST STOP USING PERSUALL and assign chapter readings so we can actually digest the material. ***I suggest that you get rid of Persuall and the annotation grades and just highlight specific reading assignments. If the sole purpose of Persuall was to to hold students accountable for the reading assignments, just do a small concept quiz at the end of each class over the readings and lecture. This will hold students accountable for the readings and will actually get them to come to class. AND the TAs might actually have something to do/grade (the TAs were practically useless, they just kind of twiddled their thumbs the whole semester and didn't really help). Also, I think you should do more of a traditional active learning environment. I'm suggesting you restructure the course in this way: 1. Stop the requirement of the ebook and banish Perusall. Just require the textbook for reading! 2. Replace Perusall with assigned readings, and test students on these readings at the end each class with a small quiz. 3. At the beginning of class, spend about 10 minutes working out a group problem that is graded by the TAs (so that way we actually interact with the TAs), and then lecture the rest of the time up to the quiz. 4. STOP DOING CLICKER QUIZZES!!! These had so many issues. Just have them be periodic written tests and have the TAs grade them... 5. Just have regular homework assignments and stop the ""reflection"" idea. No one sincerely does this... 6. If you decide to make attendance a grade, you need to include a series of drops in the semester for attendance and other assignments. This way you can stop dealing with people's excuses as to why they were ""late."" (Also, it didn't help that this class was a huge 8:00am lecture, so attendance was highly dependent on traffic and other factors) * I spent a significant amount of time thinking about this because of my level of disappointment. I was actually considering getting into MSE before this course, and the functionality of this classroom made me abandon that idea **.| Yes..| yes.| Yes..| Yes. He had everything ready to go even before the start of class..| Not at all..| Yes.| Yes, they followed the syllabus really well, despite the schedule needing to be changed near the end of the semester..| No. After only 2 weeks the instructor assigned a reading on a chapter that would only be seen in-depth until november..| Yes.| His lectures did not match up well with the in class problems..| The course content and lectures were never on the same page, the out of class homework never focused on what the lectures were about because they were always 2-3 weeks ahead due to how closely packed they were..| yes.| It was not organized at all, we kept jumping all over the place. This is somethings that I really hated. We kept moving from the front to the back of the book and backwords, it was really bad..| yes the course content was logically organized.| Organization of the class was poor for the medium in which it was used. I feel that the organization of the class was more intended for a regular lecture hall, and then retrofitted at the last minute to attempt to use the scale-up classroom method. Long stretches of lecturing were suddenly interrupted for the students to do a single problem with minimal explanation of the procedures necessary, and then almost immediately whip-lashed back into lecturing. The Teaching Assistants, which are one of the critical components of the scale-up method's proper function, were often not of assistance, and in some situations actually worsened the student's understanding of the situation. Recitations were quite often a complete joke, and did nothing of actual use for the students, something that the students quickly picked up on. Between all things, the class was an excellent example of a dysfunctional classroom. I would suggest, if you decide to try to tool the class more towards a scale-up design, to contact Dr. Randy Mieskoski from the Physics department. His 'See One, Do One, Teach One' setup has had a great amount of success with scale-up classrooms, and perhaps his method might be of assistance in reorganizing this class..| Reading assignments did not usually line up with in class materials..| Yes..| Yes.| yes, presented from lecture slides.| Yes.| Mildly..| Average.| yah.| Not at all.  Although sorted in a logical way, the content within the each lecture topic was disconnected and did not coney to the students.  The information was presented not taught.

1109,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"The professor did a good job of covering the required material. At the beginning of the semester he should go into more detail about how to do annotations and explain what parts need read of the book. He should also make sure to take the time to actually answer the problems that we do in class. For some activities we did in class, it would seem like he would have us do them and then never actually go over the answer. Overall, the professor did expose us to a lot of information about materials and was an organized professor..| Nothing about Dr. S but the TA I was assigned this semester for recitation and for in class was not very helpful. She didn't understand half of what was going on and she definitely played favorites within her recitation group. I feel like my grade has suffered because she would never come to our table to answer questions or help during recitation. There was one table in particular she stuck to and would actually sit with them for most of the semester..| nope.| no, Thank you.| Dr. S was absolutely terrible and I can say with complete confidence that his teaching is not effective.  Throughout the semester Dr, S and his Learning assistants have been extremely rude and degrading to everybody.  this class has taught me nothing at all and i hope to never have to take his class again.  He needs to be fired for being incompetent.  My learning assistant was terrible and was rude.  he routinely called us stupid and would not help out when asked..| Kimia was the worst LA ever. She confused me even more. Told us wrong information multiple times and spend 30 minutes per recitation looking at her laptop trying to figure out how to solve the problem. Was not prepared and did not have enough knowledge to LA for this course..| Nope.| Overall, I'm disappointed. Please read my long comments above and take them into consideration. I've spent a significant amount of time on that because I actually care and was troubled about this course in general. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. Thanks for reading..| N/a.| He was good..| I think the class was fair except for the computer grader for our annotations. When using clickers on quizzes I would have liked to see my answers to all the quiz questions side by side with the correct answers to the quiz questions. That would be more meaningful to me than just a grade. I also did not like having to buy a digital copy of the book. I prefer paper copies so that I can make notes in them of things that I think are important. The online book was cluttered with everyone's mandatory comments..| No.| His LA's were highly ineffective. They did not have basic knowledge of the material covered and were difficult to understand when they did have answers..| His TA’s seemed more confused than the students often times. Also, things were never well explained. It left his students very confused..| no.| This class was really bad, he talks all the time in the class and when u have a question, he never responds at all. I felt like this class should be an online course. I didn’t like this class at all, he always made me feel that I wanted to sleep. Also his accent made it hard to understand. The group work matters much more than the individual grade.| the class would be better off restructured as a lecture class, because that's how it was taught but not how it was graded/activities were planned. I did however like the concept of group and individual quizzes, and how the homework was discussed in groups and then reflected on rather than graded for accuracy. The main issue I had with the class was the very high grade weighting on Perusall when the material was going to be lectured on in the next class anyway; there was little motivation to do the reading and hardly anyone did the reading, just did enough annotations to get the grade. That 20% of the grade depended on this seemed ridiculous to me; I believe there should have been much more weight on the quizzes and less on Perusall.| This class was quite possibly the worst class I have experienced at Wright State. My reasoning for this is listed below. A large portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were annotations of the textbook, which was required to be purchased through a particular third-party site. These annotations were extended response sentences, and were intended to make the students analyze the material to gain insights into what the text was covering. This wasn't a particularly bad idea in theory, but the implementation of the concept left much to be desired. All grading of responses was done by the third party website's automated grading algorithm, with the 'best 5' responses determining the student's grade on the assignment. Those with a knowledge of what software is currently capable of would realize that algorithmic approaches to parsing English sentences is a seriously difficult task, which still has not been adequately solved by dedicated research teams. As such, there were serious holes in the algorithm that were quickly identified and exploited by the students. There were multiple instances in which students would annotate vocabulary words within the section, and respond with a definition pulled directly from an internet search for the word. These responses would receive full marks for the assignment, despite not actually having any analysis of the material done on the part of the student. Additionally, due to the minimum responses required for an assignment, giving actual analytical answers became a time consuming process, while students who exploited the system were finished in under ten minutes, and often with better grades. All of this was visible to the student body, as the annotations were public to those within a student's division of the class, which equated to about one sixth of the students in attendance. Another significant portion of the assignments (20% of the final grade) were homework assignments. There were five assignments across the semester, with half of each grade being completion, and the other half being a guided reflection sheet designed to encourage self-analysis, and also act as a feedback measure to the faculty. The problems came in that there was no actual accountability required in the process. Assignments were not checked for correctness at any stage along the process, meaning that students did not receive feedback as to whether or not they had properly understood or implemented the concepts. There was often little support in the actual lectures for the calculations required in the assignments, with the lectures focusing almost entirely on theory and disregarding calculations, which left students to fend for themselves in trying to learn how to complete the assignments. There were multiple instances of dishonest behavior when completing assignments, with at least one instance in which a student was taking answers for their homework off of Chegg, (a website designed for copying answers for homework,) directly in front of a Teaching Assistant. No comment was made by the TA, despite looking directly at the screen as the student worked. And with the reflection sheets, which were supposed to act as a feedback measure, that feedback was never visibly acted upon, and I seriously doubt that any of the feedback given within them (including some of the problems listed in these paragraphs!) ever reached the instructor. Across the board, there was not a great deal of respect on either side of the student-instructor division. For a Sophomore level course, seating in the classroom was fully by assignment, and attendance was mandatory at 15% of the final grade, with no allowances for missing days due to situations such as sickness or family emergencies. The instructor did not trust the students to organize themselves to learn efficiently, simultaneously removing the ability of the students to form into effective groups, which is a vital component of the scale-up methodology. Additionally, he had to resort to forcing attendance through grade manipulation in order to make students attend class, instead of making attendance actually worthwhile in learning the material. Whether or not the instructor actually disrespected the students isn't quite as important here as the perceived disrespect by the student body, which they reacted to. Students would attend lecture, and complete their homework for other courses, as they knew that trying to pay attention would not actually teach them. Recitations were far worse than lectures, and one of the most chilling moments was the complete silence as the TA stood by the board, with nearly every student in the recitation section working on other things, including but not limited to: Assignments for other classes; Crosswords; Video Games; Social Media; and Professional Accounts such as LinkedIn. This silence continued for nearly three minutes, in which the students were physically present, but not mentally present.  The students do not have a high opinion of the course. In an informal survey of about 20 students in the course of 110, not a single one had a positive reaction towards the course, and over half of them stated that it was the worst course that they were taking this semester. This was coming from students who were also taking courses such as Physics II, Calculus III, or Differential Equations. Over half of them admitted to doing other coursework during the class, and the vast majority of those surveyed stated that they did hadn't really learned anything. Now, this was only a sample of the class, and most of them shared a recitation course, but the overwhelming response received is concerning, to state mildly. As for my own personal thoughts, this course has been of little help to me. This course has taught me little more than what I could have learned from buying a textbook and studying independently for a semester. Doing that would actually still have been more beneficial, as afterwards I would still have a textbook available for reference, something that I will not have after this class due to the required purchase of an e-book from a limited-time third party site. I have learned more of the material for this class from its sister class, Metallography, than I actually have from the lecturing for this class. Will I pass this class? Quite likely so, and that is what concerns me. If I can pass this course not actually knowing the material I am supposed to learn, then other students in the class are going to advance with a similar or lower level of knowledge, knowledge we are supposed to know when we continue on to other classes such as Thermodynamics. Even if I do not fail this course, I feel that this course has failed to provide me with the knowledge I have paid time and money to learn, and that is what upsets me the most. This is not meant as an attack against the Instructor or the Teaching Assistants. I feel that outside of the classroom, you are likely all decent people. What I have attempted to convey with my words above is the state of the classroom as it appears from the student's perspective, in the hopes that what I have seen can help to fix the multitude of problems that still exist. I hope that it is of some use, and that changes will actually be made, as I would not wish this class in its current form upon anyone..| My TA was incompetent in recitation and never knew the answers to any questions we had.

1117,ME 6770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"Yes, he's an amazing professor, we are lucky to have Dr. Srinivasan as our Instructor and as our Adviser..| The scale up class room is not an effective learning style unless the students can sink numerous hours in to the material a day. This is not possible for most undergrad students because they work and typically take 4 other classes along side this class and a equal or greater in difficulty. If just reading the book was an effective means for the majority of students then there would not need to be a person to teach the course..| the format of the class with the annotations and leaving students to teach themselves was not effective. It required hours to read and reread the text and going to google before I started to understand. The time dedicated to this class took away from the other classes I was taking..| There are multiple things I did not enjoy about this class. I hated the flipped classroom aspect where we are just supposed to ask questions in class to get answers. Sometimes it's hard to bring up questions when you don't understand the material enough. Reading the book and doing annotations was also terrible. I understand the point to an extent. It did help me some of the time but honestly I think I could have learned significantly more if Dr. Srinivasan would have actually taught the class. There were a few times where he lectured and I learned more on those days than I did reading the book by far. I also hated Perusall because of the way it graded the annotations. It's also very hard to create 5 annotations for like 8 pages of material and 4 of the pages contain figures and images. It is hard to have them all evenly spread out and if you don't spread them out enough, you get docked points which I do not believe is fair. I believe this class is a very important class for materials students especially since it is very relevant when working with metals. I'm disappointed by not learning more and better understanding the material from this class and I was extremely interested in this class. Another thing I did not enjoy with this class was that the homework was unbelievably difficult. Many times it was hard to find the answers in the book if it had the answers and it did not really help my understanding of the material. I think this is because we never did any example problems and never got a chance to see how to solve these problems. One final thought is that I DID NOT like how the last exam (or quiz as he calls them) we took (not the final) was worth more than all our other exams/quizzes combined. Our first 4 quizzes were worth 10, 20, 20, and 20 points for a total of 70 points. Our last exam was worth 75 points and the entire format of the exam was changed and he did not give us any warning that the exam style would be different. This severely hurt my grade in the class because it was weighted so heavily and I was not properly prepared for the exam. This has been a very frustrating class from the beginning to the end.  Overall, I do not believe the flipped classroom style is the best way to teach this class, annotations need to be done better, homework needs to be better, and he needs to communicate a little better about exams/quizzes if things are going to change and if they are going to be so heavily weighted..| FORMAT OF CLASS COULD BE CHANGED A LITTLE, BUT IT WAS GOOD LEARNING AT THE SAME TIME.",2017 Fall

I had no idea when assignments were due or what assignments to do as their due dates seemed arbitrary..| Not good..| He is by far the most useless professor I have ever had. Unprepared is too good of a word for him. It seems as if this is the first time he has taught the course, yet when looking on wings express I found he has taught the course SEVERAL times. I cannot even begin to find the words to express his mediocrity..| Ineffective.| Not very effective.| awful I often left more confused after class and he is unorganized and this harm the students.| Dr. Lieh's capstone class was much more difficult than the classroom section of senior design should be. We spent the first half of the semester completing assignments and going over topics that did not relate at all to the senior design projects, and the second half rushing to finish our proposals. We never were given a specific set of requirements for our assignments. Instead, he would act nonchalant about the assignments and then grade them very harshly. Most of the time in the classroom seemed wasted, as it would have been more beneficial to just get that period to work on our own projects..| This is the most ineffective instructor I've had in my 121 credit hours of higher education. Why does he teach here?.| the instructor had some issues applying the guidelines for the class at first and didn't really post things on pilot on a regular basis.| Moderately effective, I feel the instructional pace could have been quicker, which would have left more time for working on projects and assignments..| reasonably effective.| He's not. No one ever knew what was due, when it was due, and what was going on. I still don't know what I was supposed to get out of that class.  He didn't have a reliable syllabus. The only reason we knew to turn something in was by word of mouth.  His grading... it's laughable. I'm 93% sure he just randomly chooses a number - much like I just did with the 93%. He didn't inform us of ANYTHING related to our senior design project. We didn't even know we were supposed to find a project by emailing professors until the second class.

1223,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 2,"Course seemed unnecessary. Lab work on the actual projects was more important than lecture time..| Kind of..| He constantly changed due dates, often completely forgetting what his syllabus said. Before the Thanksgiving break, he changed a due date to the following Monday after break. He made this change two days after our assignment was due, after the vast majority of the class had already submitted their assignments..| No clue because grades were not uploaded to pilot so i have no clue what my current grade is. We received graded papers back but he would change things or give extra credit so in the end you wouldn't know what your grade was..| There were no concrete expectations outlined in the syllabus.| no he would constantly make up assignments and change due dates and course work..| He would assign things, but he would give us no outline or rubric and then would grade them very harshly because we didn't do it the way he wanted even though we were never shown how it was supposed to be done. For our proposals, he would just say to first turn in a baby proposal and then at the end of the semester turn in an adult proposal. We did that to the best of our ability given the lack of instruction on what was expected, and our grade suffered mightily because of it..| Absolutely not. His expectations were very unclear. I only ever knew what was due because I heard about it from other students. He very rarely posted assignments on pilot, or wrote them on the board at least. But then when we turned in what we thought he wanted, we'd get low grades because it was missing things we didn't know we needed. I have a 4.0 GPA, so I know how to pay attention, follow instructions, and complete assignments if I have guidelines. How am I supposed to complete assignments that I don't know exist or I don't know the guidelines? I once emailed him back and forth 5 times asking for guidelines for a paper, and only after harassing him for an entire weekend did he post something. This is a class that should be dedicated to our final project, but it was impossible to keep Dr. Lieh pleased..| yes.| Not really. Assignments were graded on criteria that were either vaguely alluded to, or not even communication to the students. Grading was inconsistent. He did however give us opportunities to correct assignments. I understand that letting students fail then teaching them through correction is a method sometimes used, I find it to not be conducive to learning and a waste of time.

1226,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 5,"Did not clearly indicate expectations for class, nor assignment due dates..| Poorly..| Abysmal. He refused to use pilot, stating ""it never worked for him"". And when he did use pilot, he only used to news section to make posts. This meant that no notification went out to alert students to when he made an assignment. The only way to have knowledge of his posts is to have been looking at pilot at the right time. Then when class starts and we had no idea that he wanted us to do something, he would get angry and rant about how pilot is trash and how he never wants to use it. Any suggestions given to him on alternatives for how he could communicate differently were shot down in flames..| Awful, I never knew what was going on and honestly I don't think he did either..| Poorly.| awful, when I went to his office hours to ask a question he responded with ""come to class and youll find out"" even though I had not missed a class previous to this and met him during his office hours..| He would respond but wouldn't answer the question you had.| Terrible communication. Was hard to get an email response out of him, and didn't make assignment due dates or expectations clear in class. His accent is difficult to understand, but if he could at least write assignments on the board that would help, or utilize pilot. A lot of times he'd dismiss class, and then while everyone was packing up and leaving, he'd start talking about assignments or writing things on the board. At that point, no one can hear or they're leaving..| unknown.| not well, I understood probably 2/3 of what he said because of the language difference.| the instructor communicated somewhat effecitvely.| HA!.| NOT GOOD. BAD USE OF PILOT AND EMAIL, IN MY OPINION.",2017 Fall
1227,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 6,"No. Class seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. Lab time for each group would have been more effective..| Not at all..| As I am sure you can infer from previous statements made, organization is not Lieh's forte. Tangents, asides, and branching off are the only way that he knows how to communicate. It was far too often that he would be speaking and I would have to look at someone and ask ""how is this relevant to anything"" only to be met with ""I have no idea""..| No, completely random, in the end he just filled class time up with guest speakers that I did not find useful for class time. The speakers were good and I learned new things from them but I could have done that on my own time and he could have used class time to maybe teach us something that we could use for senior design..| No.| No..| No.| Absolutely not organized. The course is supposed to be dedicated to completing our senior design project, but the course content did nothing to help with the design, plan, construction, or anything to do with the project. And often times he'd end up on a tangent about unrelated things..| it could have been organized in a better way.| organized, but not helpful. While I did enjoy and learn from the guest speakers he invited, most of the core course material was a repeat of topics and tasks I had learned and been doing my entire time in college. A lot of the course time could have been better spent directly supporting the Capstone project or used as work time..| somewhat well organized.| I don't know how to answer this question. What course content?  Nothing was organized, this whole class is a mess and waste of time.  We could have been given time to actually work on our project, but no that would actually benefit us..| NO. VERY RUSHED.",2017 Fall
1228,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 7,Yes.| Kind of..| I never want to have to encounter Lieh outside of the times where I am in his class. So I cannot comment on how his office hours were. But that statement itself should be loud enough to show his ineptitude..| Yes.| Moderately available.| No..| Fair.| Nope. See any of the other answers above..| unknown.| yes.| yes.| KIND OF.,2017 Fall
1229,ME 4910,Junghsen Lieh,Question 8,"No.| I recommend immediate termination..| I think this class needs to be restructured, not worth paying for if this is what I get out of it..| Dr. Lieh should organize his course more and put more material and standards on Pilot.| he is the worst professor I have had the misfortune of having class with. He shows no interest in teaching or the students and repeatably singled students out and tried to embarrass them. Due to his actions he hindered our groups senior design project from the start and continues to do so. I believe keeping him as a teacher is harming WSU student's education here..| no.| Junghsen Lieh is not an effective instructor and caused much stress without getting anything useful out of it..| the teacher should post things more on pilot than just saying stuff in class..| Though the instructor was engaging in class lectures. Overall very nice person. Responded to questions when I needed to ask him. Just wish some of the assignments were more clearly defined as to how they will be graded instead of being more open ended..| What I learned in this class: Lieh had 7 years of straight A's..| STRUCTURE OF CLASS COULD BE MUCH BETTER. GUEST SPEAKER ARE NICE THOUGH.",2017 Fall
1230,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"Effective.| Most of class time is spent with him explaining things from the book with little to know worked through examples. It makes lectures hard to follow and little information can come from them..| A very intelligent instructor, but wasn't very effective on me. The class made me more frustrated than anything.  He had a very busy schedule outside of class made it very hard to schedule times to meet with him..| Dr. Slater is very smart. However, he could teach the class more if he would stop trying to impress the class by telling them how smart he is. Bragging on your self is a wast of everyone's time. Dr. Slater knows plenty enough to impress the class by doing examples in class so they better understand the material..| good",2017 Fall

1234,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 5,"Effectively.| Fine. If you send an email he responds. If you ask a question he answers it..| Email mainly, but getting a response often took a day or two which was frustrating..| Dr. Slater was fairly responsive to helping us even with his schedule. However sometime response seemed vague. Also too much class time was spend on him telling about all of his accomplishments. PLEASE DO MORE EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. 30 MIN PROOFS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS A WAST OF TIME..| good",2017 Fall
1235,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 6,"Yes.| Not particularly. It feels like he explains things with the assumption that you already know the material and that you are looking to learn more, which is not the case..| Could of been organized a little better. Manuscript used for the course was often incomplete. The manuscript he gave us did not follow the course content given in the lecture outlines. Equation numbers were different as were page numbers and chapters. Lectures just consisted of him reading notes and equations off his manuscript. Wasn't very helpful. Never went over any examples in class or anything like that. The lab portion of the class was very unorganized. We were never properly shown how to use the lab equipment. A lot of times the equipment didn't work.  We had to learn on the fly how to work it. The lab instructions were very plain (a sentence or two long)..| Yes. However, PLEASE DO NOT USE SLIDES FOR ENGINEERING CLASSES, that is what they do in are history class.| well good",2017 Fall
1236,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 7,"Yes.| Yes. He misses a lot of office hours but if you want an appointment he is available..| He was late to appointments in his office hour. Scheduled office hour at a very difficult time for the class to meet. Wasn't very flexible with this. I asked for a tutor or someone i could consult with during the week to get help with the material and he said ""there is no one else who can teach you this material other than me and a guy that doesn't work here."" We took our first exam in September and didn't get it back till over a month later in November. Actually i never received a grade back until about the 10th week of class which is ridiculous. Turned in homework but got no feedback on anything..| Yes.| well ok",2017 Fall
1237,ME 7690,Joseph Slater,Question 8,"No.| I believe this course is a very difficult class to take let alone teach. Being my first 7000 level class i took as a graduate student i don't believe i really had the prerequisites to take it. I think there should be a class or two before with material to prepare you for the material in this class. Overall a very difficult class. Much different than undergrad vibrations. Class was taught much different. Undergrad class didn't prepare me much for it.  I believe this class wasn't well organized, the instructor clearly knows what he is talking about with the content, but teaches it to us as if we have been studying it as long as him..| Overall I honestly think Dr. Slater is a good guy. The criticism should be taken as things that should be addressed. But, not that he is a horrible person. I think he would be a great teacher if he made the changes listed above..| please provide some video lectures..",2017 Fall
1238,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 1,"I couldn't follow anything this guy was talking about all semester. I kept trying and I kept rewatching the course videos, but could never follow for any significant length of time. Maybe I'm just an idiot..| 3 out of 10 Teaches using Powerpoint and that sucks.| He clearly knew what he was talking about but did a very poor job conveying the material..| Lectures are not too graduate driven. At times effective but at other times really confusing..| Dr. Huang is one of the best professors at explaining concepts that I have had.| His teaching style improved greatly when he begun working out problems on the board. His slides were sometimes difficult to comprehend..| no comment.| Dr. Huang is very passionate about what he teaches. He conveys concepts well verbally, but does NOT give students clear understanding of what is expected of them. He rushed through material very quickly toward the beginning of the semester. By the schedule set in his syllabus, we were well over halfway through the class before the halfway point of the semester. Dr. Huang's lectures are largely disorganized, consisting of frantic circling of notes on a projector. People began to cease attending lecture because, based on how the class was run, there were no notes to record. By the end of most classes, students left unsure of what they were supposed to know that day..| Sometimes difficult to follow, but that might have more to do with the time of the day the class was..| This class was taught at a level that seemed beyond the scope of what an undergraduate class should be taught at. Granted many of the students in the course were graduate students, many of the concepts were things that have never been taught before. It was hard to follow along with what was going on because the level of complexity of this class. Many students had trouble understanding the concepts and how to do the projects..| Very effective and informative lecture sessions..| Powerpoint slides were helpful, and lectures gave a good understanding of concepts..| He covered a most of the required material but didn't teach us any code but required that we submit our projects in a coding language no one knew, it was not optional what language we could uses.| He is very knowledgeable and has a lot of personal experience with the topics discussed. Sometimes, that can make him think the topic is easier than it is. A book might make some of the topics easier to understand or reference later..| not bad.| good.| overall effectiveness of the instructor is good because he describes the topic very well but examples are not solved in class after the completion of topic..| A very effective teacher, in my opinion..| good.| He is best.| Dr. Huang is very effective",2017 Fall
1239,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 2,"Yes.| Super hard grading and assignments. Unfair is a good word to describe it..| Maybe?  We never got any graded reports back so your guess is as good as mine..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes, but I think including an example report could help demonstrate what the projects are supposed to look like. Also, I'm aware feedback could be retrieved on request, but this would have been helpful if it were more accessible..| no comment.| The course syllabus is red herring in regards to the class expectations.  There is no written homework for this class. There is no book. The number of written examples done in class could be counted on one hand. The syllabus suggests that use of the software Mathematica and Matlab would be used for numerical analysis. This is absolutely false. The only software this course uses for it's numerical analysis is Fortran, and the software for plotting data is Tecplot. The professor has students use a computing language they have never seen to run high level, complex numerical analysis. The professor supplies code which students must modify to produce some output specified in his ""projects"". Projects make up 50% of the grade. Consequently, students do not learn about Computational Methods in this course because the class does NOT evaluate understanding of Computational Methods. The class does, however, test our ability to modify files in an obsolete computing language that the class, even by the end of the class, cannot understand. The remainder of the grade for this class is written exams. Students have no examples to try on their own because there is no book. And because there is no written homework, how are we supposed to do a written exam problem when the only thing we are graded on is our ability to modify code we can't understand? The class should have been based around Matlab--the software we are all familiar with as undergrads since we've had a course in it..| Yes.| I believe the instructor graded fairly based on the expectations given..| Yes.| Yes..| Not on the first exam, He did not clearly explain to us the requirements.| Yes.| no.| yes.| I guess instructor didn't evaluate our work because his grader does this job and he is not that perfect in grading..| I am not sure... a TA grades everything..| yes.| Yes.| Yes",2017 Fall
1240,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 3,"Yes.| Yes, but not always the full period.| Usually ended a bit early, but always started on time.| Yes.| Yes,.| Normally, but technical difficulties got him more than once..| no comment.| He routinely started at 6:30, the class start time. He routinely ended class early when he realized he was way too far ahead of his syllabus schedule..| Yes.| The class often started on time, and the instructor would be in the class room the entirety of the class period..| Yes.| Yes..| Yes he typically started on time.| We were ahead of schedule and left early some days..| yes.| yes.| Yes, instructor did start the class on time but he finishes it early and didn't utilizes the full time because he covers the topic very fast without solving any examples in class..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Started class on time, sometimes ended a bit early (that's OK with me).",2017 Fall
1241,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 4,"He told me he couldn't help me when I went to his office to ask for help because I couldn't form a specific enough question..| He had a lot of office hours and always made sure everyone knew what was going on before continuing to the next thing. But the people that didn't understand never spoke up..| He showed an intense interest in the course material..| Got very emotional in the subject matter at times which made it seem more interesting at times..| He is clearly very passionate about the subject and would do his best to make sure we understood..| no comment.| He asked questions about our understanding of the lecture. No one could ask questions because the lessons were reinforced via Dr. Huang's complex Fortran code. The only pertinent questions that could be asked were about Fortran syntax. At one point, this class becomes less about Computational Methods and Numerical Analysis (already a difficult subject) and far more about Fortran..| He often repeated that he wanted us to understand this material because it will be helpful. He gave us lots of resources and materials that he believes will help us later in our career. I appreciate the time and effort he gave to prepare the materials he provided..| Projects were challenging and driven towards real life applications. He tried to fit as much content as possible into the course so that we would have a lot of tools and experience upon completion..| Available in office hours and via email regularly. Office hours were helpful in getting me to understand how to solve projects without being given the answer directly..| He told jokes to wake us up.| You can tell he is excited about the material and likes teaching it..| not much.| good.| Yes, if i consider teaching he teaches the subject very well and his lectures were very interesting. But, again he didn't taught us the Fortran and was difficult to solve his projects because they were all based on Fortran..| Dr. Huang knows fluids quite well. This knowledge is apparent as he is very enthusiastic about teaching us..| very good examples.| He add practical problems in assignment.| Very good about answering questions and taking time to explain any difficulties in class.",2017 Fall
1242,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 5,"Seemingly effective enough for other people in the class, but I had a lot of trouble learning anything from him..| Well enough. Could be better could be worse. He gave us a retake on one of our midterm problems because of a miscommunication on his part..| Not very effectively in the classroom..| Not well, He seems nice but the grad student seemed to be in charge of that.| Fairly well. Sometimes it could take a couple days to receive an email response though, other times it was very quick..| no comment.| Fine. He's a nice person, well-intentioned. He offers to make himself available as any professor with office hours does. Again, lessons are about Computational Methods, but the grade comes from implementing it in Fortran. Which students could not do..| Sometimes difficult to follow. Admitted when he was wrong though..| I never had to communicate with the instructor outside of class, but from others I heard he was available during his office hours. In class he would answer any questions people had..| Very effectively..| Effectively..| Sort of effectively.| Good.| good in the classroom.| 9/10.| Yes, he communicated very well..| Quite well..| good.| Better.| Dr. Huang communicated effectively",2017 Fall
1243,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 6,"The notes were also very hard for me to get anything out of. They were confusing and I never felt like they led me anywhere. Just a bunch of information that was difficult to link together. It's like I missed a pre-req or something..| Sure.| The content tended to be slides with unexplained equations with undefined variables, while the code given out as a base to do the projects with was entirely uncommented leading to an excessively long time working out what each part actually did.  In most cases I was unable to fully understand the code or why it worked.  I was able to change small parts of it but commenting what each part did would be really helpful, especially since we are expected to comment what our changes do..| Somewhat, he got extremely ahead of schedule which made the first midterm cover way too much material..| They were fairly well organized..| no comment.| No. They jumped around. He would change subject constantly during lecture. This was another reason why people could not produce logical notes..| Sometimes difficult to follow..| To an extent. He had prepared notes, and knew exactly what he was talking about. Sometimes it was unorganized, but rarely..| Very well.| A bit more explanation into fortran syntax would've been welcomed, but not absolutely necessary..| It was a little scattered.| Yes, but a book may have helped.| lecture videos werent.| yes.| Yes, the course content and lectures were well organised. 9 out of 10..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes.",2017 Fall

He was very difficult to get a hold of online. Again the grad student seemed to be in charge of all of that..| Yes. He even scheduled meetings on the weekends to help me understand things..| He held office hours. My understanding is people could not get the information they were looking for communicating via email (and they were only emailing him with questions about Fortran syntax).

1245,ME 4010,George Huang,Question 8,"Look man, I'm sorry I couldn't follow you as well other people in this class. But seriously, you could have tried to help me. I know didn't make it to class often, but it was honestly because it was so hard for me to follow your trains of thought that I found it more productive for me to use this class period to eat my dinner (my second chance to eat on tues/thur after 8AM and before 9:30PM) and then watch the lecture videos on MWF. I watched all the lecture videos until you stopped uploading them, but it was still hard for me to learn a damn thing. Seriously, it felt like I missed a pre-req..| Stop with the power point. It's awful. Write everything step by step. We are not all as smart as you are. Go slower..| Comment your code.  I don't care if you know what it does and what you're doing, I need to know what it does so I can complete the assignments.  Just because a project is simple doesn't mean its easy, that's why Prandtl is famous..| No.| Please make using FORTRAN optional. I get it that compiler based languages can be very helpful to know, but we aren't taught that prior to the class and it puts students at a disadvantage and makes the course unreasonablely difficult for something that is not a key objective for an understanding of computational methods..| no comment.| I understand that George Huang has Fortran code that he has published apparently, and this is why he uses it in class. However, as powerful and impressive as the code is, students can't read it, manipulate it, or understand it. 50% of our grade comes from doing exactly that. This class would be FAR more effective in teaching computational methods if it used Matlab. Perhaps Dr. Huang cannot use Matlab and so chooses not to teach with it. This class NEEDS to have someone look into what's going on. It needs to change. Many students feel threatened that they won't graduate because they can't interpret Fortran.  Students are not learning about the course subject. Why does WSU require a Matlab course (a numerical analysis program for mechanical engineers) when the Computational Methods and NUMERICAL ANALYSIS course used a completely different software? If the college is dead set on using this language, please require a course in using it. This class as it is run is, without a doubt, setting students up for failure..| Only two gripes: 1. TA should not be grading the exams 2. Record all lectures, even if using the whiteboard (the audio only would still be helpful to refresh memory)..| This course is complex. I feel it should be strictly a graduate class. If this class must be a required course to graduate, it should not be so complex. This class seems like it should be the part 2 of a course, where the first part would be an introduction to Fortran, and simplified examples..| If possible recording the audio on the last group of lectures would still be helpful even though the majority of material was covered on the white boards. Having the recorded lectures proved very useful for both projects and exam review,.| None.| Students in the future should be allowed to use matlab, which the students understand, or Fortran should actually be taught.| no.| Yes, just want to inform that he should give and solve the examples in class after completion of the topic..| no.| No.| No.",2017 Fall

Then she divided the whole syllabus into terms, so whole class felt like the subject was easy to learn. Then she started asking us questions from our basic courses and this made the class even more interesting.",2017 Fall

1269,ME 7760,Sharmila Mukhopadhyay,Question 8,"Great class!.| she is one of the calm and very understanding teacher i have met in my life. thanks.| She should pay more attention to helping students with clarifications during her office hours and not give the student an impression to feel scared of coming for her office hours because she will always refer the student back to the textbook, that way it looks as if the student didn't read it the first time before coming to her office for help..| She is an awesome instructor and I really learnt a lot from this class",2017 Fall

She introduces concepts that are not required, but she knows are very relevant to real world applications.  Her depth of knowledge in the subject is very impressive..| Professor Mirmasoudi was very effective in class..| Shw was a very good instructor at teaching the concepts for the class.  She kept the large class on task and organized.  All of the concepts we taught effectively..| very good.| SHE IS THE BEEEEEEST.| Good Class, learned a lot..| The class is very effective and a lot of content is introduced..| Okay.| Good..| The class material was clearly presented. Nothing was too repetitive, and things sped up as expected as the overall Solidworks skill level increased.

Fantastic teacher!!!!.| She was a very knowledgeable professor and you could tell she knew what she was talking about. She was typically very clear with instructions as we followed along, but sometimes she went too fast for people and we had to wait to let them catch up. The one part that she did not make as clear was the written portion of the class. We spent lots of time on the practical portion of the class, which is important and much more interesting, but not much time was spent on learning or reviewing the symbols and markings which are very important.",2017 Fall

There were a few deadlines that were different in class versus on pilot, and the sample report was never posted. This led to some less than ideal grades on early assignments. But later in the semester, communication was effective..| As previously stated, if there were any confusion or questions based on requirements or the material itself, she did an excellent job of clarifying these for the entire class. That included the timely reply of emails and then communicating the content of these emails without saying who emailed her, to ensure that no other students were having the same issues and if so to address these with them as well..| She was great at answering questions in class and also emails whenever someone had a question out of class..| Very effectively.

1277,ME 1040,Sara Mirmasoudi,Question 8,"no.| Overall a very good professor, she is a little difficult, but I fell like a learned more than the other class on solidworks applications. I would recommend her to beginner engineers looking to learn a lot and who are passionate about the field..| Maybe have dimension sheets or follow along sheets for students while teaching a lesson they can see things without having the teacher go back and re-explain and take extra time, or the student get lost and fall behind because they missed some dimesnions when they were fixing a problem or touched a wrong button.  Also some students do not have drafting and CAD experience and the class takes off pretty fast assuming everyone has the experience..| no.| No.| Mrs. Mirmasoudi warmed up to the class after a few weeks. Her teaching style is very immersive and benefits students in the industry,.| No..| I would have loved to cover more material with the implementation of a much faster pace, although I understand why this would be a difficult addition. I like more intense material, otherwise tend to focus on other classes, which is why the most difficult design tasks were my best grades. So an intense lecture covering a large amount of materiel would be perfect for students like me..| I felt that Mrs. Mirmasoudi not only taught me how to use SolidWorks, but also how to utilize it for resumes, interviews and future careers.

1301,ME 7550,James Menart,Question 8,"No.| Great course. I learned a lot about the field and Dr. Menart's love for the subject comes through.  This is the sort of treatment that I joined the RCL program to see. As far as areas for possible improvement go, it seemed that the course pacing was a bit uneven, with lots of extra time spent on a couple of chapters, as compared with the syllabus, and a couple of chapters left uncovered. One change to speed up the early material would be reducing the time spent coaching the use of Excel. There are many numerical tools out there and graduate students should be expected to bring a toolbox with them to a 7000-level class.  However, I expect that Dr. Menart is drawing on previous experience here and perhaps the coaching is necessary. One compromise might be some video instruction on Pilot that the students could access outside of class..| I shall definitely look forward for my future courses with Dr. Menart..| no.| Nope, he's the best!",2017 Fall

1328,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Very strong..| The professor had respect for students and was open for questions at all times.  He provided good examples and definitely challenged students in thinking about how to solve problems..| need more examples of problems in class with numbers.| It is a hard subject to teach, and I think he did a good job of trying.| Your subject is really difficult, so when students get an average of 60% on the exam, it is because you didnt ever do practice problems on the topics. we get bad grades on homework that is not relevant and is far more complex than test material. additionally, with no numbers on tests, only variables, its impossible to do well unless we have swallowed your format of doing things. thats not learning, that is learning how to pass your exams..| Doesn't teach from the textbook which is a waste. Uses completely different methods from the book, so you don't have any reference material besides the notes..| Explanations and example were gone through very quickly though the instructors always stopped for questions..| I think he does a really good job on being clear with explanations, handling questions, and having the students think..| The teaching style is great using notes and handouts which allow for a better understanding. I feel there needs to be more examples covered rather than the theory to help explain how to use the theory in a variety of ways. He answered all of the questions that were asked very well there was just not many questions asked mainly for the fact that I believed if you were confused in the class yu would not know how to ask a question to make it more clear..| This was a very challenging course. The lectures were well organized and the handouts were helpful for keeping example problems organized.  My main complaint about the course is the homework. I understand that assigning homework more difficult than the exam aids in helping you think more about the topic and the problem-solving processes. However, the sheer difficulty of these homework problems was a little ridiculous at times and I do not feel it prepared me for the exams simply because of the differences in difficulty. Yes, it was clarified at the beginning of the semester that studying the homework was not a good way to prepare for the exams, but that still makes the homework a little less helpful overall. I am glad that old midterm materials were provided for studying. That was extremely helpful..| Very clear, told exactly what you needed for the class.| Overall the class was difficult. I believe he could explained the material better than just the theory aspect of the course. He did not seem to care to help the students after exams scores were reviewed. He just stated ""we were the worse class he has had"" but has done nothing different to prepare for the final exam..| NEVER USED NUMBERS. I get it, you can better generalize the problem with variables, but were engineers.  We need numbers sometimes too.  Took so many notes!  My hand felt like it was going to fall off by the end of class..| Instructor presented content and examples clearly; questions were handled quickly, effective and it appeared with enthusiasm; applications of the content were elaborated as to arose interest and identify objective, this was effective in stimulating thought; instructor was respectful..| The few examples that were portrayed were unclear to me and there was too much time spent on deriving equations when practical problems could have been done.| He seemed to do pretty well on all these bases. Examples were always relevant and pretty helpful..| Examples were very specific and often times hard to apply outside of class. Material taught in class should be less derivation and more application..| Philippe Sucosky handled questions very well and provided us with good notes that were well outlined. He was always focused on presenting the material so he was neither respective, nor irrespective of students (which is how it should be as his job is to teach us).| He was very good at giving examples and explaining the concepts of everything..| The homework was pointless to do because it was impossible to relate to the exams, the only reason to do it was because of the weight it has on your final grade. The exams were brutal and the first exam very little study material and background knowledge on what was expected was poorly laid out. The second exam he provided 5+ exam solutions so we could study them, but had no solutions to them so knowing whether or not your answer was right was impossible to tell.  He did answer questions well, but often exam scores were followed with ridicule because the class had failed to demonstrate the knowledge of a subject that he has so seriously made more difficult..| He taught pretty well, but sometimes it was very hard to process what was going on because we went through the material so fast.  He did not seem very respectful to his students. He is very arrogant and rude, and he treated us like we were all stupid..| I thought Dr. Sucosky was very effective in his teaching. He took the time to walk, step-by-step, through example problems to make sure the students understood what was being asked, and what values/variables meant to obtain a better understanding of the material..| I know that this guy knows what he is talking about, but he seriously does not stop talking from the moment class starts, until it ends. I was not aware that someone can multitask to the point where they can be saying one thing and writing down another. Very hard to keep up with him in his lectures and nobody knows what is going on so nobody can really ask a question.| Very clear, concise, and well versed when teaching this subject. Master of Fluid Dynamics..| Did a great job explaining the concepts of problems and general equations. Answered all questions asked with full explanation every time.| Very good.| Good clarity.  Would be better if more examples were used for each type of problem..| When answering direct questions often the instructor would give vague, and unhelpful answers..| Mr. Sucosky was very clear on presenting topics, though the accent was different for the first 3 weeks. The handouts he provided were very clear and helped immensely. He was constantly challenging us to do better. He treated everyone with respect, even if they did not treat him with it..| He provides everything you need for his exams and homework. The handouts are directly correlated with homework and he provides enough exam examples to get a grasp on how to solve the problems. Homework is more difficult and lengthy than most courses assignments but if you can do the homework, you can take his exams..| Dr. Sucosky appeared to be doing his best to teach a very difficult subject..| He was very clear. If there was any kind of confusion you could always ask him questions and he would clarify as much as he could..| He goes over the lecture notes a little too fast",2017 Fall
1329,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 12,"Dr. Sucosky answers questions well but does so condescendingly. He doesn't seem approachable although once you get passed the intimidation, he is very helpful..| The instructor was very helpful in helping me understand the material. The professor would be very helpful during office hours and would encourage people to ask questions..| somewhat, lecture went so fast couldnt do anything but just copy the notes.| yes.| No, he doesn't demonstrate enough examples to practice for the exams..| Gave many real world examples. Would provide handouts for hard to understand concepts..| Yeah he would in office hours when he would write on the board and give explanations..| Yes, he used multiple real world examples which gets you more interested and involved in the class such as showing examples of how a wind tunnel is used and also different real world programs.| Yes. Lectures were well organized. I liked the handout system for example problems. It is easy to keep the examples separated from the theory notes..| Yes.| No, I have had to rely on the textbook to help me understand the material and groups of friends working together to pass the course..| no. When midterms were taken he proceeded to tell us that we are the worst class that he has ever had and that we gave no effort, and that is why the class average was a 60!  NO BUDDY, THATS ON YOU.  Says he will not curve the grades. BUT HALF OF THE CLASS HAS A GRADE OF A ""D"" OR BELOW.  Sucosky look in the mirror, the problem is a little bit more than you just having dumb kids..| Yes..| I thing he tried to make the class easier but through my mind his way of teaching just made things harder.| Gave relevant examples and was available during office hours..| Teacher was always available for email and office hours..| Yes and no. The big problem I have with this class was the difficulty of the homework. I understand and appreciate the need for difficult homework, however I don't believe homework should be exclusively difficult. Rather, we should work up to more difficult problems. By doing only hard problems, the foundation for solving problems is not established. If homework is where the real learning is supposed to happen then more emphasis should be put on the learning process. On the other hand, I believe the tests were very fair and well made..| He made the textbook redundant. The lectures were essentially a more understandable and digestible version of the textbook, making his lectures invaluable..| he was available via email and office hours.| Yes. Everything I learned in this class came from his handouts and our in-class notes..| Yes, Dr. Sucosky was available during his office hours to answer specific questions or explain concepts not well understood during lecture. He was very patient and would aid in my understanding of the material during his office hours..| Negative ghost rider. I was treated like an idiot who was not worth his time and then he would answer my question out of pure annoyance and pity..| Yes, he was very clear and concise with his teaching. He was able to answer any questions on the subject as he knew the material inside and out..| Yes. He always answered questions well and went into extra detail where students normally make mistakes..| Yes, by giving full depth explanations into the concepts of the general equations and answering all questions when students were confused.| Yes, always provided good examples.| Yes, but understanding material for the homework and exams were very difficult..| I did not find the format of the class very helpful. Most of the questions we used were all symbolic with very few numbers or simplification. For example the Navier Stokes examples never used any numbers. Instead the integrations and equations ended up extremely complicated..| He did aid in my understanding. He would answer any questions I had. I met with him multiple times during his office hours..| Yes..| Yes he helped as much as he could. He was very helpful in office hours and in class. I went to him in his office hours almost every week sometimes twice a week and he was always helpful. He wouldn't just outright give you the answer he would make sure you understood where your mistake was and how to fix it. Homework was challenging, but all of the homework he gave was real-life applications. The real-life application kept me interested and helped me to have an idea of why i was learning fluid dynamics.",2017 Fall
1330,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 13,"Professor Sucosky did a great job of explaining material and challenging students. His expectations were straight forward and he was willing to help in any way possible. A tough professor, but one that is willing to help in and out of the classroom..| nothing.| I gave a 'D' for my response regarding the materials contributing to my learning for this reason: on the exams we were directly told not to study the hw, or the book, because they were overly complex. But studying only the notes was not quite effective because they were overly simplified. This setup made things difficult and stressful, but feel like I learned fluids..| I liked him, but at times he can be a little intimidating in his office hours..| Regarding the homework comments above: What I would have found extremely helpful was one problem on each homework assignment that is similar to the style we would see on an exam. I gladly would have done an additional problem on each assignment if I knew it was going to help me prepare for what I might see on an exam.  I appreciate the old midterm material being provided for us, but the only problem with that is that you do not have the solutions, so you don't really have a way of checking your solutions aside from asking the instructor, which can be inconvenient if 60 students are asking to check work on 5 old midterms with 3 problems each. By putting an exam-style problem on the homework, we could check our solutions to at least one of these problems since the homework solutions are posted weekly anyway..| hard class, no numbers in class or in exams. Does not explain anything in detail.  Homework is crazy hard..| none.| none.| While the examples and discussions of the concepts were all excellent, the only complaint I have is the complete lack of any numerical problem. While this is likely due to the incredibly theoretical nature of the course, it could have been helpful to see a few numerical problems..| At the beginning of the semester, he showed us a couple of previous course evaluations that stated that this class was hard and the homework was unnecessarily difficult. He told us that he did not like seeing these statements on the course evaluations, because he gives difficult homework on purpose.  Despite the fact that he does this on purpose and doesn't like seeing this, I'm going to say it anyway. The homework in this class unnecessarily hard, and it takes way too long. I honestly believe that these homework assignments did more harm than they did good; they left everyone confused, and most everyone in the class used websites like Chegg to solve the problems..| He needs to do a far better job at explaining how to do problems instead of doing nothing but theory for an hour and a half..| No comment.| I really enjoyed the class. With a clear lecture and guided handouts, the class was easy to follow and engaging.| The class was very well organized. I never thought i had wasted time in his class. The material is very challenging, but he gives enough examples to help you understand the subject. He was always willing to help you during office hours, class or outside of class through email. He was very frustrated when students were not understanding the material and not letting him know. During this class i felt as though i was responsible for my grade. Every grade that i received good or bad i earned. He gave plenty of examples and extra problems and was very clear about what was expected of you on the exams. He did not use pilot and quite frankly i thought the format was better. He would send out emails about your grade every week; as a result i was never unclear about what my grade was. Overall, I would definitely take him again for another class.",2017 Fall
1331,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 14,"For the help of future students, providing the solutions of past exams would help students learn more. Furthermore, the consideration of time and understanding of how tough some homework sets were, would be helpful. At some points, hours would be spent on a homework set, which would cause more stress than understanding of the material.  Overall, great and helpful professor. He was willing to help and definitely challenges students through those homework problems. He is definitely willing to help students learn..| none.| Very professional, which is appreciated.| stop using old final exam problems as homeworks, this is why students either cheat on HW or do poorly.| If he went over more examples and provided more solutions to practice exams, the class would be easier to study for considering he doesn't use the textbook. He would be a much better professor if we had more to study and learn from..| While I wouldn't go back to an open note open book exam, I do think a crib sheet is helpful to both exam performance and student learning as it forces the student to comprehend the material and lay it out in a limited space..| Very well taught class but I would have preferred a greater variety of examples for each subject to understand the problems better..| If I had a choice between him and another professor I would not take him again and several of my peers would agree to that statement.  His main focus is research and the theory behind everything. Not problems we would use at a manufacturing company..| The instructor addressed his french accent as being comical. He was correct. Also, he enunciated sufficiently to be easily understood..| I thought Dr. Sucosky was an effective professor and I would not mind taking him again for another class..| Sucosky is an exemplary teacher and knows what he is doing. If there is room for improvement, its making the homework more directly related to what is learned in class, or to focus on the principles and equations of the course instead of their derivations..| Looking forward to taking him for Heat Transfer now that I know how his class functions.| This was one of the first semesters that Dr. Sucosky didn't let his students use notes on the tests. He said that this would help us to get better grades. Then, when we got our first exam back, he told us that we were one of the worst performing classes he had ever seen. Then, when we got our second exam back, his exact words were, ""This is the worst I have seen since I've been teaching Fluid Mechanics."" I think it should be very obvious to him that the reason for our poor performance is that we were not given the same privileges as his previous classes. Hopefully in the future, he will either let his students use their notes again, or at least make their exams easier if they are not allowed to use their notes..| I learned a lot from this class and understand the material very well. The homework was challenging but also allowed for deeper understanding of the material..| His homeworks might as well have been a weekly exam that you were getting no help with..| None.| I think we should have homework from the book. It would have helped to have some mandatory homework that was easy so I could get some confidence in the subject. I think there should have been more examples in class and some examples with numbers(I understand that this would be hard with this subject) Needed to engage the class more ( Ask us questions more frequently, Show us more videos or images that stimulate our interest and get us to ask questions). He did very well at explaining the material clearly and consistently. I did like writing the notes out in class but sometimes moved too fast and I couldn't follow along (just mindlessly writing down notes).| Thank you for a great semester..| Very blunt so there is no confusion as to what you need to be able to do to pass his course. Lectures are very well structured and there is no confusion as to what needs to be done. Class time is always used to its fullest with providing the student information. Not much time for questions but material is provided in a very orderly fashion that doesn't really raise any questions until trying to complete homework, which you can go to his office hours for any clarification..| His accent is pretty sweet..| I just don't think that he respects the undergraduate students at all and looks down on us. In his office hours there is hostility, and he gets pissed if you don't understand something: ""this really isn't hard material"". He also doesn't dedicate his office hours to the students that come in, and works on his research while you ask him for help. He gives you a response, and then doesn't care if you are still stuck. He just wants to get you out of there as soon as possible, no patience. Almost every response to a question is answered condescendingly. I have had an A in his class up to this point in the semester, so it's not like I'm a bad student either for him to be treating me this way. A lot of students aren't doing good in the class, and I feel like him being so hostile has prevented people that need help from asking him. If i have a 95 average for the first two exams, and he treats me like an idiot, then I can only image how he treats the students that are failing who understand the material much less than I do.",2017 Fall

1342,ME 3360,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"Dr. Sucosky has a very unique style of teaching, compared to the other engineering professors. He was willing to give out handouts that simplified complex problems..| Dr Sucosky taught this class as if all of his students were experts in Heat Transfer. If a student went to his office hours for consultation, he would say that if you didn't understand you would fail the class. He is a smart person and a good professor, he just seemed to not always assist students who didn't grasp concepts immediately..| Very very very good. Great professor.| He's very good at stopping to explain if people have questions..| Very clear explanations. Kind of disrespectful. The class average on the first exam was about a 55%, and rather than acknowledge that maybe he didn't sufficiently prepare us, he basically said it was sad we didn't know how to do better. I didn't think that was appropriate. He wasn't helpful in answering questions and usually didn't give enough nudge in the right direction to even know where to begin..| the teacher was very organized he had everything set up for the students to learn the material conceptually and do problems to learn it mathemeatically.| Good notes.| Extraordinarily organized.  His notes were outstanding and well organized.  He provided examples in class that defined the process by which we could use to solve the homework problems which were always challenging and stimulating.  He always shows respect for all the students and is readily available to answer questions.  Dr. Sucosky is an excellent instructor and knows the material that his is teaching.  His notes are outstanding and something that I will always keep for reference..| Dr. Sucosky is an organized professor, providing many notes, examples, and other materials for learning..| Overall the instructor did a fairly good job with the class since it was his first time teaching the course. There were a couple of mistakes in the handouts and lectures which caused some confusion on one of the tests but otherwise he did a very good job..| Very effective in teaching, material in class was always clear, the exams followed the examples given in class, very fair grader.",2017 Fall

He was available during office hours and at other unscheduled times.  I ask many questions in class to make sure that I understand the material, and he always responds in a positive fashion..| Yes.

I have 150 undergraduate hours (BSAAE), 30 graduate hours in engineering (MSAE) and 60 graduate hours in business (MBA).  Dr. Sucosky ranks as one of the best four instructors that I have had the privilege of sitting in his lectures.  His teaching skills and subject knowledge are outstanding..| Overall fairly good job. One suggestion I have is to upload all the notes at the begging of the semester so students can print of the handouts ahead of time instead of having to print them off before class every time. In addition, I wish homework assignment could be done in pencil or ink instead of just ink because if you make a mistake I usually had to completely rewrite the mistake or else the assignment looked messy and unprofessional. Again these are just suggestions on how to make the course better because I believe in continuous improvement. Again I want to reiterate the instructor overall did a pretty good job..| Great professor, encourages students to work hard and learn..| Changes could be made to the homeworks.

I do feel like he could have done a little more to engage the class and stimulate conceptual thinking among the students instead of focusing more on derivations..| he was passionate about the course and was able to explain the topics in an understandable manner.| Difficulty of the material of this course ranged dramatically. A lot of the class was derivation of equations which was redundant and unnecessary at time. Usually, 30 minutes of class time could be boiled down to an equation in the book that was boxed in and could easily be referenced.  What would be far more helpful is explaining the physical significance of an equation. This was done sometimes, but I feel like a lot of class time was not well spent.

Goes into great detail on the important components of the course and doesn't spend much time going over things already taught in the past. Overall, great instructor..| Class notes were relevant, examples were helpful. Book problems were more skewed toward being theoretical and less like what appeared on exams..| Very clear with lectures.| Class notes were posted online which was great.| He is very knowledgeable on the subject. There were several occasions through the semester when he would make corrections to the text book because they had derived an equation wrong. Maybe a new book would help. There were a lot of corrections..| Instructor was cleared with his subjects. He used different practical examples for better understanding of subject. He repeated ask students if they had question and was catering to each question in a polite manner..| Everything was great..| CLARITY OF EXPLANATION :  1. Professor used well organised class notes to explain us .  2. He had uploaded all notes on pilot well in advance .so when I started with this course, I had all required material wit me well in advance..  3. He writes each and every steps on the white board to explain which indeed helped me know the procedure well.  4. He gives more time to students to grasp and understand. At the end of the class ,he takes QUIZ. This method is best in two ways. In the first, it keeps us alert always . Secondly it helps us improve our grades. 5. He solves many examples in the class to make us understand.  HANDLING OF QUESTIONS: 1. He tries his best to handle all our doubts i the classroom. If he cannot, he goes back and then the next day he does it without fail.  2. I approached him many times during his work hours for doubts, He cleared all my doubts . 3. He responds immediately to our mails and solves our problems. SIMULATION OF THINKING: 1. He gives quiz problems at the end of the class which keeps us alert and keep thinking on the problems and concepts. This helps to develop thinking process 2. He gives Take home Projects. This helps us to learn the concepts, learn new software (I learnt MATLAB while doing the project) as well as we get acquainted to the paper presentation technique and writing a technical paper RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL: 1. He respects all individuals and treats all students equally.| Dr. Yang is a very thorough professor when it comes to learning. He kept in class quizes to monitor the performances of students and it proved to be very helpful. The projects which he gave were challenging and it helped to get a better knowledge about the course..| yes, professor Zifang yang's lecture were well organised, his clarity of explanations and examples are awesome, even he has good thinking ability and respect for individuals and their differences..| Professor has an exceptionally good teaching style that helped me to learn each topics easily...| I think there are a lot of issues with this course and how it's presented. Starting with the materials we are required to purchase, the book is not only ten years old but is completely wrong on most equations. Before we begin a chapter, the instructor has to go through the text with us and correct each mistake. This is made worse by the fact that these corrections are not posted on the website, meaning that if you happened to miss that particular day, or make an improper correction, you are at a disadvantage. The notes that Dr. Yang posts to the website, in my opinion, offer nothing to the course as they are literally just the text from the book copied word-for-word. There might be a few expanded steps on derivations listed, but this not very helpful. The variables used in each chapter may, or may not, mean different things and they are hardly ever introduced clearly. There are a lot of issues with the book and notes, and they need to be addressed. The biggest issue, however, is the way the material is presented. Essentially, it's just copied from the book/notes with no real application presented. The equations are derived, and he tries his best to explain the process used, but when it actually comes to using the equations listed to solve for a physical quantity, there is no help. This makes the homework very difficult as most of the time students are unsure of what is actually being solved for. When it is solved, we are unsure of what the quantity represents. I was challenged by the difficulty in the homework, but only so in finding ways to solve it. Not actually in critical analysis and thought, which is what the engineer is supposed to do..| He is overall good.| Bonus quizzes were helpful in maintaining concentration.",2017 Fall

The homework, which is supposed to help the students understand the applications of the text, only further confused us as we could not really apply what was learned in class, and instead had to look elsewhere for answers. The Joukowski airfoil project that we were required to do was also confusing in what it was trying to teach; was this a project to test the students' ability to code correctly (may be beneficial to post a MATLAB code with key equations left out so that the student may concentrate on concepts learned in class), understand concepts in the text that were not thoroughly explained, see how the joukowski transformation works, or to see who understood aerodynamic principles? The midterm exam was also unfair; Dr. Yang introduced a problem that has never been assigned in homework, barely discussed in class, and made it worth 40% of the overall grade. When asked about this, he said in class that this was how he identified the ""good"" students from the ""bad"" students. I, personally, can understand giving a trick problem on an exam to see how the students will react to it, but I would not make it the most important problem..| Somewhat agree.| yes.",2017 Fall
1372,ME 7300,Zifeng Yang,Question 13,Not necessary..| No additional comments.| No.| He spent three class periods talking about CFD/his research which caused the discussion of turbulent flows to be cut short. This is frustrating because we have multiple other classes that discuss CFD but no other classes that cover turbulent flows in depth..| No further comments.| Overall instructor taught this subject really well..| 1.Very considerate and student friendly towards students.  2. He sees and considers the hard work of students and helps them to improve the grades by giving bonus quiz's and additional bonus question in main exam 3. He is at the same time very strict and does not tolerate cheating or plagiarism which is very good. Because if a professor let goes plagiarism then this will be injustice towards hard working students 4. He treats all students equally.| His teaching is good he got good notes for this subject and best knowledge. 9 out of 10..| He is a good and knowledgeable professor who is having an expert teaching skill sets....| He is good instructuer,2017 Fall

I truly believe, however, that he may want to reconsider how this course is taught and what the educational goals are. If I had one recommendation moving forward, it would be to change the textbook used in class..| Have you considered writing your own advanced fluids book, or trying to find an open-source textbook?

He didn't do a great job explaining some things.| Examples were very helpful and he always wanted us working together and helping each other think through problems..| I liked how he worked out tons of example problems step by step.| Mr. Priezjev has a very simple and effective form of lecturing. His slides take all the material in the book and show what is most important and needed. He gives and works lots of examples that help with the homework and in understanding the material..| I feel like his examples were confusing because he would randomly change variables. It was just really hard to follow some of his examples..| very clear and good.| He wasn’t super clear when doing examples in class. I felt the class lectures weren’t very relevant to the test material. He didn’t really make me want to learn considering he would have verbal quizzes that we couldn’t use calculators on and he never explained the answers well at all. Class lectures were typically very boring PowerPoint slides when I find its most effective to do example problems instead..| Would answer any questions..| He tries to explain at his best, since i was lost in one of the lectures, it was very difficult to c=get along all through the entire semester. his homework are too difficult..| Nikolai is a great professor. He gives plenty of example problems to explain how dynamics work. I'm sure I would have learned a lot if I paid attention..| Examples were good. Some of the material was just like looking at a different language some times. Derivations were done so quick that even asking for where certain pieces came from I was left confused after an explanation.

He will stop and give more explanation if it seems the class doesn't understand something..| I think I have a better understanding of how a lot of things work.

Overall an awesome professor in my opinion..| I found that I was more confused in class that anything. He would go back and forth saying how easy something is and then how difficult it is, so its like he doesn't even know how difficult it is. He tried to teach math off of PowerPoint, but his implementation wasn't good. I just didn't come out learning as much as I was hoping. I felt like I learned more about this subject from physics..| very good teacher.| I liked being able to use a crib sheet on exams because in the real world I would have resources available to me anyway and a lot of professors don’t get that. I REALLY didn’t agree with him keeping exams in a folder and having the class pass it around to dig theirs out. That is a complete invasion of academic privacy because everyone would know how every single person in the class did on the exam.

Answered questions clearly and effectively..| His notes were the best I have ever seen from any professor! Very neat handwriting, super easy to follow. He made even the hard problems look easy by explaining every step and involving the class in discussions of how best to solve the problem..| He kept the whole class stimulated by keeping a brisk pace. And writing down alot of stuff.| Very well laid out lectures that were heavy on example. Class time was never wasted. Occasionally did not seem to understand a specific question about an example, but eventually got to the answer. Very good at describing a process of thinking that would apply to many different problems.| Dr. Li is a great teacher who is able to explain Statics very well through key points and specific examples. He is also very kind and showed equality to all students present within the classroom..| Effective lectures and exams.| Handled questions well.  Made class extremely boring not motivating students at all.  Would skip through several steps of problems which is ok sometimes.

We had all the knowledge to work from on the bulk of this project halfway through the semester, and yet you chose to wait until the week before our second exam to assign it. so right before break when communication would be hard and before an exam so that the project was not what we were focused on passing. You did this same stunt last semester in Mech. of Materials. For the sake of your future students, please dont do this again.

1454,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 11,"No significant issues are present..| Dr. Gockel is an extremely kind and cool instructor. She is very easy to understand, and doesnt pull things from ""out of the air."" She does things by the book very well, in which i am referencing the textbook. She answered every question as best as she could, and obviously knows her subject well..| She walked us through many examples to make sure we knew how to do the problems, she answered any questions we had, and gave us pop quizzes to keep us on our toes..| She is good at explaining the problems whenever someone is stuck..| Dr. Gockel is a very nice person, but she really needs to work on not making so many errors in what she writes on the board during lecture.  I understand occasional lapses and arithmetic errors, etc...  But errors in the equations that she wrote on the board were so common that I stopped trusting that what she was writing was correct.  It was lucky that there were other students in the class who were on the ball enough to catch her mistakes, otherwise I would have trusted her and not understood the material.  Also, I learned most of this class from the book.  I basically lost interest in the class after the first exam because the material on the exam was nothing like what we learned in class.  In other words, if it weren't an open book exam and it were say, an open note exam, most people would have probably failed miserably.  That being said, I do realize there is a large amount of information in this class..| Great.| Dr. Gockel gave plenty of examples during class that helped show concepts from the book..| Clear explanations, relevant examples, good at answering questions, and very respectful. I think of her as a role model..| the teacher was very knowledgeable about the material made sure the student came into the the course understanding the importance of the material like how to look up values from tables to solve problems..| Need to slow when copying your notes to the board.  Explain the step in a little more detail..| Joy has the potential to be one of the best engineering professors in this place.  The Good: - Goes over material straight out of the textbook so it's well organized and easy to look over. - Gives extra credit for those who are struggling - Genuinely wants students to learn The Bad: - She does not understand that there is way too much material in each exam Recommendation: - I HIGHLY recommend you have more than 3 exams a semester. After every chapter, give a smaller version of an exam. This way you can cover everything and test us over it all, but it would still be fair. I promise you will see a huge difference in your exam averages. - Maybe consider allowing students to retake 1 (or 2 if you have more than 3 exams) exams a semester - because sometimes you have bad days. - Give us ALL old exams and worked out problems to look over at the beginning of the semester - I personally like to study material ahead of time for class and exams.| Loved your examples in class and how you took the time to step through each part of a problem, I wish more instructors did this..| Was very thorough in examples and offered assistance to the class whenever it was needed..| Dr. Gockel is a wonderful professor who really wants the students to dig into the details and fully understand the concepts.| She laid out good examples during class and was available for contact through email. The final project was a topic of choice which allowed us to learn more about our topic of choice..| Examples were well chosen. Writing where the equations, tables, etc were found helped greatly, please continue in future..| Well laid out class with the material covered, good use of examples in class mixed in with the theory, questions were always answered clearly, posed questions to help motivate us to think deeper on the subject. Never had any problems with the class",2017 Fall
1455,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 12,"Yes..| Yes, she did. She performed numerous examples in class that were very helpful in the calculation parts of the class. I (and maybe some of the class) went into the first exam not knowing what was going to be on it exactly, resulting in a bad grade for me on it. I think she realized this, and on the second exam, she carefully outlined the kinds of problems and what to expect, and i did exponentially better on it because of it. I was very happy she did this, and also dropping an exam grade takes a load of stress and anxiety off me..| Whenever I had questions about the homework, I went to her office hours, where she answered my questions and explained how to do the problems..| Yes..| Somewhat, but I mostly learned from the book.  She went over a lot of stuff that I didn't find useful for the exams and I also found that my understanding of the material she went over was pretty watered down.  This is not usual for me in classes..| Yes, great in class example.| Yes. I met with her on a couple occasions to discuss projects or assignments. She was also more than willing to answer questions..| yes, she taught us from lecture notes to aid in our learning and gave us a project to apply our learning to it..| Yes her step by step instruction for each problem throughout the semester was great. She also had a guest speaker come in and talk about additive manufacturing..| Instructor was very helpful, such as timely responses to emails and help on homework assignments..| very much. Provided good examples in class and challenging homework that really allowed the students to grasp the concepts.| She answered questions that were off topic.| Yes, examples in class, see above comment..| Yes, examples worked in class really helped with understanding of the material for the homeworks and exams",2017 Fall
1456,ME 4150,Joy Gockel,Question 13,"--.| The exams were way too long.  Too much material was packed in and most of it was serially ordered so that if you couldn't get an answer to something, you would have trouble moving on.  This made it incredibly difficult when you were stuck on some small detail.  I have seen a lot of exams where the teacher will give you a value to use in the next portion, so that they don't have to carry through errors, i.e. part 'a' of a questions wants to know the torque on something, then in part 'b' they say, using 10 Nm for the value of torque, calculate... blah blah blah.  And 10 Nm wasn't the answer, it was just a generic answer to make sure people could effectively skip a part and not have the whole problem reliant on part 'a.'  I would recommend doing something like that, especially since that makes it easier for you than having to carry through too many errors to give partial credit..| I wish she would make her tests shorter. Her tests are not hard, but there is consistently too much material. It's stressful to be taking a test and see ten minutes left with half the test incomplete. That makes it hard to focus clearly when you're so worried about time.",2017 Fall

The Exams required longer than the allotted period for many students to complete..| Thank you Dr. Gockel for being my instructor and always being respectful to me and the rest of the class. With you being one of the few professors that teaches your subject, its always a coin flip whether you get a good professor or not. You have consistently (i took you for Mechanical Design 1 too) been nice and respectful and knowledgeable on your subject..| Overall my consensus is that she was very nice but I feel like I learned very little in this class, other than from the book and maybe some general concepts..| Great professor. Exams are pretty long.| Thanks for the good semester..| Great class. very interesting to learn. Dr. Gockel did a great job, however sometimes exams can be too long. Overall, very pleased with this class and what I learned.| I felt prepared for this class b/c I took Dr. G for MD1.| I guess my only real complaint with the class was it seemed the exams were late in terms of the materials on them. I have gotten used to the format where material on the exam is taught right up until the class period before the exam is given. Introducing material that will be on the following exam makes it a bit confusing. I think this applied more to the first exam were there was a week between the last bit of the material covered and the exam.

Could be more organized..| One of the best instructors I've had on campus so far. Too bad she's not a professor so that she can teach more courses..| Some of the instructions on things were very vague, I believe if things like ""do not submit this"" or an list of everything needed was provided, the class would have went even smoother.

She never let a student fall behind..| No..| No I do not have any additional comments to give..| I think the class needed more TAs since she frequently had to stop lecturing because she had to help out with people who got behind..| no.| I really enjoyed this class and the professor this semester. Most of the issues I explained are actually not too big of a deal in this class and I was being a bit nit picky since there wasn't too much I would say to improve..| Sara was a good teacher for this engineering course..| The class was easy, but we were always crunched on time. This class is to big to be only three credit hour class..| Instructor Mirmasoudi has an extreme understanding of Solidworks and was always able to assist or fix problems that students came across..| she is very good teacher on classes. same as her I am also using second language life in the US. she English is very good and I can totally understand her. I hope she can keep going she style..| No.| No.| I think she was a very nice teacher and I wish I could be able to T.A. for her..| Her explanation was good but fast and I could not keep up. I know it is because the class got shorter than before and I think the class time should be longer. Some people already had experience using solidworks so it is understandable that class is boring and waste of time but someone like me who never had this kind of class could struggle. I think the class time should be longer but with no attendance required so people who don't get solidworks can learn a lot and people who already know solidworks don't have to waste time..| No..| focus more on clarifying the instructions on the instruction worksheet on the design tasks.",2017 Spring
1482,ME 3600,Allen Jackson,Question 1,"Dr. Jackson is very good with the subject covered in this course. However, I struggled greatly with what he taught. Whatever I got from this course was mostly gained by my studies outside of the classroom..| Poor.| Digresses constantly. Does not elaborate very well..| not very effective.| Class was not effective.| He flat out does not teach. He will ramble for most of the class and expect you to somehow know what to do for homework and exams..| horrible had to learn most of the material on my own examples in class were nothing like the homework based on difficulty and how they were worded.| He is a fairly average professor from a teaching standpoint. He is an engaging person in a small group conversation..| Dr. Jackson is an okay lecturer..| He is a nice individual who likes to see his students succeed and is willing to help. But unfortunately the course itself was not very well taught and he isn't very easy to understand and follow..| Good.| ok.| he is nice and funny, and he care alot about the students.| Good.| Good material.| Not very. Extremely unorganized and dysfunctional class. Extremely boring with no really engaging topics or assignments. Often in class students, myself included, were clueless as to what was going on or being covered in lecture. The book was terrible, full of equations with no clear explanation as to where they came from or how they are used. The beginning of class often never provided an outline to what would be covered during lecture, so the first 15-20 minutes were spent trying to find where in the notes he was going. The notes he posted online from lecture were not posted till after class and were usually just like the book, full of equations with no real explanation on how to use them. Toward the end of the semester the frustration among the students was pretty clear. Students, myself included, stopped showing up to class because they felt that it was a waste of time to sit in class listening for an hour and a half and constantly be confused or lost as to what was going on. When asked questions, his answers were usually very vague and confusing and often ended with a rant talking about ""well in real life you get real data, which never works out ideally so you can't use this data, or this equation...etc"". Cant wait to be done with this class..| a.| not bad.| Not very effective..| While Dr. Jackson is very nice and polite, he does not not seem very helpful. There was a minimum number of functional examples of coursework to prepare for exams. Functional examples would pertain to examples that show step by step how to work problems; most examples were questions with answers, and no explanation of how the answer was derived..| 0.| Dr. Jackson is very intelligent but tends to be a bit monotone. This sometimes distracts some of the students as it is already a semi-uninteresting course. In my personal opinion I think Dr. Jackson would make a great senior design instructor. He has real world experience and asks the tough questions..| Very effective instructor. Extremely knowledgeable..| good.| Seemed to be prepared to have class. Just too much material to learn in one class..| great, very knowledgeable..| Not as effective as I would have hoped. Took a couple of lectures for his microphone to be repaired (?). Though the content of his lectures were somewhat helpful, the Excel programs as worked problems were difficult to analyze. It was also hard to get anything out of the solved solution manual questions he used as examples periodically. His handwritten solutions were much more thorough, but difficult to read..| there was none.| Got stuff done on schedule and had time to help us with problems we were all having troubles with.| Nice guy, obviously intelligent but I had a very hard time learning from him.  Part of the problem was the class setup: I have not had a single scale-up style class that I thought didn't waste a significant amount of time, and this one was no exception.  further, the class size was to large for such a complicated subject, and the TA's appeared to mostly exist to grade homework.  Finally, his use of in-class tech was a constant distraction, from the mic which kept going out mid class to versions of software that wouldn't do what wanted.  I think that the most effective teaching tool he used was solving problems step by step on the overhead projectors (even though his handwriting is atrocious.)   Of all the courses I have taken that had a prerequisite, this is THE ONE that should have had statistics as a prereq!.| Overall fairly effective..| Not very well",2017 Spring

He also had a tough time hearing people..| Went very fast through powerpoints and example problems so it was hard to take notes and pay attention. The problem with using excel is that we see the final answer but have no idea what the equation used to find that answer, also he would go fast though them so they ended up being useless because I couldn't follow along with him going so fast..| not well. i was always lost.| through email out of class and in class just announced.| not well-  I sometimes think he had an assumption of content on my part that was definitely above my current level..| He communicated effectively..| Not very well",2017 Spring

Twice, our group had to switch out DAQ components because they weren't working properly (THEY'RE BRAND NEW!!). In another lab, Dr. Jackson came by our group to answer questions along with one of the LAb TA's and said the setup was correct and that everything was entered properly and at the end of the lab our data turned out to be completely wrong.

1514,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 1,"He is okay..| Well being that this was his first time teaching Matlab it is understandable the he started poorly. He improved lots throughout the semester and if the whole class was taught like it was towards the end, I feel I would have learned a lot more. I feel that it is unfair of how his ineffectiveness at the beginning  of the semester hurt so many grades. Dr. B did teach very well once we started GUI's though and if he keeps that up he will be very effective as an instructor for this course..| pretty effective.| He did a good job of teaching the class. He made it enjoyable even though I am not very good with computers..| 10/10 I loved this class. craig did a great job teaching it.| Professor Baudendistel is a great instructor and his effectiveness was overall presented well..| For teaching the class for the first time, I'd say Craig was an effective instructor. I'm certainly nowhere near the best programmer in the class, but I can say that I have learned a fair amount of programming from this class.| Dr.B was a effective professor but in the beginning of the course he was very fast in his teachings..| He needed to slow down the class cause he thought we know Matlab..| Dr. B was very effective as an instructor.  He was able to easily convey information that I could understand and follow..| Dr. B is a very effective instructor. There were a couple times where his lecture slides did not have the correct information on them..| very effective.| He was decent, however, he often times did not explain fully how to solve a certain type of problem. He would simply show you a question on the board, have you try to solve it, then give you the answer with little or no explanation and then go on to the next question..| Dr. Baudendistel was an enthusiastic and effective instructor, the class was fast paced and hard to follow at times, but he was willing to work with anyone unable to keep up..| Instructor was very effective. Made a difficult class rather enjoyable.| Effective. I would have preferred that he worked through more code in class before he gave us things to work on. I felt like I had no idea what was going on a lot of the time. I really enjoyed how the TAs ran the review sessions because they really worked through problems in a way that was easy to understand. I think Dr. B was far too ambitious on the amount of material that he wanted to cover. I think it is somewhat unreasonable to expect students to do homework during finals week, especially when a large project is due..| he did a good job teaching the class.| The instructor was extremely effective at engaging the class and conveying lecture information..| The instructor was very good at his teaching except for a few things.  The initial portion of the class was expected just slightly higher amount of knowledge from egr 1010.  Egr 1010 did have the matlab content but it was not the main aspect of the class and didn't affect the grade hardly at all.  Resulting from this, most students didn't take matlab as a priority hence not preparing them for ME 1020.  Not always prepped for exams but besides these two points instructor did well conveying material and helping students..| Bit of a rocky start, but the pacing got much better.  Class seemed to be rushed a bit through out the semester, more and different examples would be helpful, especially for reference for the homework.  Pace towards the end of the semester was much better.  Maybe try and integrate the GUI's and project a little earlier.  ODE section felt very rushed.  Overall, nice first semester at 1020.  It will only get better..| Very good even though it was his first time teaching the course.| He is a very good instructor. I would recommend him to anyone..| For having no prior teaching experience with Matlab, Dr. B did an excellent job. He was well-organized and understood the material..| he really tried his hardest so we could under stand the tough material.| One of the best instructors I've ever had. When nearly the entire class failed his first exam, he offered a make-up and changed his tactics. Most other instructors I know would be too self-centered to admit that their teaching or evaluation methods were flawed..| He was very helpful and I learned a lot. The start of the class was rough due to it being his first time but he worked with the class to know how best to teach the class..| Great.| Dr. B is a very effective professor.  He has an amazing ability to adapt to any problem and give assistance..| 4/5 stars. Very nice guy, hes a good professor, but he would tend to make exams longer and harder than they need to be. He would set us up for failure many times in class, which I do not always agree with..| He was a great instructor for this course and was very informative. You can tell that he loved what he taught..| poor.| Craig knows his stuff very well  and is always enthusiastic. Very fun to learn from..| The beginning was rough since I had no idea how to code in matlab and no experience with syntax but around halfway through I was able to understand the lessons and learn a lot. It helped a lot when he started the lesson by dragging us through either an example code or the first code in a series of codes.",2017 Spring
1515,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 2,"Yes.| I have no opinion on this because once I feel I was taught better my grades reflected it, but at the beginning of the semester I learned nothing, was plain confused the whole time, and spent countless hours trying to figure it out..| yes.| Yes he did!.| yes.| He based the work based on the course syllabus. However there were times where the work was large and the time was not available..| Yes.| Dr.B did evaluate my work based on the expectations described in the course syllabus..| NO! he kept pushing us even though we didn't understand the section. HE never slowed down t let us learn the material..| Yes..| The grades received for different assignments were based on the expectations in the syllabus..| yes.| Yes, he evaluated fairly and how I expected..| Dr. Baudendistel would evaluate work based off of the syllabus and would deviate from it only when he had already cleared it with the class..| yes.| Yes.| yes.| All coursework was graded clearly, in accordance with the syllabus..| Yes.| Yes, very adaptable to student's needs as well..| Yes.| Yes he did..| yes.| yes he did.| Yes..| Yes. and how hard we worked.| Yes.| the syllabus was accurate throughout the year.| Yes, he did..| Yes, the syllabus made it very clear what the expectations for this class were and the grade breakdown..| no.| Yes..| Yes, the syllabus detailed how the work would be graded and that outline was followed throughout the semester.",2017 Spring
1516,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 3,"Yes.| Yes.| yes.| Yes he did!.| yes.| Yes.| Yes, honestly I think this should have been an 80 minute class rather than 55 minutes because we used every bit of class we time we had, and could've used more.| Dr.B started class on time and used the full class period..| Yes.| Yes..| He usually started class on time. Sometimes he got carried away and did not realize that the class time was over and would continue teaching. Someone would have to notify him that the class time was over..| yes.| Class was always started on time..| The class always started on time and would run the entire time block..| yes.| Yes.| always.| The instructor was timely and punctial;classes regularly began and finished on time.| yes.| yes..| Yes.| Class always started on time and always went the full length..| yes.| he used the full class time to the best of his capabilities, and even spent extra time if we needed it..| Yes. I recommend scheduling this class for longer periods in the future. 55 minutes was too short, I would be okay with 80 minute periods 3 days per week..| Yes.| Yes.| class was always started on time.| Yes, sometimes we would accidentally go over time, since it is only a 55 minute class..| Yes, he started class on time everyday, and used the entire class time period..| the class time was spent inefficient but he was on time and was teaching whole period.| Yes.| Yes. Though I would have liked more time to look over the material before class. We only have an hour so if we could look over material before hand it might help a bit.",2017 Spring
1517,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 4,"He is okay..| He demonstrated this by adapting the class to how it should have actually been from the start..| interesting projects and demonstrations.| He was always open for questions and had extensive office hours.| he offered office hours, gladly answered any questions asked in class and reviewed anything the students had trouble understanding.| Yes, he always asked for questions from the students and had activities during class..| Craig pushed us to apply prior knowledge to each task we learned throughout the semester, and tried to give examples of how you could apply these skills to the outside world.| Dr.B showed a lot of interest in my learning..| He didn't!.| Dr. B would occasionally work with the other TA's to help out the students with the errors in their code..| He made sure to teach us what companies would like to see people to have. Also he gave us real world applications for the different topics..| yes.| He made plenty of office hours which I found to be of great help..| Dr. Baudendistel wanted to make sure that all the students in the class were able to understand the topics explained in class..| Instructor was readily available for questions and gave lots of help when asked.| Dr B was extremely enthusiastic and I really appreciated his interest in the field and he always made sure to relate what we were learning to the field.| he answered all questions we had and was available in office hours for any further explanation.| The instructor was extremely engaged in students' learning, providing feedback, asking questions that prompted critical thinking, and was responsive to the pace of the class..| yes.| Showing and using practical examples, almost all applied examples..| Yes.| He was very passionate about what he was teaching us. He gave lots of help when needed..| Dr. B always addressed any questions sincerely and answered them in a comprehensible manner..| he tried the best he could to help each and every student given the size of the entire class.| Hard to explain. Dr. B. never insulted your intelligence. If you had an issue, he would explain it until you understood it, within the time constraints of the class period..| He is helpful and answer emails to point us in the right direction.| He was always excited to teach and willing to help if anyone had trouble understanding..| real world examples were always provided to prove the importance of the class.| He would show us cool things you can do with Matlab, and will show you how to do something in Matlab while being polite..| He was always very energetic during class making even the most boring material interesting, and he was almost always available after class to help on a problem with the programing..| did not interest me.| He made everything as interesting as it could be. He made coding less of a chore.| seeing how we can create programs to represent real world problems helped a lot.",2017 Spring
1518,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 5,"Effectively.| He communicated amazingly. There were times when I would email him at 11:30pm and he would respond at 11:31 pm..| very effectively.| Very well..| very well.| He communicated well..| Craig is very good about communicating what we need to know inside and outside of class.| Dr.B effectively communicated in and out of the classroom allowing me to email him whenever I had a problem with the material..| OK.| He communicated very well in the classroom as well as outside the classroom during office hours..| He told us when everything was due and told us when he fixed different homework questions. He was not always 100% clear about when assignments were due. Homework was not due on a normal schedule..| yes.| He communicated well..| Dr. Baudendistel tried his best to understand the material for the first time well enough to explain it to the class, but do to him learning the material along with the class, some of the topics seemed unreasonably difficult or cumbersome at times..| Communicated very effectively. Generally responded to emails quickly and was readily available to answer questions.| very well.| he communicated well on everything.| All course communication, whether via pilot, email, or verbal was clear and effective..| very well.| Very well, in and out..| Yes.| He communicated very well!.| perfectly.| he communicated quite well in and outside of class.| Very well, both in and out of class with emails and Pilot updates..| He was very helpful and would answer questions and emails..| Very Well.| homework was frequently put up late and grading was slow at best.| He did very well with communication. He uses Pilot frequently unlike a lot of professors. Polite in the classroom, and used a loud voice so people could hear..| Almost everything that he needed the class to know they did know, because e got the information out to us as soon as possible..| he sent me email couple times and he answered question when I asked both inside and outside of the class room..| Craig is very quick  to answering in, and out of the classroom..| very friendly.

1519,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 6,"Yes.| After about half way through yes, the first half no. At the beginning I though it was the most unorganized class I had ever taken in my life. I felt like I had no chance of even getting a C. Luckily the class changed..| yes.| Yes they were!.| yes.| Yes.| I would say so, once again this was his first time teaching the class and I also came into this with very little coding experience so from what I could tell the content was organized.| The course content and lectures were well organized..| No!.| Yes. The notes followed a similar format during the week. This was a welcome as it was easy to understand the main points and details that mattered..| Lectures were organized well..| well organized with there were some reference sheets on pilot.| They were well organized however, they could use more explanation before diving into solving a problem..| The content was well organized, but was not always as thoroughly explained as some would like do to time restraints of the fifty minute time block..| yes.| Very well.| they were well organized. The exam schedule and content was sort of made up as the class went on, but it was laways well-organized when presented..| For the most part, the lectures were well organized. Several sections seemed rushed, with too little exposition into the ""why"" or ""how"" of a method, particularly the sections upon numerical methods. Some important examples from class were absent from the posted notes( particularly the GUI section), which caused some confusion preparing for exams.  The assigned homework was relevant to the current topics, and helped to reinforce the lecture material..| 9/10.| Yes, though at times a little rushed..| Yes.| Yes, everything was neatly organized and prepared for us..| yes.| the content and lecture were well organized, and easy to understand.| Yes. It could be better organized in the future, which I'm sure Dr. B. will fix..| Yes.| Yes.| lectures were well thought out but occasionally hard to follow.| Yes, they were very organized..| The class had a great structure to it and allowed it to be easily learned..| kind of.| Yes.| other than we needed the computers updated and couldn't do anything at one point the lectures did what they needed to.",2017 Spring
1520,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 7,"Yes.| Yes.| yes.| Yes he was!.| yes.| Yes.| Craig is incredibly available and responsive, even late at night. One time an email I sent around 11:30pm was answered in minutes. And if he wasn't available for some reason, his two TAs were equally as available and helpful.| Dr.B was reasonably available on most occasions..| Yes!.| Yes.  I liked how he was available near the EGR 1010 help room..| He was responsive and available..| yes.| He was reasonably available but his TA's were more available and always helpful..| Dr. Baudendistel was always available during his office hours and even outside of them on most occasions, he was always available through email, even late at night..| yes.| Yes, very well.| the most available professor i've ever had.| The instructor was available online, during office hours, and outside of office hours as well..| yes.| More than any professor I've had so far..| Yes.| Yes, he was available all the time..| yes.| He made himself frequently available for us students..| Yes..| Yes.| Yes.| office hours were plentiful and useful.| Yes, he was.

1521,ME 1020,Craig Baudendistel,Question 8,"He is okay..| Any comments I said were not meant to be hurtful. You taught the class great at the end and I completely understand it being your first time teaching it. I just wish I could have done better in the beginning of the class so I didn't hurt my GPA..| class was very interesting and I learned a lot. However the work load towards the end of the semester was pretty rough on top of a full engineering schedule. The project was hard to do while still keeping up on exams and homework. One or the other may have been more effective..| He was one of the best professors I had this semester.| As one who isn't super tech savvy and doesn't know a whole lot about computers and programming and all things computer science, this class was a bit more challenging for me than others, but I feel with the help provided I was able to be successful enough and I have learned a thing or two about coding. I wish the review sessions had been at times when I was available, but posting the review sheets and solutions on Pilot did help. Craig is a very kind and understanding guy, so I felt less intimidated to ask questions which was nice. The written portion for the exams were a nice way to earn points for those who struggle a bit with the actual computer portion. Being able to get help from others at the table was helpful. Overall, fun semester. P.S. Please build an Iron Man suit, you look like Tony Stark and I'm sure you're more than capable of figuring out how to build one.| Dr.B for being his first time teaching this course, he was a good professor..| He was not a very good teacher!.| No..| He put extra time and effort in to making sure he knew the information that he was teaching. The final project was a lot of work and it was hard to focus on working on that and other homework and the work for other classes..| none.| Exams are not usually too hard but I always felt that the exams were a bit too long for the class period. I often felt myself rushing and making simple mistakes just to finish on time. I would even leave mistakes knowing they were there just because I did not have enough time to fix them on occasion..| Dr. Baudendistel did a good job instructing this class for the first time, but it needs work and a little more planning before teaching another..| no.| no.| I will always sign up for his classes, awesome teacher..| Instructor is doing well and did very well for first year teaching.  Experience throughout his teaching career will definitely make him even better.  Other recommendation is to maybe start python just slightly earlier so their is more time for practice..| Wish I could take him again next semester. Great prof, great guy. Very intelligent.| great teacher.| He has a good base on how the class needs to be taught and tests structured. Now its only experience is needed..| He was a very engaging instructor and I was very happy to be able to take any class that he would teach. He's also very knowledgeable and down to earth allowing him to be very approachable..| I believe the class could use a recitation..| Might need to hold back on some of that homework.

1522,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 1,"Honestly, not as effective as I would have hoped. I felt like a lot of stuff was glossed over and I had to go hunting through the text to make sense of what happened during lecture. Like I was getting just pieces of the puzzle, but I didn't really know what the puzzle was supposed to look like in the first place..| He was important to my learning of the topics and material of the course..| The course could have been better if the lecture is well prepare. I feel like the subjects is not organize and some time I got confuse between chapters..| Overall Dr. Mian is only moderately effective. He is very disorganized and inconsistent in the quality and relevance of the material. He has poor attention to detail and is not a stellar communicator..| I have taken Dr. Mian twice and I have been let down both times. He simply does not explain things in an organized or clear manner. Attempting to take notes in class is difficult and you cannot piece together the information later when reviewing notes because it is so scattered..| This i the third class Ive had Dr. Mian for. That being said, I knew what to expect coming in to the semester and got exactly what I expected. I feel he genuinely cares about his students and wants to be a good professor, but when it comes down to it he can't effectively teach. The lectures are all over the place and we seldom go over 2 problems in class even when the whole class period is set to be ""example time"". The heavy emphasis on Simulink is ridiculous when he (a professor who already isnt an effecient instructor) gives us a half-effort lecture on how to use Simulink's basic functions, then expects us to do complex homework problems. Then comes the next big problem, the TA homework graders. I have done everything correct on homework assignments and still gotten 80% of the points because of arbitrary mark-offs in the middle of my work. Even when it matches his homework solutions after the fact..| not great.| Class time was not well spent. Many times the objective of the lecture was unclear, and Dr. Mian was often stumbling upon his thoughts. It never felt like he had organized note but rather was improvising some lecture just to spend the entire class time..| Fairly effective. Often seemed quite unprepared for teaching the class. Examples were not consistently clear, and occasionally used some confusing wording and explanations..| Very poor.| Dr. Mian is a very solid professor. He takes the time to do quite a few examples to go along with his lectures and frequently asks for questions to make sure the class understands the material being presented..| I learned from this instructor, but it was difficult to keep myself engaged, because I felt like I didn't know what all to write in my notes. the pattern of the class was eccentric, and he gave us information in a lot of different ways, like the whiteboard or the tablet. It was hard to follow his thought process..| The professor did not use class time wisely and, for much of the material, I had to work with others in the class to try and learn the material ourselves..| Not the most clear and effective, but it could be worse..| make this form stop popping up every time i log into pilot.| I believe that Dr. Mian did a pretty good job at effectively teaching me the material. I took him twice this semester and am glad that I did..| Not to bad.| Alright. Lecture was normally productive. Sometimes though when jumping back to a previous chapter for no apparent reason did it became confusing since that chapter was done and we were will into the next one..| Good.| Very good teacher..| Hard to understand.| Overall the concepts came across. He tended to skim matrial a bit. Going a little to fast over some subjects. He would pause and give us time to think, but when he was going over things already written out on the projector, that was when he would go a biy fast..| Dr. Mian is easy to understand and very good at explaining the material in class.

I would solve it on the homework the way we had learned in class and no matter how much effort I had put forth, my home work grades/quiz grades would suffer. I had only solved certain things the way he had explained them..| Yes..| The quiz and homework grades were a complete crap shoot. you either get a 70 or a 10.  You never knew.| Yes. The syllabus outlined the class very closely and there was nothing that deviated from material that was stated in the document..| Yes.| The instructor graded the exams the way that was described in the syllabus. The homework and the quizzes were graded so horribly, I could have taken half of my quizzes back to him to get re-graded because they were graded so badly. There was a quiz that said, ""What do the terms 'System' and 'Dynamics' mean to you?"" and I got a 30% on the quiz even though the answer should be completely subjective based on the problem statement.

Often times a bunch of us would get different quiz scores but when cross checking the quizzes, the points he had taken off did not align with each quiz. It felt he was grading each one on a different scale.| No..| Very solid professor..| I think switching back and forth between the screen and the whiteboard disrupt the flow of the class. I would suggest using one of those materials per lecture, but shy away from using both, unless you plan on switching for the rest of the lecture..| No.| Enjoyed the class and the teacher..| No.| It was annoying when the online quizzes had a 20 minute time limit.

He is hard to follow, understand, and pay attention to..| Excellent.| Instructor is hard to understand and not very well organized. Lectures did not provide anything beneficial in terms of learning..| He was effective in my learning. I don't feel that this class was very necessary sometimes, as we would not learn new things during class but review things that were leaned in previous courses..| Fine.| I didn't need to show up to 1 class for anything this semester. The people who came in to talk were boring and just talked about stuff we've done in other classes. He didn't communicate on due dates so some things snuck up on us. He also didn't make evryone turn in their PowerPoint at the same time so some groups has an extra week and a half to complete their PowerPoint and that's not right. We also had to go the first day so we didn't get to see what the PowerPoint should look like and other groups did. A Dropbox for the PowerPoint should have been put up the morning of the presentations  so that people couldn't make improvements and they all would have had the same due date to complete it..| He was very effective at explaining what we were supposed to be doing outside of class, as well as making sure we were doing everything..| ineffective.| Not very effective.| good.| Not very effective..| he is the best instructor in this course.| Good.| As this is his first time teaching the class, there have been issues with communication of deadlines, but overall he has been a good professor..| a.| so effective.| Good.| Dr. Mian did a great job for being his first time teaching senior design.

The class could be boiled down to two weeks where we cover how to write a proposal. I get nothing from the lectures and all of the assignments seem like busy work. This should be a freshman level class, not a capstone class. Anyone who has a real job (the majority of the class) has already had to do the things we learn at their job.

I loved how his class was set up for us to do MATLAB problems with him, and in between each problem he as well as a TA would walk around to make sure we understand the process for each technique.

1561,ME 3360,Scott Thomas,Question 8,"no.| No..| Overall the class is taught very well. The only thing that is hard is sometimes things either get going to fast or we get to sidetracked in the class..| no.| My one major criticism of how Dr. Thomas formats his courses is with the homework. All of the students appreciate getting the worked out answers to the homework because that allows us to move forward when we are stuck and to help have extra examples from which to learn. I personally think that doing homework without knowing the correct answer only causes people to practice incorrect methodology, as they don't know if they did it correctly or if they need to revise their method, and only perfect practice makes perfect. But because of how long the homework problems became in the end, mixed with how many problems were assigned, many people had to rely on copying the answers quickly because there was not enough time to finish the homework on their own. This is compounded by the fact that we often learned crucial information in the class before the homework was due, meaning we effectively had one and a half days to do most of the homeworks unless we just copied. Also, having to scan in the homework and bring it to class was never helpful to me and it added a significant burden to preparing and finishing my homework..| The one thing I don't like about the lectures is that a talkative student can disrupt the entire class period. I like that Dr. Thomas encourages questions, but sometimes we spend way too much time on questions from individuals that should be handled in either office hours or by e-mail..| Actually looking forward to Thermo II, if that's possible..| Keep it up Scurvy Scott!!.| No.| I would recommend this professor to anyone pursuing an engineering degree. I have enjoyed every class I have had with him..| Only real issue I had was when the first homework was due. A few people had never had Dr. Thomas before and did not realize he did homework online. Although it was outlined in the syllabus, he forgot to mention it during the first class causing a few people get 0% on their first homework. For reference, I had Scott previously and was familiar with this policy, but there were a handful of individuals who weren't..| Great experience! Thank you Dr. Thomas!!!!!.| It might be worth going through and reviewing the questions for Chapter 12 homework. As I was going through it and the posted solutions, I kept finding equations that I had no idea where they came from until we started Chapter 13. I assume this is in part due to the similar nature of 12 and 13 but it made for a very frustrating time when I couldn't find the formulas being used in the answers. The only other thing is I felt chapter 12 was much harder than chapter 13. Chapter 13 I was actually making sense of and felt I had a decent understanding of after class time and working through the homework..| I really enjoyed my time this semester learning with Dr. Thomas, and I am looking forward to continuing to work with him in the fall in another course!",2017 Spring

Thank you for a good semester..| The only complaint I have is that sometimes he would mention something ""one"" time during a lecture and give no example on it or give any further explanation on it (so you would think its not relative, important) but then he would put it on the exam to trip up the students. That is not fair..| I thought the course was really good, some side story and more animation of the subject would be nice. The class is very enjoyable, (I have some class where student just come in and take note and it really dry).| recording the lecture and not giving a grade on the homework were a brilliant idea.

The book was a complete waste of money for homework and tests..| Effective, seemed passionate about his topic.| Great.| Dr. Dan Young is a little bit goofy, but he genuinely enjoys teaching and seems to want to help students as much as possible..| good.| a.| great professor.| Probably the most effective teacher at teaching concepts, which made the class interesting and informative. Dr. Young made this class that was a technical elective I was not interested in, very interesting. I took a lot of knowledge I did not expect to take from this class..| fantastic.| I think Dr. Young did a great job. I like how he utilized every lecture to the fullest. I live an hour away and value my time in class. Dr. Young delivered the material in a way that was able to be understood from the lecture notes and reading the book. The book had a more detailed way of understanding the material, which made lecture more understandable if the reading was done before class..| Extremely effective. Not only taught the material well but included relevant bits of knowledge from his personal experiences..| Very effective..| He is very cooperative and explain the sibject in a very good manner that student could really understand the complete concept The way he teach things from basic   help the children to learn the things more efficiently.

Confused me on quizzes from information that was used, or just tangential information he just said..| yes.| The classes were well organized, but for me personally, the set up of interactive classes does not work very well, as it is more of a teach-yourself the material kind of environment where the professor is there more so to clear things up and for short lectures. This sometimes makes it difficult to actually learn the material correctly..| Somewhat. Perusall, in my opinion, is a good idea but not effective. Online textbooks are just a bad idea in general..| Yes, Dr. Srinivasan had well organized lectures and course content all on the pilot website..| Yes.| To some degree due to the class format.| No, annotations were a nightmare.

It was just boring and not really informative..| the perusall annotation software is a joke.| No..| The instructor knows what he is doing. But the class methodology is not very good. Perusall is too easy to cheat. Too many people just copied the first definition of a word from Wikipedia and pasted it in the text. Sometimes multiple people highlighted the same word and pasted the exact same definition. It shows exactly how much effort they put into the class. I haven't seen their grades, but I bet they got A's on all their Perusall assignments while I was actually putting in effort to get B's and C's.  Because of Perusall being easy to cheat and the quizzes being simple, I feel like we didn't learn anything.  My recommendation is to change the class to a physical book and doing more traditional classroom work..| Nope..| No.| No.| I do not like the ""step-up"" learning method. I feel more comfortable with traditional styles of teaching, like doing examples and students asking questions. To me step-up education felt a lot like taking an online course. You are basically 100% on your own with the material. The instructor does little to no lecture, you just read the textbook and do assignments. I once asked for assistance or to see an example and I was told that there are examples in the book (no help help or explanation was provided). The student to professor ratio is way off in these courses. I feel as though Wright State will move to more of this style of classroom due to their financial troubles, which is a shame for the students. We are not receiving a quality education for what we are paying by providing us with this. Sure, I am getting an easy passing grade in the class because it has been dumbed down due to the style of teaching, but I am actually learning nothing. Which is kind of scary when you are pumping out graduating classes every year of engineers who have not been taught everything properly. We will not be taking a final exam in this course thankfully because the entire class would fail it, but I would be interested to see just how bad the scores would be if there were a final exam. You could check the effectiveness of step-up education by giving us a final or pop-quiz at the end of the semester.",2017 Spring

I always felt like I understood the concepts and could do the problems.| The teacher teaches the class a bit differently than the other teachers, but taught it very well.

1622,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 5,"Well. Expectations were always clear and he did a good job of explaining the material..| The professor seemed to not like emails. He seemed to discourage ""bothering him"" with questions over email. In class he would talk about sending ""pointless"" emails, which deterred me from trying to communicate with him out of the classroom. He did not seem open to extra communication out of the classroom..| Very responsive within reason, if you emailed him a question regarding something stated in lecture he wouldn't respond. I know because he would describe his hilarious emails that he got and share them with the class, he always kept the students anonymous though. If you asked a reasonable question he would explain and answer it clearly, and in a timely manner..| Very Effectively.| well.| Very effective.| great.| very effectively.| Good.| communicated well..| Very well..| Very, very well..| In the classroom I think he communicated well. I never know about outside of class..| Communication with this instructor is great. He is very helpful inside and outside of the classroom. One-on-one help was fantastic during office hours..| He DID NOT like to receive emails!! He would call out the students that sent him emails to complain about them.  So, not the best to communicate with!.| not effective, ignored students emails, when he was emailed and read them he would come to class and point that student out in front of the class and make it clear how stupid their email was and that he should not recieve and emails like that again..| effectively.| ten out of ten.| Dr. Amer always started class with announcements, if there were any that day. He emailed the class as needed if there was something that needed to be clarified or changed..| I would have liked a little clearer communication about if and when assignments were going on Pilot, but most things went pretty smoothly..| He was very effective with communication..| A very good communicator: able to relate complicated topics in easy to understand ways!.| Fairly effectively. There were times when I was unsure of what was due or if there was a quiz or not, but otherwise he communicated well.| well.| He never answered emails and he would call you out in front of the class if you emailed him about any questions. Other than that, he was decent..| Dr. Amer was very effective with communicating to the class..| Not very.| Very effective. no-nonsense teacher who was direct and concise with his lectures.

Great way to structure a class.| yes.| Yes.| of coarse.| almost always.| yes..| Yes..| Yes, the requirements and expectations were clearly listed and taught in a particular order..| I believe so. It went in an order that we were able to understand and accomplish. He was able to time everything out very well..| Yes..| For the most part, yes..| no. not at all..| yes.| well organized.| Dr. Amer had his pilot organized very simple and easy, which is very nice. Lecture was well organized by doing announcements, notes and problems, and then reiterating what was covered in class and the objectives of the material we just learned..| The instructors handwriting was a bit hard to read at times, and the instructor spoke a bit quietly, but after some quick adjustments on my part it was not a problem..| Yes..| Yes, lectures were very organized..| nice and straight forward.| Yes.| yes.| Yes..| Yes..| Not really.| Yes, All content was posted outside of class notes..| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| yes.| Yes.| Yes, however notes could have been more organized.| Yes, the content and lectures was well organized.",2017 Spring
1624,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 7,"Yes.| I never tried to contact the professor through any of these means.

1625,ME 3310,Maher Amer,Question 8,"Dr. Amer called people out during class in two instances that I noticed he should not have. He stopped during lecture to ask someone if they were registered with ODS. He also called me out for taking a make-up exam in front of the class, knowing that I had undergone a traumatic experience that caused me to need to make it up. He was contacted through Student Support Services..| The professor did well in instructing the class. However, I hope in the future he is more open to emails and willing to be more open about expectations for exams. In doing so, students would be capable of studying more effectively for the topics on the exams..| AWESOME!! PROFESSOR AMER IS THE BEST!.| Amazing professor and I hope to take more courses with him!.| no.| Enjoyed being in this class and would take this instructor again..| HE IS FUNNY AF.| My only suggestion is to have more quizzes. If a student were to get 2 or 3 of the large point quizzes wrong, it becomes impossible to get the required 60% minimum average for the quiz section. Because most of the 10 quizzes are 5 or 10 points, messing up one 50 point quiz would give you the same score as a student that just chose not to do 5 of the smaller ones. Which does not really seem fair. When each quiz took about equal amounts of time and effort to complete..| Great professor, very practical..| I was only disappointed with the class during the Final for two reasons: one, that the formula sheet provided was not very useful, and two that 50/100 points of the exam were in a question that (to my knowledge) was never covered by the homework.   All the questions needed at least one formula that was not on the formula sheet.  Having a formula sheet suggests that students can focus on studying theory, but on the final this was not the case.  I have done very well in this class up to that point.  I feel like my abilities on the final were not properly assessed, and that being able to properly use a given formula is more important than whether or not you bet on memorizing the correct formulas.  I, apparently, did not 'bet' on having formulas like Polytropic Work at the ready for the final. I'm not trying to place the blame on Dr. Amer, nor am I insinuating that he attempted to ""pull a fast one"" on the class.  From a student perspective, however, I felt unprepared for the final for silly reasons instead of lack of study..| I think he is a little intimidating in class. The way he would answers would come off as mean. It hindered me from asking questions a time or two. He always welcomed questions though..| Dr. Amer not only instructed me on the material of Thermodynamics, he also showed me that I LOVE the subject. I hope I have the opportunity to take more of his classes in the future..| I would take another class with him.  But hopefully he will get better on responding to emails, and office hours!.| bad, boring class, hanging on by a thread..| no.| Great instructor. Very fair, would take a class with him again..| No..| I love Thermodynamics..| my favorite instructor in the entire university by far. the only negative thing i would have to say is that when it is test time he says he wants you to study everything for the test but he doesnt put everything on the tests. when the tests only have 3 questions and you really mess one up you get a bad grade..| Good instructor",2017 Spring

He isn't the best teacher I've had but he always has passion to help the kids and teach the subject and that's what more teachers need. I feel like I learned a lot from him throughout the semester and I'm thankful I had him for that..| Overall hes a good teacher and a nice guy. But he has very high expectations for his students. I do also believe the homework should be weighted a bit more. Exams are 90% of our grade and homework, quizzes and a design project were only worth a combined 10%..| no.| Nope.",2017 Spring

Kinematics is an interesting subject and he did a good job to keep it that way..| All the information was there... IF you could keep up..| Decent to good effectiveness. Some topics were vague/confusing..| did not seem too interested in teaching the subject.| Very clear that he is a new professor. His ability to explain things could use improvement..| Pretty effective.| God awful. The worst overall class ive taken at wright state. Professor talked extremely quiet and did not explain material. The final class project was extremely vague and could essentially be boiled down to ""design something"".

Horrible professor horrible class. i would wish this class on my worst enemies.| Very effective.| He just got his PhD, so he was new. Much of the homework was too difficult and I didn't get much out of it. Because I didn't do well on the homework, I still had trouble when it came time for exams. The reviews before the exams were very useful however..| Too difficult- hard to learn.| A good instructor. It's my understanding that this is his first semester teaching. I think he did okay for it being his first time. After a few more semesters he'll be very good..| Dr. Gobal spent a lot of time on graphical methods that are impractical and useless. I understand it was his first time teaching the course, however, he should consider teaching the material that we can actually use. This is especially true considering Kinematics is an elective course..| The book taught me better than he did, and all he did was read parts of the book aloud..| Professor was good at explaining the subject but the examples explained in the class weren't sufficient to solve the homework. Questions from the comparatively tough to what we have learned in the class. Need more hard work of students to get average score in the exams. The time provided was not sufficient for solving the type of questions given..| teaching method is good, proper planning for every classes, make revision of all topic after end of the chapter. finally, he has given his good effort to teach his subject..| Dr. Gobal is very helpful. His teaching methodology is extremely well organized. He explains every topic followed by an example, which gives proper understanding of that topic..| Dr. Gobal taught the course very well.

1689,ME 7340,Jose Camberos,Question 8,"Overall Dr. Camberos is highly knowledgeable in the field of CFD. However, I don't think his expectations of Wright State Students are where they should be. This one of our highest level thermal-fluids classes. In the final two weeks, we arrived at the equations of fluid mechanics. By comparison, other universities are there at week 4. Maybe this isn't a problem with Dr. Camberos' teaching style though. The department could easily speed this class up by making the advanced engineering math class a prerequisite. Finite differences and PDEs are covered in great detail the math class. It is a waste of Dr. Comberos's time and ours to cover PDE solutions and simple finite differences. Of course, these techniques applied to the equations of fluid mechanics should be covered in great detail. Aside from making an additional class period, I enjoyed Dr. Camberos' class. But I really think the ME department should consider restructuring the CFD class to be more in line with other universities..| No..| no.| No.| Recombine the first two homework assignments. This may help to get through all the material. Also give the intro to the project at least a month before it is due, when you only give a week, it is just a huge homework assignment and students cannot budget time to do it well so close to the end of the semester when everything else is occurring, i.e., other class projects, thesis defenses, etc..| As a precursor to the following statements, I had no CFD knowledge prior to this course.  My fluids knowledge was limited to undergraduate Fluid Mechanics. Several improvements can be made to the structure of this course that would benefit the students.  A signficant amount of time was spent on finite difference theory.  The class spent quite a while on deriving finite differences.  Including how to derive the finite difference equation from a Taylor Series Expansion and how the finite difference can be used to discretize the governing PDEs.  This could be condensed into half-a-class (40 minute) review.  This should be covered in the pre-reqs, and is covered in other classes as well.  I did not have all the pre-reqs for the class, but I have taken EGR-7030 and MTH-6050. •	EGR-7030: Covers during the finite difference equations and the use of various numerical methods (i.e. Runge-Kutta). •	MTH-6050: Covers the analytical solution of PDEs using Fourier series and introduces solving PDEs numerically using the finite difference methods.  Also teaches the Crank-Nicolson method for Laplace equations. Stability analysis is not covered in these classes, so that should be kept in the class.  This is relatively simple and should be able to be taught in one class period. The more advanced finite difference methods (i.e. DuFort-Frankel, Lax-Friedrich, Lax-Wendroff) should still be covered as they are not covered in the other classes.  However, with the pre-req knowledge students should be able to easily understand how the equation was discretized, how it was modified after discretization (i.e. let u_j = 0.5*[u_j+1 + u_j-1]).  The majority of the time on these equations can spent on showing that the modifications lead to favorable stability characterisitics. All of the above should be able to be accomplished fairly quickly.  The application of these methods should be demonstrated in class. It would be helpful to the class if these methods were coded up by the instructor during class and the class could follow along since we were in a computer lab.  This could be accomplished quickly for a simple 1D example. A much greater amount of time needs to be dedicated to the finite volume methodology.  In the course this semester, finite difference was hammered hard (too hard) and finite volume was very very breifly touched on and then was not covered again until the last two weeks of class when it was time to start working on the project.   Instead, after finite difference is covered (relatively quickly) for 1D problems the finite volume method needs introduced.  The FVM process needs to be described thoroughly and methodically as it is very unlikely the FVM method is covered is any other course (unlike finite difference).  Then, the  equivalent of all the FD schemes needs to be implemented in class.   Granted the FVM won’t be much different from the FDM for 1D problem it is probably the most logical place to introduce it. Extension to 2D problems will be relatively simple for the FDM method, but it should still be covered in a way that students can see how the algorithms are extended in a second direction.  This was they can easily extend the algorithms to a third dimensions on their own if needed in the future.  This is where the most time on the FVM should be spent as it will show the difference between the FDM and FVM method more clearly.  Additionally, it wasn’t covered in this class but how to solve a problem on an unstructured grid, using the FVM, should be taught.  As I understand it, this is one of the largest benefits of the FVM method.  Also, sinc e the FVM is the most widely used in practice, it only makes sense this should be covered more thouroughly. Additionally, I think the full Navier-Stokes equations should be introduced in the first week of class.  This isn’t unreasonable, as it was done in the first week of Convective Heat and Mass Transfer.  This way students can see the full level of physics that are being modeled.  Then as start learning in 1D, incompressible, inviscid example we can be shown how the NS equations are simplied to reach the governing PDEs for this case.  Then when we move to 2D, then compressible, then viscid we can do the same thing and see what simplifications are made to the NS equations to reach the governing PDEs for that case.  I feel this would help a lot especially when we get to the Euler equations and we start using flux vectors.  This makes it significantly easier to understand what each component of the state vector and the flux vectors means.  With an understanding of that, will come a much better understanding of the Euler equations and solution methods for them. More time should be spent on flux vector splitting.  The different ways in which it can be split, what this means physically and mathematically, when it is and isn’t necessary, and how it is implemented in both the FDM (studied first, but quickly) and then the FVM (studied in more detail). The time spent on each portion of the class material didn’t seem adequately distributed.  Far too much time was spent on simple to understand concepts which are either partially or totally covered in pre-reqs, and not enough time was spent on actual CFD applications rather than just numerical methods.  If we plotted it with time on the x-axis and material covered on the y-axis, it was almost seem like a linear curve with a very small slope over the first 9 weeks and then the curve suddenly turns exponential and rises very rapidly over the last few weeks.   I feel it should be more of a exponential curve at the beginning quickly covering the simple numerical method type of things (which should be review from pre-reqs) and then when we rich the more advanced material (FVM, Euler equations, etc as decribed above).  The curve should become more linear as we progress more slowly and carefully through the new, more advanced, material we haven’t seen in other classes. Once again, I would like to iterate that I had no CFD experience before this class.  Not in any other classes (except undergraduate Fluid Mechanics) and not in research.  I started learning CFD at the beginning of this course.  I did go beyond the course by watching the ME-702 CFD lecture videos from Boston University on YouTube and working through the 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes python modules during the first two and a half weeks of class.  These are linked in the sources at the bottom.  I feel the ME-702 lecture videos should be more of how the class is structured, but still with more emphasis on the FVM, flux-splitting, and the Euler equations than even the ME-702 lectures presents. This is the highest level of CFD that WSU offers. It is a 7000 level class, but I don’t feel the content is repesentative of that.  Students who take the 7000 classes are driven, capable, students.  I feel WSU needs to be more confident in their students abilities and teach this CFD course at a level that will bring students to a high enough level that they could enter a career based in CFD and perform adequately, albeit at an entry level at first, without a lot of hand holding for their co-workers. Please note that the above is a criticism on the course content and not on the teaching ability of Dr. Camberos.  However, I do have some suggestions how how he may be able to make some changes to his teaching methods that may allow students to understand the content better.  I, personally, have never met a student who has learned material well simply from the instructor lecturing from powerpoints,  especially for a class like this.  I think if the instructor notes were a little more organized and were written up on the board as students followed along would be effective.  The powerpoints could be used as supplemental material which could be reference for graphs, tables, etc., and studied in detail by students in their own time if they don’t have a sufficient understanding of the material from the lecture.  Dr. Camberos relied more on the powerpoints at the beginning of the course, but got much better at writing notes on the board and doing examples toward the end of the course.  Additionally, many of the algorithms are simple enough that they can be coded up together in class.  I think this would be better than providing pre-written code for students to use.  Its very easy to take pre-written code, modify it to make it do something else, without actually understanding how it works.  When I was a senior, for part of my senior design project I wrote a C++ code and GUI that took inputs from the keyboard and trasmitted it wireless to a robot for control.  I knew no C++ at the time and to this day I’m still amazed how I was able to piece it together and get it working from a variety of StackOverflow questions and code snippets without having a sufficient understanding of what was going on.  So for class, I would have a volunteer come up and run the computer to start implementing the code.  The rest of the class can help out in describing how the algorithm can be implemented and the instructor can assist if he sees the class struggling.  I think this would give the class a better understanding of the implementation of each algorithm.  Also, since this is computational fluid dynamics, computational time is important and should be reduced as much as possible.    Granted this isn’t a course teaching how to optimize numerical algorithms or their implementation for speed, but some basic thing should be mentioned.  For example, many of the posted MATLAB examples relied VERY heavily on for loops.  For loops are awfully slow in interpretted languages such as MATLAB and Python and instead vectorized operations should take their place (MATLAB vectors/matrices and Python Numpy).  Granted real CFD takes place in Fortran, C, or C++ for which for loops are still efficient, but as the vast majority of WSU engineering students (unfortunately) do not know these languages, it should at least be mentioned how CFD can be made more efficient in MATLAB (vectorizatoin). Overall, I enjoyed this course. I’ve always been interested in CFD and I greatly enjoyed learning about it.  I just feel like all of us could have learned so much more in the time we had, esepcially with the extra, unscheduled, class on Fridays.  For example, look at the CFD class from Notre Dame (link in sources below).  They are doing Euler Equations by the end of Feburary  (and they started later than us also, Jan. 18th) while we started Jan 9th and we didn’t get to the Euler equations until later March / early April. The CFD content at WSU is far behind other universities. With minor tweaks to Dr. Camberos’ teaching methodology and a major restructuring of the course content, I believe WSU can have one of the best CFD courses in the country. One other thing that comes to mind.  Far too much emphasis is put on writing a report for each homework.  I understand the importance of having strong technical writing skills and I have often heard employers are not satisfied with today’s graduates’ writing abilities.  However, this is not the place to teach that.  Students are paying for a course on CFD.  All teaching emphasis, and especially all grading should be placed on CFD and how well the student is capable of solving CFD problems accurate.  This isn’t the course to grade if a student has proper grammar and writing style, there are WSU courses dedicated solely to that (3000 level technical writing course).  Students would be greatly benefitted by removing the report requirement for each homework and assigning additional CFD problems.  On average, I probably spent 70% of the time writing up the report and only spent 30% of the time actually learning CFD concepts on each homework.   P.S.  Do a “12 Steps to Navier-Stokes” type of module written in MATLAB (since most WSU engineering students only know MATLAB and not Python) would probably work great as a learning tool for the course.

1690,ME 2120,Amir Farajian,Question 1,"His method of ""teaching"" is showing a few key elements in the beginning of lecture for a topic, and then having the class try and figure out the problem by themselves for the remainder of the class. He does not teach. You teach yourself for the course. It's like showing a kid how to ride a bike, then putting him on a Harley Davidson in the middle of the highway. That's how this professor teaches..| Fair effectiveness. Seemed able to answer questions, but read notes straight from his notes as if he hadn't seen the material before..| He followed the book and provided/explained examples from the text, which I found to be very effective..| ugh.| Good.| On a scale from 0 to 5, this instructor receives a 2.5..| exams were completely different from class work.| some how effective. He should try to explain more clearer and precise..| Good explanation of the material, always there to help, good feedback that helps to improve the studying,  alot of examples given and explained..| The instructor does well. Does best to explain all concepts clearly and go back when something makes sense. Is willing to stay on topic if something is not understood, but doesn't linger too long.

The few times he actually did provide lecture on problems he would get confused midway through because he missed a step or did something that was outright wrong. I am not even sure if he knows the subject himself or if he is just learning along the way as we are..| yes.| Yes, they followed the book, chapter by chapter..| dgfh.| Yes.| Organized enough for the class to progress, but there are occasions when the pacing was too fast..| somewhat - exams were fairly different from homework and class work.| Some classes needed to be extended because we did not have enough time to go over some Chapter examples but everything else stayed on track with the syllabus..| Yes, specially the group work was encouraged in this course, learn about others point of views and work together to solve, if there is any mistakes its a great motivation to review it with classmates and learn from it..| Yes.

But the explanation of the subject is not receivable by student like us, because of the way of lecture he delivers is not understandable..| ok, the professor explains the materials ok, the material is hard so i dont think he can does better job than what he did..| good.| He put together good slideshows that were straight out of the book. Didn't have any original material of his own. Also if you don't know how to do Matlab which is the most pointless program ever you are screwed for this class. He doesn't teach at all just goes over examples and has you copy down code. Only 1/4 of the class ever showed up to his lectures. Yells at students when they are struggling with a problem. Bad professor, I didn't learn anything from this class. Am very disappointed that he is teaching machining this fall because I do not want to take him again. How do people like this get their PhD's, cuz he is a horrible teacher. Also I don't know how Wright State considers  any of these courses graduate level courses. I am an undergrad and the whole concept of grad school is bull shit. The work load between undergrad and grad students doesn't differ at all for any of the classes I've been in. Shouldn't grad students have more homework problems, or tougher problems on the exams. There is no difference between the homework or exams at all for any class that is. What a joke..| The professor is good..| goody.| good.| Good.| The instructor is not good, the students can not understand any explanation from him.  The grades were not given for the students.

1754,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 1,"very good.| Very good instructor, lots of examples, clear definition of theory, and real world use of material..| good.| Great.| bad.| Very good.| I feel as though he did a good job in grading and his overall fairness. However, I feel as though I learned next to nothing from this course. All of the material and examples were explained on a high level bird's eye view that gave very little context or detail into how to actually solve the problem or what the purpose of the problem even was. The course also utilized Matlab, and more specifically, Simulink for many different problems. A brief tutorial on Simulink was given near the start of the semester, but very little of the process or problem solving paths for it was explained. Generally, each problem would have some aspect to it that we had never seen before and did not know how to do. This would then be explained later when we asked, but that didn't do anything for the problem we missed because of lack of prior knowledge. I, and I believe most of my peers, routinely felt that we had either, not been taught or hadn't been adequately taught, much of the material that was presented on the quizzes and especially the homework. This defeats the purpose of both the homework and quizzes. The homework and quizzes should be used as practice to refine skills learned in class. Instead, we regularly were unable to do large portions of the homework. Office hours were available, and I understand that if help is needed the student is expected to come to the professor for help, but as an engineering student working a full time job, I do not have extra time to invest in trying to go into office hours every single week. Hundreds and thousands of students spend thousands of dollars each semester for the service of learning, and yet it seems to be expected that those students should be responsible to teach themselves the material with the vague guidance of the professor. This is not the correct method. We, as students, have paid for a service. That service is then frequently sloppily thrown at us. If a half made, luke-warm, $4,000 burger was dropped on your tray at McDonald's wouldn't you be somewhat annoyed. Much of that last paragraph doesn't entirely pertain to the instructor of this course. To be clear, I felt that he was fair and honest with us. I do not feel as though I learned much, but I have had much worse professors. Most of the last paragraph pertains to Wright State as a whole. I believe that changes need to be made by the University to encourage better, more worthwhile instruction and course content. I have very rarely felt that the education I have received has been worth the tuition that I have paid..| Poor ability to relay knowledge. Does not know the material enough to be teaching it..| Overall effectiveness was good. Described difficult topics in a way I could understand.

1794,ME 4520,Subramania Sritharan,Question 1,"The instructor was unclear on most aspects of the taught lessons of each day. There was virtually no instruction on the term paper. Any asked questions were answered with unsatisfactory or vague responses. The TA was very unfair with grading homework assignments..| Good.| Excellent in subject. Satisfactory in delivery..| the instructor was good enough to teach the concepts along with the practical examples.| was good but he need to focus more on fundamental topics so that students can understand more easily..| The professor was at first very motivating and was able to return papers in a good time frame. After two weeks it was clear that our professor struggles with teaching. Throughout this course there was very limited feedback from him and very little resources given to complete homework. In some cases we never even got our homework back, so studying for exams was very challenging. Two weeks into the course the professor deemed the book ""wordy"" and quit using it. In some cases his power-points actually contradicted what was in the book, making it very hard to understand. This teacher was also very unprofessional. The day he handed back our exams ( 1 and 2) he had each of us one by one go up in front of the class and spoke to each of us about how we did. Not only was this embarrassing it wasted half of the class period, time that could have been used to help us understand the material better. He also managed to display our grades for homework 1-4 and the lab to everyone for 20 minuets because he was distracted. There was obvious tension between the professor and his aid Richard. This also lead to some very uncomfortable moments in the classroom. Often times Richard wouldn't do what the professor said and it would take 10-15 minuets for class to get started because of it. Dr. Menard realized there was a problem and was able to fix most of the issues with this course for about 1 day until Dr. Sritharan returned to his normal ways of teaching. When it came to pilot, he rarely knew how to use it and rarely uploaded anything. So if you lost a homework handout you were out of luck because it wouldn't be online and it could take up to 3 weeks to get him to reply to an email. The power-points used in class were distracting and didn't help me understand the material whatsoever. In general Dr. Sritharan was very ineffective in teaching the materiel and took what was thought to be a rather straight forward course and turned it into a nightmare. As a student from another college interested in wright state for grad school (renewable energy program), his performance will make this the first and last course I take at Wright State University.",2016 Summer

The pilot was essentially useless because the professor would forget to upload assignments. For example, exam 2 was over homeworks 5-8 none of witch had been returned. Seeing this problem, the professor said hed post the solutions so we could study them. Well he forgot to post them until a few hours before the exam.

1812,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 11,"I enjoyed how the lecture was structured. The handouts were helpful because they outlined the topics and and routine on how to solve complicated problems in neat fashion..| his teaching is great he explain the subject very good, but his writing is hard to read..| The homework is nothing like the exams and it makes the tests hard to study for..| Professor's knowledge of subject was abundant, was able to answer any questions students had..| Spent a lot of time on the derivation of equations rather than examples of problems. I learn better when I see the equations being used..| Professor explained complex concepts as clearly as can possibly be expected. He checked up on me when I was struggling in the class due to outside challenges..| Great instructor!! always available to answer questions, during office hours or through email with clear and very helpful hints..| was very clear, but more examples with actual numbers would have been more helpful, derivations were interesting the first time but every example done in class was derivations and variables so it was hard to see what was going on most of the time..| Difficult to learn.| We went way too fast in class. I barely could keep up with copying what was on the projector, especially since Sucosky worked on an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper using markers, which filled up pages quickly. As soon as a page was filled, he would get rid of it and get a blank page out immediately. Class was a mad dash to get all of the notes down, without any time to give any thought to understanding what you just wrote down. Some examples would take three pages of paper for him to solve, and if you missed something on the bottom of page 1 you couldn't possibly recover and get anything out of the next two pages. The class was heavily dependent on downloadable worksheets that needed to be printed before class. For students without printers this meant spending lots of money using campus print stations, or trying to find an open seat at the Russ computer labs. If you had a series of classes immediately before this one, you sometimes wouldn't be able to get the worksheets printed at all, because they would sometimes be updated just a few hours before class. I very quickly gave up on the worksheets and just started taking everything down by hand, which made hurrying to get everything written down even more difficult. Examples were complex and hard to follow, and the homework problems often required complex synthesis of equations or theories that we skimmed over in class or simply required information that we were never told. In theory we had a week to do each homework assignment, however we would often not go over all the equations/procedures/theories needed to do the homework until two days before it was due. I ended up teaching myself half the material using the internet in order to get my homework done on time. The course's confusing system of notation - not shared by ANY other class in the engineering department despite several others dealing with the same fundamental physics - did not help matters either..| Very good instructor, cared about the students and their understanding on the topic.| His approach to fluid dynamics was very effective at getting us to understand the subject..| Everything is very good. The professor accepted changes when needed..| My instructor did a great job in all the explanations and examples while teaching this course..| Lecturing style with the note writing and handouts is great to help me learn and pay attention..| He did a good job. The only thing i would change is he could do more examples..| He was defiantly a good professor and very well organized which made the class much easier than if a scattered professor had taught. The handouts were helpful in that pictures were very clear..| Dr. Sucosky did an excellent job with Fluid Dynamics, he took a very difficult course and made it manageable and enjoyable..| Explained topics well, provided plenty of examples, answered questions well, and treated students with respect.| Professor answered everyones questions to the best of his capabilities..| Dr. Philippe Sucosky is a good instructor..| I really would thank the instructor.| Some of the examples were more difficult and not too similar to what we saw on homework and exams. Dr. S explained examples very well, but also very fast. I feel like I would have done much better in the course if it was taught at a slower pace and if we went through more relevant examples..| your homework schedule and course material expectations need to change.  If you assign a set of homework and have the expectation that it should be done in a week and don't give the information necessary to do half the assignment until two days before it is due you are effectively shoving a weeks worth of homework into 2 days which is not reasonable.  If this happens once its just written off as a fluke, two or three times in a semester and it disengages students as they feel that ""the game is rigged"" and they feel that their efforts are best expended elsewhere.  Now I get that you have been traveling more than president Obama this semester, that everyone has their limits, and re-adjusting your homework schedule is hard especially when you make all your problems from scratch.  But, that might just indicate that your homework making process, while very detailed and impressive, might need some tweaking.  whether that means occasionally reusing some old problems,",2015 Fall
1813,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 12,"Yes, the instructor went step by step through each topic, explaining the steps and the motivation behind each step thoroughly..| Yes, his notes help the most with understanding material..| Made a very difficult topic much easier to understand.| He taught fluid dynamics a lot simpler than how the book taught..| I LOVE fluids after taking his class..| Yes.| He expected us to be professionals after the first day learning..| Coming to office hours was not helpful. At one point I was told to drop the class and retake it, which would have done absolutely nothing to fix my problems comprehending the material and would have irreparably screwed up the series of classes that I needed to graduate in four years.  Due to a schedule with conflicting classes there was no other way to get additional instruction. While in class, questions, requests for repeated explanations, and even clarifications of illegible sub- or superscripts were treated with thinly veiled resentment. Homework papers would be returned with entire sections marked wrong, and instead of an explanation of what I had done wrong or a specific step marked incorrect there would be a short insulting comment like ""Nope!"" or an illegible one word scrawl written next to an entire half-page block of equations. I wasn't able to get further clarifications on this sort of feedback early on in the semester, and gave up later on in favor of just trying to figure out my mistakes myself, which sometimes took hours of googling and pouring over the textbook, and sometimes just didn't happen. Because of Sucosky's hostility, I avoided interacting with him as much as I could..| Yes, always had review session before exam that were helpful and had a lot of office hours to help with the challenging homework..| The notes he provided were excellent..| Yes, he explained every details of the homework carefully when I needed..| My instructor was very helpful in aiding in my understanding of the subject; he often would make extra worksheets for notes that helped to teach the subject more in depth..| Yes, he's great at explaining difficult concepts..| Yes. he went over everything really well.| Yes, he was very helpful in his office hours..| Yes his guided notes and homework problems/solutions greatly helped my understanding of the material. It would be nice if all instructors adopted some of his practices..| The instructor did very well in aiding my understanding of this subject. He clearly answered all questions asked in class..| Absolutely, handouts provided by the instructor greatly helped the students to grasp these complex concepts. An awesome model for other professors!.| yes, a lot.| yes, although",2015 Fall
1814,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 13,"No further comments.| The textbook was incredibly unhelpful and did not match up to the material given by the professor. In addition, the homework counted for a large portion of the grade which was difficult when the homework was at times ahead of the material or problems not previously encountered in class or in the text. I wish the focus was more on completion and less on correct answers..| The french accent is definitely a plus..| All of the difficulty in getting notes down could have been avoided if he had uploaded scanned versions of the in class notes, or used PowerPoints instead of writing things on paper and then projecting them on a screen. Even using the whiteboard would have been more helpful, because more information would have been visible at any given time. This would have made it easier to comprehend how the example problems were being solved because the entire process would have been visible from start to finish and it would have made taking notes easier because of the increased time between erasures. I believe that the system used was designed to encourage attendance, or more precisely punish a lack of attendance. Missing class was nigh unrecoverable, because Sucosky almost never followed the systems used in the textbook and there was no way to get his class notes online. The grading scheme seemed to work to a similar end of punishing people who missed classes. Missing a single homework assignment would drop you almost a full letter grade, with subsequent missed assignments actually having progressively less effect on your overall grade..| Excellent, would take again. Just be prepared to work hard the ENTIRE semester and you will do okay..| Great professor, he made a very difficult course doable..| over all did a good job..| I really like the fact that the tests were open notes. Because I am awful at remembering stuff, but good at remembering where to look for the information..| Dr Sucosky made Fluids a great course, and peaked my interest in it. I am now considering thermal fluid engineering research for graduate school..| Even though Fluids is one of the hardest classes in the ME major, Sucosky was able to teach well and lead students through the course. I would recommend him to any student!.| Please consider the timing of the class. Fluid is a challenging course, and the time must be in the moorings or afternoons at least..| good instructor to deal with",2015 Fall
1815,ME 3350,Philippe Sucosky,Question 14,"None.| 2nd Best instructor in WSU after dr. Huang.| None.| Homework was extremely difficult..| The one time I warned him that I would be missing a class - a week beforehand - I was told in no uncertain terms that I would need to get the notes from someone else in the class. Aside from that fact that this presumes I have the contact information of someone else in that class (I didn't, it was week two) and forces me to rely on the clarity of another student's work, it didn't seem to be a restriction applied to everyone. Another student requested class materials in advance of an absence and was promised copies several days in advance. I don't know the full story of what was going on here, but it only contributed to the alienation I felt when dealing with Sucosky. I feel like this class tried to cover too much in too little time. Information was thrown at us with little attempt at joining it into a comprehensive holistic understanding of fluid dynamics. I left the class with a vague understanding of the material at best, and have already had to reteach some of the basic materials to myself for other classes (System Dynamics and Heat Transfer). If I have to take another higher level fluid dynamics focused class I don't know if I will have the necessary level of comprehension to begin learning new material..| Please post your in-class notes on Pilot for your future students.| I cannot draw goofy pictures on these online evaluations.

Did not learn anything from him..| Better than what I heard from last semester. Didn't use excel at all and didn't example problems from the book. Problem is the example problems are nowhere near as hard as the homework. It's impossible to do the homework because they use equations we don't even touch on in class. One particular assignment the TA told us that no one even got a part of the problem correct and there was 5 parts to it. They also said that the problem wasn't in the scope of the class. He's a nice guy and exams were not horrible. Lab reports are horrible due to not understanding the material from the course and not knowing what's going on in the lab..| He did a lot of examples in class and explained concepts..| teaches straight from book (not very effective).| Given the circumstances, he had a hard time teaching the material well. The book that he was teaching from was brand new to him as this was the first semester that he has used it. There are a lot of mistakes in the book itself. The material is very confusing and the lessons conveyed in the book are taught in a manner that might not be the most effective for undergraduate students. Also, we started from the middle of the book and skipped around in the chapters, so that made learning the material even more difficult.

Also, he brings problem that has been solved by the manual solution that is not solved well and not based on what we cover such as formulas, and equations. Therefore it was hard to follow and keep up with the class..| good.| Yes.| He takes pride in his work and he really does want the student to understand the subject. Some sections are difficult to understand and he tries to spend as much time as possible on them, but I was still having issues with a few..| Could be more effective.| Gd.| Not  a good teaching because of the new book the instructor sometimes skip some material because its new book.| He was good at teaching a topic that did not make too much sense..| He was okay. Felt like we started in the middle of subjects where a general knowledge was needed before we could start problems. For example, started statistics without going over what the symbols meant and it became more confusing than it should have been. Walked away from the class still not really knowing what I should have learned..| yes.| NOT BAD.| he is good, but I think he need to explain everything in better way.| It was a bit hard to follow in class. I would probably have benifitted from some more specific examples, not necessarily the ones in the book. It was a little better towards the end when he started using slideshows..| He was okay in terms of effectiveness.

I appreciate you work and time.| No.| I thought the MATLAB project was brutal.

Which it probably makes me look like I didn't do anything or start on it early, but I had a lot of projects this semester and when I did start on this project I was doing it wrong. I started to do the problem like how I would on paper because I didn't know how to do the while and if statements because ME students typically dont solve problems like that and I think MATLAB should be incorporated into the program more. We dont use MATLAB, because we cant use it on tests and most of the time we cant use it on our homework problems, so its pointless and a waste of time (At the time its a waste of time lol, but in terms of the future its not a waste of time.). I am not mad at you Menart, I'm mad at myself because I know my program sucks and I really wanted to do good and I didn't. It was just frustrating because I knew what to do but I couldn't do it in MATLAB, but I learned alot from it and I glad you made us do it and I just hope my grade on it is decent and not a F becuase initally I wrote out 16 equations by hand just to have to redo it all over again.

However, he sometimes did drag on a bit too long on tangential subjects. Though informational, the pace of the class doesn't allow for these types of side tracks..| very well.| In class Dr. Menart is very clear in his communication. He makes himself available outside of class by appointment or through office hours and generally is always willing to answer any questions you have..| DR.

He tried to make sure we understood the material, however, he was not the greatest teacher..| Along with being smart and intelligent in his subject, he had a sense of humor and a great personality that made you want to listen to him.

During class, He made a point to take breaks during the lecture during which he solicited feedback from the students in order to gauge our understanding of the topic. He also used this time to answer any questions that arose..| He answered questions after class if need be, had office hours, and didn't kill our grades like other professors would when the students didn't understand something.

2012,ME 3120,Akm Mian,Question 5,"Very responsive..| Very well.| he was super nice.| Excellent availability..| no answer..| Relatively effective.  He also made sure we knew when things we due and when exams were ,however, the actually class material was not communicated clearly..| Did fantastic. Always answered questions in class and sent emails. Only concern I had was the ""online quizzes,"" as I feel like I wasn't given a great ""heads up"" that there was one (on pilot). He did send an email about the quiz but some people don't check their email as much.

2016,ME 3210,Akm Mian,Question 1,"he is good instructor and he taught us well.| Ahsan Has a lot of heart and attempts to teach the class effectively, however I struggled in learning the material due to his frequent pauses to check his work, as well as the speed at which he wrote and the font size. overall he was a fair instructor however I would not recommend his classes..| very good.| Instructor was somewhat effective. Lectures were not the easiest to comprehend..| I felt the lectures were not very effective, I spent most of my time learning from the book and the online notes are very hard to follow for me..| He tried to teach us everything we needed to know and knew what he was doing most of the time. Sometimes though he did not know what was going on and stumbled around on problems a lot..| class work isn't always related to the homework. doesnt know how to do some of the homework that is assigned to us and gets lost in problems that he has the solutions to in his hands..| I don't think he ever comes to class prepared, its almost like he shows up and the first thing to come into his head he just starts teaching about it with absolutely no plan of action..| He is very effective.  He does a lot of example problems and answers students' questions..| Tends to not be organized.| not effective, examples were poorly explained and more often then not left unfinished because either Mian got confused half way through or we were supposed to know how to do the rest despite not being taught the rest..| Not effective.| good.| I felt like I did not learn anything new if this class. I also felt that there was a lack of organization or structure to the class, and was often confused about what we were learning, or how it was applied..| Not very effective.| Overall the lectures feel uncoordinated and unprepared.  The professor seems to dither and repeat himself a lot.  I and other students repeatedly feel unprepared for all homework assignments and exams.| Not a good instructor just isn't good at getting he point a cross..| Pretty effective, my only real complaint was that sometimes his teaching wouldn't match how things were set up in the course book..| somewhat, seemed to be ""scattered"" during lecture..| Great instructor.| Very ineffective. He is very unclear in his lecturing. This is because of lack of direction, frequent mistakes (multiple per example typically), and not fully solving problems.  By lack of direction, I mean that it is not clear where he is going or what he is doing. Often times, he will pull an equation without telling us where it came from or why we are using it.  He makes many mistakes during example problems. These mistakes are typically a missed variable or exponent. These are easily fixed on the board, but not so easily fixed on paper, especially when the error was noticed only after a few steps. This sometimes renders multiple pages of notes useless. When I can fix a mistake in my notes, it usually takes a few minutes for me to fix the problem, in which time he has moved on.  It is very common for him to stop doing a problem halfway and move on to something else. The result of this is that I have a decent understanding of how to do a problem up to a certain point, then no clue after that point..| he is a perfect professor in system dynamics.| GOOD.| I would describe the overall effectiveness of this instructor as very low.  I and many of my classmates felt lost for most of the class, as he did not effectively explain anything that he was speaking about.  There was very little actual teaching that went on in the lectures, almost no discussion of class materials.  Many times the professor seemed to be confused as to what he was doing, as well.  I will be leaving this class feeling like I have learned absolutely nothing about control systems..| good.| Lectures could use more structure in my opinion..| So effective. It was unreal.

He should sit down with Dr. Scott Thomas and adopt some of his teaching habits. The most helpful would be the prewritten notes that he rewrites during lecture. That way, Dr. Mian will not make nearly as many mistakes. It would be useful for him to give a very short breakdown of each example problem, i.e. what each step is and why we were doing it. He would have to stay focused on this area and take no more than 5 minutes.  Overall, I can tell Dr. Mian really cares about his students. His disorganization, however, is severely crippling his effectiveness..| GOOD.| I would avoid any other classes with this instructor if possible..| nope.| Thanks.| If another professor were teaching I would retake the class..| He genuinely wants everyone to pass, but his grading is off and his teaching is very unorganized.",2016 Fall

However, I felt like the second half of the course on Hydrogen storage was lack luster. 50% of the time was spent in the lab learning how to use Gauss View. I felt like it was a waste and the time would have been better spent learning about actual storage methods rather then messing in a lab and using a program that I will never use again. In addition Dr. Farajian would provide example problems in class, but make us solve them ourselves in class and not show us how to solve the problems. While I understand that this was a 7000 level class and some self teaching is required, I would still expect some level of demonstration on how to apply the theories in a problem solving scenario..| no.| No.| No Comments.| no.| No additional comments.| no.| Why on earth is this course listed for a Mechanical Engineering student?

Group work outside of class was also helpful, although I did have groupmates who would reliably attempt the work on their own before discussing it, so there was no concern about someone not contributing. Not that any changes necessarily need to be made, but if the course changes its form in the future, I think expanding the projects is one direction it could go in.

2040,ME 1040,Sara Mirmasoudi,Question 1,"Mrs. Mirmasoudi was very effective in her teaching. She took the time to explain how to fulfill tasks in SOLIDWORKS. Whenever there was a problem, she was very understanding; especially with computer crashes, which happened quite often..| Somewhat effective.| The instructor was effective in teaching the material for the class. Prior skills learned in the class were built upon in order to create an understanding of the course material..| Very understanding of new student's experience, and worked with said students to allow them to better understand the material. Her assigned work tested and pushed our understandings effectively, and allowed us to learn new material at a steady rate. She made the class very interesting and enjoyable ..| She used her past experiences to teach us how to use many different features in Solid Works. The main way she would teach was by demonstrating a certain skill and then telling us to do the same thing for ourselves, which was very effective for learning new things..| Poor.| Okay..| Slightly below average.| Sara is a very informational teacher and very effective.| Good.| Good..| The only problem I had with the instructor is that she went slightly fast, but she did pause throughout the class period to make sure everyone could catch up..| Did an okay job. Sometimes a little unclear  and abstract during lessons and course materials. Taught a lot of material myself.| She knew what she was doing most of the time. she needs to slow down for some students because shell do an on and off thing where she'll slow down so people can catch up then go racing ahead, stop, then repeat..| She was very good and knowledgeable..| The instructor was able to teach the skills necessary for a student to learn the basics of Solidworks..| This instructor taught a lot very efficiently..| Overall, she was an effective instructor and I enjoyed her class. At the beginning, she went through material too quickly, but throughout the course, she altered that and presented material at a more comfortable speed..| Has students teach the class..| She was not that clear in her instruction..| This instructor is great.| Very knowledgeable about the content and the program, however, she did not always convey it well enough. She would go too fast at point and not provide supplemental help. But when you would reach out to her, she was always extremely helpful and effective..| very helpful and involved in the class, taught from personal experience.| The teacher constructed lectures very quickly and were hard to follow..| she is a good a instructor but their are issues. One is that she flies through lectures and a lot of people get behind because they have never had experience with 3-D modeling. Another issue is that she expects to do one thing on a task, but when its due she changes her mind right before its due..| I believe she was a very effective instructor for solidworks. I learned all of the information I needed for the design tasks and projects within the class..| The teacher was overall very useful. She went over everything without anything being way too difficult..| She knows what she is talking about, BUT she teachers us like we are interns and we are freshmen in a beginner course. some students have not been exposed to a 3D modeling program..| She did not always allow time for questions and a lot of the class fell behind during class..| Not as effective as I would have liked..| Haphazard instruction consistent with a novice instructor. I have no doubt she knows exactly what she's doing in Solidworks, but communicating it to a group of students isn't her strong suit..| its very fast so it makes it hard to follow along. also notes aren't posted onto pilot so it makes it very hard to retain information.| Her teaching helped me establish a better hold on other modeling programs, overall effective!.| Sometimes it was difficult to keep up and understand what was being taught..| good.| She was able to explain topics well and help students with problems. She did not understand some of the struggles faced by many of the students, but overall showed a desire to help them. The only issue came with her organization. Many of the assignments and instructions lacked details, that she could not provide. She utilized the departments assignments, so many times she would not know certain instructions were in the assignment, or were missing from the assignment..| Much of the instructor's effectiveness was altered by factors she could not control-mainly computer issues in the classroom.  However, she communicated information effectively, and did her best to fix whatever problems came up and answer any questions as quickly as possible..| Shes very good and she knows what she is doing.| The effectiveness of the instructor was effective to a certain extent. Not very effective after halfway through the course because she does not explain the directions of the assigned tasks well enough..| I believe the instructor did a good job in teaching the course information..| she didn't wait for anybody.| Very knowledgeable in the subject matter.

I do not believe letting us out early was a problem because she taught everything we needed. Every time we were released early, the class became open lab and we were allowed to work on homework and ask questions. If people did not ask questions during this time, it was their own fault..| We would be let out early sometimes, but this did not happen often..| class always started on time. the end time varied depending on the information being taught..| Yes.| Class started on time.  However, class ended in open lab where we could leave so I don't know about whether the class ended on time or not..| Yes. Except for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving Break. I waited all day for a 20-minute class where we learned about things that were mostly irrelevant to the course requirements.

She also left time for students to ask questions and finish lab work..| No.  Often the class ended very early.  The lectures were short; however, the instructor always kept the room open for Open Lab for the rest of the class period, and remained until everyone had left to answer any questions the students had..| She started class on time and used the full period as an open lab.| She started the class on time and regularly ended class very early..| The instructor started the class on time everyday and used most of the time.

Great job!.| Excellent Professor.| By FAR one of the best professors I have had at Wright State and I look forward to taking his other classes in near future!.| No, I do not have any additional comments..| Nope, except that he is the best teacher I have had in the past few years at Wright State. He should get a raise and be invited to share his teaching methods with all the other teachers:  for example, I like how he anticipates our learning curve and most efficiently directs it higher by absolutely refraining from burdening his students with time-costly micromanagement.",2016 Fall
2064,ME 2120,Scott Thomas,Question 1,"Very effective.| The professor provided adequate data for a student to learn, but he did not teach the materials of the class very well..| Instructor was at time unclear about explanations but was overall effective..| Very effective instructor. Willing to answer any questions and uses class time very well..| Dr. Thomas clearly and effectively taught this course..| Good.| Very Effective.| very good.| Was very effective.| The teaching style did not match my learning style, so I haven't learned as much as I would like from this class. However, the instructor was very informative and the information learned in class was relevant to the homework assigned..| Absolutely amazing professor that really knows how to explain hard subjects. Very fair and makes everyone feel like it's okay to ask questions.| Extremely effective. He knows exactly what students will struggle with and knows exactly how to help them..| Dr. Thomas is incredibly effective in the way he instructs the course. 10 out of 10..| Professor Thomas is a good teacher..| Used all of class time for examples, helped if someone didn't understand how to do anything..| Excellent professor, perhaps my favorite thus far at the university. Very motivated to teach, engaging, and thorough in explanations..| He was very effective I think. The material was hard but he was able to describe it in a way that was a little easier to understand..| I really liked scott as a professor he was very knowledgeable and for the most part i understood what he was trying to explain to us. Loved the way the class was set up, would always remind us when homework was due and when tests were coming up. Also loved how he made everything available to use such as previous homework or exams so we could study. Exams were pretty tough but that is expected when learning a hard subject..| He would go through several examples in class, but I wish he would go through how to better look at statics problems and how to effectively draw free body diagrams..| Very Good.| Very effective! Scott Thomas is easily the best professor I have had so far at Wright State.  It is obvious that he knows his stuff, and he keeps the class entertaining.  I hope to take more courses with Professor Thomas in the future..| Dr. Thomas is very efficient with his teaching. He gets straight to the point while still keeping the class fun and interesting..| Lectures were very effective. Scott made the class interesting and tied the lectures to real world situations. Compared to other classes, students respect Scott and are always coming to class prepared to learn the material and are never disappointed in the material that is taught..| Very excited, interesting professor. I think his only issues are: - Too much homework - never goes over Working Model 2D in class - Suffers from an issue I think a lot of professors have, which is not being able to put himself in the position of a student who is brand new to the material. It seems a lot of the important details get skipped over in class.  Overall, though, he is very hard working and does a good job. He is very fair to the students and is always available for help..| Scott is pretty effective however he could do a better job by going through the steps of each problem.  However the lectures didn't really prepare for the exams and a review would be greatly appreciated..| The instructor, Scott Thomas, is very good at teaching statics, and has an obvious and infectious love for the subject that translates well into learning..| Very efffective.| very effective..| Very effective. Went through multiple example problems in class that helped greatly with my understanding..| I have had Dr. Thomas before, and I always feel like I learn a lot from his classroom. He is very effective..| Very effective, was clearly excited about the class, making it very enjoyable..| He's a fantastic teacher. His lectures or notes are very well organized and easy to follow. You can tell he tries to make the material as interesting as it gets. He likes to relate the topics we cover in class to real life situations or applications. This is extremely helpful. Most teachers don't give their students the time of day but the opposite can be said of Scott Thomas. He is 100% willing to help his students understand in class and outside of the classroom..| Excellent Professor.| He was a very good instructor. Lessons were taught step by step, and his teaching was very efficient..| I don't think I've ever had a better instructor.

He is passionate about the field of engineering and he wants his students to succeed..| Instructor was decently effective. He is very passionate about his job and loves what he does. He was fair in all assessments and was always there to help. Although he was very passionate and helpful I don't think he did a good job of explaining the topics. For each topic he would explain a little and then spend the rest of the time doing examples. When doing examples, he didn't explain his steps very well and I was often left feeling confused. I think it would be more helpful to do a little less example problems and a little more explaining the approach and the thought process behind it..| He was pretty effective.| Very enthusiastic and interested in what he was teaching, therefore making the learning environment better..| Excellent.| Very effective, passionate about his field and very well versed in the material.

Very fair class and well balanced..| Great Professor, cares and gives students resources.| no.| I appreciate the small amount of bonus given for attending class. It is a helpful reward to those who want to come to class and learn, without being detrimental to the students' grades for necessary absences. For the amount of time it takes to complete the homework and amount of effort it requires, the homework should be a larger part of the overall grade. Although the exams are important to test our knowledge, the homework is a good way to determine if we understand the content before taking the exams and only ended up being a small portion of our grade. Also, it was very inconvenient to scan the homework and submit it electronically. It would have been much more beneficial to turn in a paper copy, which could be marked up to show students' mistakes and returned, as opposed to reading the less informative comments available to see in the drop box. Especially since we had to work it all out on paper anyway. Also, a big emphasis on fairness is placed on the grading in this class, however the second exam was much harder than intended and curved for the students who turned it in (I was unaware that there was a possibility that the exams could be curved). Students who decided to not turn it now have a final that is the majority of their grade and received no compensation for the exam that the class as a whole was not adequately prepared for. This set up benefits the students already doing well in the class, and further hurts the students who are struggling..| Hope to have him again because I really learn a lot more with him than any other professor.| Scott is an excellent professor. He is very helpful in class with questions and during office hours. He is great at explaining the material and providing all of the material needed to do well in the class.

Awesome professor. I hope I have the opportunity to take more courses with him!.| o.| I really enjoyed his enthusiasm that he had when conducting the class. It could have been a really dry and boring class but he made it interesting. The material itself was hard not him. He did have hard tests but it was to make sure you really knew the material in order to show that this material may have lives at stake when know the structures of towers, beams, and etc..| Loved the class and loved the way he teaches. Only complaint would be I wish he would explain more on what he did to get certain steps instead of writing straight from the notes, but overall was a wonderful professor and would gladly take again..| Prof Thomas seems to really want everyone to succeed and you can definitely tell that he cares about our learning but I kind of wish we could've walked through certain things a little slower since it takes me a little while to completely grasp this kind of stuff.

The material was easy to keep up with and I learned a lot! If I would change anything, it would be helpful if somewhere on pilot/dropbox there was a list of exactly what was expected to be turned in for each design task (rather than occasional repetition in class) since the expectations rarely matched exactly what was in the instruction document on pilot..| I think you should do another project instead of a final :^).| I think this class will be much more organized now that he has taught it for a year..| Nope..| Overall very good teacher. I would recommend him as a  professor to anybody wanting to take this course..| Both TA's were great with help.

He taught me about not only the industry I look forward to becoming apart of, but also his specific course and how they intertwined..| Dr. Bob did a good job of taking only the good things from the book and going into more explanation where the book was lacking.

He took so much out of his personal time in order to make sure the whole class knew all the material..| Overall, very effective professor. Taught the class very well and went above and beyond to make sure that the students really understood the material. A bit inappropriate at times people may say, but funny and entertaining.

Most instructors that I have taken had no interest in whether the class learned or not. I can confidently say that I won't be forgetting everything once the semester is finished..| He took time to make sure that the students understood the material by giving real-world examples that engineers face in everyday situations.

This isn't Dr. Bob's fault, and it is to his credit that he made the effort. CECS and WSU need to provide better support and infrastructure to adjuncts if they are indeed going to be reliant on adjunct instructors. Pay the man enough to justify coming in for additional office hours, and provide some level of office space. Again, we managed due to his willingness to stick around after class, but that's not a sustainable arrangement..| The instructor did communicate effectively in and out of the classroom..| Very..| Well.| Good communication.

2117,ME 3310,Bob Leiweke,Question 6,"Yes.| One critique I would give to Dr. Leiweke is to refine his notes and paperwork before posting them for students.  Often times he would find mistakes in his previously made notes that he would have to edit on the fly and there were always updates to pilot and emails saying I fixed this or re wrote that ""a new copy is posted to pilot"".  It became confusing sifting through all the variations to find the correct one.  Another would be instead of reading through previously worked out problems from his notes, do them by hand on the board and work through it with the students..| I liked the way he presented the material, but it seemed like he was still getting his lectures in order. he redid a portion near the end of the class and there were many calculation mistakes in the reorganized part.| Very well organized..| Yes, it can be seen that the instructor cares and takes pride in his teaching.

2119,ME 3310,Bob Leiweke,Question 8,"Dr. Leiweke is hands down my in my top two teachers ive had here at Wright State because he is a bit unorthodox but really relates to his students.

That alone makes me want to work harder and earn that respect for myself..| please stop talking about pig pen. this isn't about it being something nobody cares about, but the repetitiveness made me tune out.| I wish he would teach Thermo II as well.| Overall, I give him an effective rate of 95%..| I hope Dr. Bob continues to teach at Wright State because he is one of the best lecturers I've ever had.| The instructor needed a TA/s in the class.

2120,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"not very effective.| I feel like this instructor could improve in effectiveness. Could do a better job gaining the interest of the class..| Good instructor, didn't learn well with the structure of the class..| he helps us understand the material by making us reading the book and commenting. and he takes the questions we ask and lecture on them for more understanding..| I did not feel that they were effective at all teaching us the material.  We basically were expected to learn all the material ourselves by reading the textbook and answering each others questions.  The lectures were also not helpful and the information covered did not seem to apply to our homework or quiz's..| With the in-class exercises, group quizzes, and homework discussions, he made the class easy for us..| This teacher was consistently ineffective at communicating material to his students, consistently unable  to submit files and upload documents needed for homework assignments. Very frustrating overall, I walk away from this class not having learned anything, but how to struggle through homework and barely pass quizzes. Not what I paid for.| Better as the year went on.| I think Raghu was an effective instructor. I am not sure the way that the class was setup was though. I found it a little hard to learn..| Very great class spook very clear to the students and made sure we understood the topic. Also loved the way the class was set up..| He was an ok instructor.| Not good.| Overall, Dr. S was an effective professor.  I feel relatively confident about my knowledge relating to this course, though I chalk it more up to a lacking on my part, more so than anything lacking on Dr. S's end..| ..| Not effective. Would have learned more in five minutes with a Learning Assistant than I ever learned from this professor..| The instructor was not capable of commanding the attention of the students, with the out of class reading and annotations being the majority of the work in the class, and taught through power points so it is not a very effective teaching method..| He had a large amount of knowledge on the subject and was effective at explaining..| somewhat effective..| The lessons that he taught were communicated pretty effectively. However, he did not always cover the topics that were read about, and these I had trouble understanding..| He was clearly knowledgeable of the material, but the classroom style was ineffective with my learning process..| Srinivasan was not an effective teacher what so ever. I learned absolutely nothing this semester in his structures and properties of mathematics class. I know the material the class covers is not the most interesting topic, but his class was something else. Every time he would go to lecture, it would be over the annotations/readings we had completed before the class. He wouldn't give any additional information on how to complete actual problems. When our class would go to complete exercise problems, he would walk around and not answer any questions our table had..| moderate at best- the ""scale up"" class format as practiced at wright state leads to an over reliance on technology, which can be finicky to say the least.  Making the class size much smaller would also help..| The instructor, from what I have heard about the other sections of this same class, was much more effective with his teaching method (requiring that the students read and annotate). The only thing I could recommend to make the material 'stick' even more is to have more quizzes (one for every chapter)..| Not very effective. He expected us to understand some pretty difficult material by only reading the book, which was poorly written in my opinion. When it came time for lecture, he would basically reiterate what the book said, and wouldn't explain any further..| I thought Dr. S, wasn't that effective. He had do a lot of readings in the book, which was fine, but most of the students truly didn't understood what they were reading because we were reading the book to get all the points for the readings versus reading the book to understand it. This contributed to the fact that Dr. S was not very effective because, again most students didn't understand the readings, then we'd come in and not get a good lecture and then were expected to do problems that we had no clue where to start then on top of all of it, he'd give quizzes in which the graduate teaching assistance had some troubles on a few quizzes, most of students would fail the quizzes..| He was okay.| Raghu was very effective in structuring the class in a way to optimize student learning as long as the students were motivated to do it..| He was effective in teaching us this semseter.| Decently effective professor. The teaching style was not necessarily the best due to online annotations and technology issues as well as some communication issues as to when annotations were do.

2125,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"Yes.| yes.| Yes.| For the most part. The majority of the lecture and reading was conceptual with some example problems and the quizzes were conceptual, but the homework was all math problems. It would have been more beneficial to have the homework be conceptual, so I could better understand the content, than to include specific math problems that didn't benefit my understanding..| yes.| No.  Since it was a flipped classroom we were expected to learn most of the material ourselves and when he did give lectures the information did not really apply to our homework or quizzes..| Yes..| No, class seemed to jump around from point to point, and did not demonstrate a cohesiveness expected in a collegiate classroom..| yes.| Yes, he tried to answer our questions that we made online to ensure that we understood the material and the concept of the material..| Yes lectures would be tailored to what we didn't understand in the readings and made sure we understood what was going on..| yes.| Yes..| ..| No. not at all.

It was mostly long lectures about material that most of the class had read days ago. This made class time very stale sometimes but he did do a good job of trying to make sure that every student had a clear understanding..| yes, followed syllabus provided.| Yes, we had a schedule and stayed on it..| The followed the plan by chapters, but the lectures were not greatly representative of quizzes..| Yes..| yes.| The course content was organized very well and defined in the course schedule..| Not really. At the beginning of the semester, he said that it wouldn't be a class where he lectured a lot. But after a couple of weeks passed, that's all he did.  There was also a point in time where he had to totally change the schedule because we were so behind.

2127,ME 2700,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 8,"I know this class is still working out kinks as a scale up, so it was hard to start class on time while trying to get all the software up. If anyone complains about the annotations, the instructor had examples for us at the beginning of the course and told us to do at least five per reading. It was easy to get good scores on them if you followed the examples he had set. I would suggest adding a couple conceptual questions into the homework (on top of the other problems) this would help kids prepare for the quizzes. I know I struggled with the quizzes sometimes because they covered a lot of material (which is fine since, that meant less quizzes.).| lectured in class for too long for a scale up class, nobody payed attention didnt actually learn very much but will come out of class with a or b.| Instructor could do a better job gaining the class' attention and interest..| The annotations weren't set up well. Some sections were around 10 pages, which wasn't enough content for around 20 students to include 5 or more annotations on. Some sections were 30+ pages which took over 3 hours to read and annotate, which seemed excessive when there were two to three annotation/reading assignments due each week..| I hated the flipped classroom.  I feel like I did not learn anything, and what I did learn I had to teach myself.  The computer automatically grading the annotations was ridiculous and so were the quizzes, especially considering they didn't even work half of the time. The clickers were a waste of money.  I also have trouble reading online textbooks so I hated that we had to read that one.  I much rather would have had a physical textbook..| Please learn to teach in a scale up classroom, this was terrible.| nope.| I enjoyed his end course project which was fun and enjoyable. He was a really nice guy and was easy to talk to or even go to. I did not go to him outside of class but I would not have had a problem with it..| Overall loved the way the class was set up and a very wonderful teacher who wanted the best for us..| The lectures were quite boring and I don't really feel like I've learned all that much throughout the class but I do think the professor genuinely wants students to learn. I think the class would benefit from more interactive learning methods and more interesting presentations..| ..| This class was a complete joke. Did not learn a solitaire thing. Was never taught anything. Made to do annotations that were online and this was the only way to ""learn"". Professor rarely lectures and when he does he is so monotone and boring class does not pay attention..| Perusall and ""Clickers"" are not a good way to teach.  The clickers hardly work, the software associated with them, responseware, hardly works, and Perusall, while a good way to provide the book, does not help students to understand things, they simply read because they have to but do not learn. It is also not a good idea to not have tests, as the level of knowledge in the class is very low, but is not tested, so everyone will pass..| No..| the ebook used was horrible.  I know the allure of being able to monitor and track students progress through the material, but the software used (perusal) was buggy, its grading algorithm was not transparent, and its search system never worked, making it hard to do the in class activities and homework.  just try scrolling from the section you are on to a table in the back of the book and back in a time efficient manner.  It was more effective to google the information I needed, which then begs the question as to why do we need this ebook except as a study tracker, and if that is all it is why is it so expensive?.| I don't think the way that this class was set up really worked well--maybe for another subject, but not something as difficult to understand as this. I liked the idea of group work, but we never really did much of that. I didn't like the Perusall annotations at all. I think I would have learned much more if we didn't have to basically teach ourselves..| No.| No further comments..| No.| No.| This class is the definition of technology overload. As far as education is concerned, I do believe there are ways that technology can enhance learning, but there are also ways in which it can get in the way. This class was a very good example of how technology gets in the way.  I think going forward, it'd be best to change the structure of the class. Lose the annotations, along with clicker quizzes and the reflections. It might be a good idea to have the class flow in a way similar to the Solidworks classes. The teacher lectures for the first 30 minutes or so, then allow the students to work through some of the related homework problems. Then perhaps the teacher lectures for another 30 minutes. After that the rest of class time is spent allowing the groups to work through the homework. Homework is given on Monday, with a due date of Wednesday the following week perhaps. Each lecture will function as time for the professor to teach new material and then open ""lab"" time for students to work through homework. Each student must submit his or her own homework, but there's time given to collaborate in solving the problems with extra time out of class to work on it. The quizzes would be taken the day the homework is turned in. There can still be the individual and group quizzes, but they can be given on the laptops through Pilot rather than having to use a clicker. I don't understand the point of having students purchase clickers and a license to do what the classroom itself is already designed to do with the use of the laptops at every table. Especially when many of the students have to make the purchase that will only be used for just that semester and that class. I feel like there wasn't enough thought put into that decision. The annotations are worse. Requiring the students to purchase/rent a text that they can only access online just to take notes? In addition, there's no feedback on what the student didn't succeed at if they receive a score less than the full amount. It basically turned into skimming, looking for keywords, then googling and copying and paste stuff just to get points. It doesn't actually encourage the student to learn.  I think it's important to remember that sometimes ""simple"" is a good thing. There was too much going on with this class that it felt disjointed. I know it wasn't the intention, but it made it hard to follow along and absorb the material. Too much time was wasted waiting for the professor to figure out how to get something to work properly. That was time that could have been spent lecturing. Overall, I feel like I learned less than if it had just been a simple lecture with homework and tests..| No.| Thank you for actually caring whether or not we learned..| no",2016 Fall
2128,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 1,"In this type of classroom setting, I didn't find Dr. Srinivasan's teaching style to be very effective..| Dr. S teaches well and I enjoyed his class. Needs to do more examples. My classmates and I requested more in-class examples to work through problems and we never got them. Made the homework hard as well as the quizzes..| Dr. Srinivasan was very good at lecturing over the subject. The only thing that was not effective with this class was the flipped classroom approach. This approach did not aid in my learning because just reading the book and seeing no examples of the material that we read is just a memorization exercise. In order for this class to be more effective, there needs to be more lectures and example problems given in class. The quizzes need to be based on what is lectured as well as what is in the homework and not just random parts of chapters. Some of the problem were purely a guessing game at some points, since the phrase had been rooted deep in the chapter in a place that was very easy to skip over. Overall, great professor but bad class setup..| Not effective, lectures were scrambled and didn't learn much from them..| Lenient..| He's a good instructor, but I wish I didn't have to learn out of a book.

2133,ME 4770,Raghavan Srinivasan,Question 6,"There weren't really any lectures, which to me was disappointing. I had heard that he was a great instructor from other students who had taken this class with him before it was changed to flipped learning style. With Perusall, the confusion reports it generates aren't really as good a judge of where students are struggling because if students are graded on the content of their annotations, they tend to comment more on the parts that they understand better. It was hard to figure out how well we needed to know parts of the material because there were no lectures to guide us..| Yes, the book is a work in progress but overall it was organized well..| No, the ""lectures"" were just going over what annotations within the book had the most confusion and then talking about parts of the chapter. Since we had to read 10-15 pages per assignment and annotate, a lot of annotations were done with the intent of getting it done. Since everything was group based with homework and quizzes, it did not give any kind of incentive for us to read and thoroughly understand the chapter on our own. This was also the case because even if we did read it, we would come into class and have it be re read to us. In order for this class to be as beneficial as it should be, there needs to be key points hit at the beginning of the semester of what the main aspects of metals are structurally, and do a revisit to structures and properties then proceed to the mechanical testing and properties and come back to why things work based on the structure. This class just did not help me learn in a coherent fashion of what the behavior of metals is supposed to be..| No.| yes.| Yes, as far as the inverted classroom model allows.",2016 Fall

I am not sure I agree with how perusall grades annotations and more time needs to be taken by the instructor to understand comments that are made. Perusall might even have hindered us as students because we were more worried about trying to please perusall with our comments rather than learn the subject in our own way and make it stick. Also, with such a small class, groups are hard to divide fairly. There were only 4 teams in this class and 2 seemed to far outweigh the others. This seems unfair as you are now relying on your group to teach you instead of the instructor..| Stop doing Perusall. Stop flipped classroom..| He used a scale up approach and I think this shows an interest in our learning. The effectiveness of this approach might not be as good as it could be but I think it's a step in the right direction..| Due to the teaching style of this course, this has been my least favorite course of my entire bachelors degree. The flipped classroom was something I was not prepared for, and when the questions were asked, the answers given were not great. They went around the question instead of getting to the point. Mandatory group quizzes and assignments cause some people in the course to get free rides to better grades. Book was not complete, and information in the book was not concise enough..| I want to express a general sentiment of displeasure with inverted classrooms. It's a good idea in principle, but flawed in practice. Other than that, good luck with getting your book finished, and thank you for the good semester.",2016 Fall

2147,ME 4820,Hong Huang,Question 4,"Great!.| She took the time to explain concepts I didn't understand, even when I felt I was holding up the class. She also had a very apparent grasp on time usage and knew that she could take the time to explain a concept more thoroughly without jeopardizing the overall pace and schedule..| good.| Stops to make sure you understand",2016 Fall

2152,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 1,"Great job!!.| He was effective..| Overall, it is good..| I think he was a great professor. I think he challenged us in the course, but was always willing to help when we got stuck. I think his website was very helpful in keeping all of his notes, codes, and homework in one place..| Very effective, but he has to realise a lot of persons left undergrad a long time ago. And so, he should try to be as simple as possible to carry everyone along..| Very effective..| Great!.| In my opinion, Dr. Slater could have been more effective as an instructor. He seemed to be very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but did not effectively transfer that knowledge to the class. He stressed the importance of asking questions, but would often playfully belittle students who asked questions. I think this discouraged more students from asking questions freely.",2016 Fall
2153,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 2,"Yes.| Yes..| No he didn't and My tests evaluation weren't good, I was expecting more. I am not sure from the projects evaluation yet..| I'm not sure - I wish he would have returned grades for the class.If he passed back the homework it would have been beneficial for studying for exams. Also, we did not get any project grades back. Since it was worth 40% of our grade, it would have been nice to know where we stood in the class.  I'm probably just being too picky - I'm the type who likes to know exactly where I stand in the class grade wise and it was a tad frustrating not knowing where I stood in the class..| Yes.| Yes, he did..| Yes!.| As far as I know at this time, yes. We submitted a few homework assignments, two projects, and have taken two tests. We are in the last week of classes and have only received the two tests back from him.",2016 Fall

2155,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 4,"By wanting to answer all of our questions.| He answered questions in class..| He did it in a good way..| Yes! You could tell he wanted all of his student to succeed. He gave us practice exams for each exam so we could have an idea how the problem would be setup. He always answered any of our questions to the best of his ability..| Well.| He made three projects working in group to inspire the interest of student..| Yes!.| Yes, he made himself available outside of class, allowed for questions during class periods, and briefly reviewed exam questions to ensure that we understood our mistakes.",2016 Fall
2156,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 5,"Great.| He communicated well..| Great.| Yes! He made himself very approachable inside and outside of class. He always returned student's emails in a very timely manner and had a website where we could make appointments to meet with him. He was always willing to help!.| Always.| It was effective. He answered questions pretty well..| 5 on 5.| Dr. Slater communicated well. He maintained good lecture notes. He made his past exams available for review. However, as stated before, he was often condescending and sometimes overtly offensive to students in the classroom.",2016 Fall
2157,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 6,"Yes.| Yes..| Not that much..| Yes, he had the notes for the entire semester posted online the very first day of class.

2159,ME 7120,Joseph Slater,Question 8,"Too many jokes..| Would definitely have learned more effectively if more examples were worked out in class. It was sometimes difficult to see how a concept was actually applied and therefore hard to duplicate on projects and exams..| His exam questions are not expected and the student ps don't know what to read in order to pass his tests. His questions are tricky and he chooses the questions based on what we missed during his speech in the class..| One of the best professors I've ever had! I really enjoyed taking his class this semester!.| Not much..| One of the great professors i have studied under.| I believe Dr. Slater is a good professor who demonstrated a deep understanding of this course's material. He was entertaining and witty, but this sometimes showed itself negatively in condescending and offensive comments. Some students can handle these comments well, but others could be discouraged from speaking up in class.",2016 Fall
